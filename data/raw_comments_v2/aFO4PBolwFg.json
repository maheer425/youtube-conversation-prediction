            "text": "For the math people out there, Bernoullli's principle is what you get when \nyou do a force balance on a infinitesimally small volume element of the \nfluid (assumed inviscid). You would use differential calculus to express \nthis. Newton's 3rd law is what you get when you do a force balance over the \ncontrol volume around the system of interest, using integral calculus. They \nare two expressions each describing the same physical situation, consistent \nwith each other. \n\nBernoulli explanation: \nBernoulli's principle tells us that whenever you have a velocity change \nalong a streamline, it will be accompanied by a pressure change. This is \nwell confirmed experimentally. And indeed you do have a velocity change as \nthe air passes above and below the wing, and indeed you do have pressure \nchanges. Pressure x area = Force, and that force acts on the wing. \nBernoulli's principle is indeed relevant to producing lift. \n\nNewton's 3rd law explanation: \nAs a consequence of that low pressure on top of the wing, downward momentum \nis imparted to the air flowing above that low pressure zone. The derivative \nof momentum with respect to time is force. So we have the wing imparting a \ndownward force to the air, and by Newton's 3rd law, the air is imparting an \nupward force to the wing. \n\nIMPORTANT -- the force arising from these two effects (pressure and \nmomentum change of air) are not additive. It's the same force. These are \ntwo different ways of expressing the result of the SAME PHYSICAL PROCESS \ntaking place. Bernoulli Principle is a force balance at microscopic scale. \nNewton's 3rd law is a force balance at the macroscopic scale. Both apply, \nboth are consistent, both give you approximately the same answer. \n\nBut HERE is where the common explanation using Bernoulli's Principle often \ngoes wrong. It is often said that the air goes faster over the top of the \nwing because it is more curved, so it has longer to travel in order to meet \nup with the air below the wing that it was separated from. WRONG! First, \nthere is no constraint that a parcel of air divided at the leading edge \nmust meet up at the trailing edge. Second, aerodynamicists have known for a \nvery long time from wind tunnel testing that the air traveling over a wing \nproducing lift will always reach the trailing edge first. It never does \n\"meet back up\" with the air below. This is true for an airfoil or just a \nsimple flat plate. Third, just consider some examples -- aerobatic \nairplanes have symmetrical airfoils with the same curvature top and bottom. \nHang gliders just have a singe layer of fabric, thus the same distance of \ntravel above or below. The Wright Flyer has a very thin cambered wing where \nthe distance along the wing surface above and below is the same. All of \nthese wings produce lift. How? \n\nWell that question gets more complicated. It has to do with the generation \nof a low pressure zone above the wing (which results in the change in \nvelocity viz a viz Bernoulli) and circulation theory. You can look that \nstuff up if you want to dig into it further. \ufeff",

(;-)...I will, however, pick a few nits with \nyou....1) Saying simply: \"a velocity change ....accompanied by a pressure \nchange\" avoids any cause and effect statement and, I feel ,helps support \nthe misunderstanding that fluid speed causes lower pressure which violates \nNewton's messages to us, as well as reality.  Fluid (a mass) is accelerated \nby pressure diffrences (a force) and this is a net force from a high to a \nlow pressure region....wind ... and it explains air accelerating around the \nleading edge and over the top both radially and tangentially (the curved \npath and the speed increase).  Leaf blower and TP demos of Entrainment \nabound on the web pretending to be Bernoulli's \"Principle\" demos. ...2) \nThen, I feel the following two comments are contradictory  A) \"As a \nconsequence of that low pressure on top of the wing, downward momentum is \nimparted to the air flowing above....NOTE \"consequence of\"   B)  \"two \ndifferent ways of expressing the result of the SAME PHYSICAL PROCESS \"...I \nmaintain that \"A\" gives a cause and effect relationship (by virtue of \nthe phrase \"a consequence of \") between the pressure difference and the \ndownwash.  i.e pressure difference causes the acceleration of the \ndownwashed air. Something (a force) must accelerate that mass of air.  I \nprefer to make this distinction because it serves to support the \nuniversality of Newton's teachings.... However, \"B\" calls this the same \nforce when they are the two \"opposite and equal\" forces called out by what \nwe call Newton's Third law.  I don't consider them the same force, but \ncomponents of the whole explanation of lift. ...Analogy: I push myself up \nwith my foot on some sand on a dune and sand is pushed down - they act in \nopposite directions. ...To summarize lift,  \"stuff happens\" around wing \ncausing pressure difference which results in an upward force on the \nwing...this accellerates a mass of air downward which is from a force \ndownard.   If F=MA is indeed universal, then these must be two separate \nforces because they are causing two accelerations of two masses.  One is \ncountering the acceleratoin of gravity and the other accelerating a mas of \nair downward.. ...You may call that a preference, but keeping the forces \nseparate allows easier identification of the results of two of the parts ( \nlift and downwash) of the whole story. ...I can easily relate your \n\"microscopic scale\" to my \"stuff \"happening around the wing, and your \n\"macroscopic scale\" to Newton #3 which I like to refer to as  \"The \nPhenomenon of Paired Forces\"....and that they are both different, but \nimportant  parts of the entire story....Granted that without the first \nforce (me pusing on the sand) there is no second force (sand movement) , \nbut I think it is more instructive to talk about them as separate forces.  \n...Comments invited?-- ScienceAdviserStevehttp://www.challenger.org/ ",

In order for the air to \ncurve around the leading edge and uppper surface, a force must be exerted \non it. This force must be inward toward the wing to procude that \nacceleration.  ...Pressure differences are indeed the forces in a fluid \nthat cause acceleration.  Your characterization that: \"As the average speed \nof the particles increases, so more of them must be following the average \ndirection, with less jostling\"  is not consistent with Newton.  This \nis saying that the static pressure in a stream of air is lowered by virtue \nof its increased speed and this is simply not correct, makes on sense from \na Newtion point of view and can be measured as being the same. That is \nprecisely the Bernoulli misconception.   ...RE the leaf blower - Toilet \npaper demonstration is a demonstration of Entrainment. not the Bernoulli \nPrinciple myth. The increased speed out of a blower is caused by a HIGHER \npressure above atmospheric pressure INSIDE the blower.  That higher \npressure,  compared to atrmospheric pressure in the free air, is a net \nforce that 'pushes' the air out into the LOWER atmospheric pressure of free \nair.  Air moves from high pressure region to lower pressure region.   If \nthis was the case, then a stream of air would decrease in diameter as it \nflowed into the free air atmosphere, but instead it expamds....The \n\"jostling\" you refer to does not have some obsecure relation to linear \nmomentum as you appear to imply.  There is no reason a bunch of air in a \njar, a balloon, or just  traveling along by itself that was pushed rapidly \nthrough the air would have less pressure.  This sounds like the Science \nTheater explanation that the moving air  \"has *less time* to exert pressure \non the surrounding air\".  This is a myth that has been repeated over and \nover so many times that it has taken on a life of its own.  It is \nPathological Science (sick as in ill, not Steve Spangler 'sick', who BTW \nalso does not understand the real Bernoulli.). ...Please do yourself a \nfavor and read Weltner, The pressure of a fast stream of air injected into \nthe atmosphere is at *precisely the same pressure* as the air around \nit...

            "text": "There is a fundamental issue with this explanation and that is the \nassumption that the Bernoulli theorem (and it is simply a mathematical \nconstruct that describes a physical phenomenon) \"causes\" the lift.  No, it \ndoes not cause the lift.  In a dynamically closed system, a fluid moving \ninto a region of lower pressure must accelerate because it is moving down a \npressure gradient.  Thus, each fluid parcel is experiencing an unbalanced \nforce, but its resistance to that acceleration \"pushes back\" at the higher \npressure, maintaining that pressure gradient.  \n\nNow, when the air passes under the wing, the streamlines of fluid parcels \nare deflected downwards.  This is because the underside of the wing \ndirectly deflects the adjacent fluid parcels downward.  These exert a \npressure on incoming parcels that causes them to slow down (accelerate in a \nforward direction, or against the direction of flow).  Their resistance to \nthis acceleration generates the pressure gradient under the wing and the \npressure gradient generates the acceleration.  Reciprocal cause and effect. \n Most people can intuitively understand why the air passing under the wing \nmust be deflected downwards and why it must slow down.\n\nHowever, the \"cloud\" of increased pressure under the wing also extends \nslightly forward of the wing, as well.  Fluid parcels approaching the \nleading edge that are destined to pass over the wing are initially \ndeflected upwards by that \"cloud\" of increased pressure extending below and \nin front of the wing.  As they pass over the leading edge and top side of \nthe wing, the individual air molecules would continue in a straight line up \nand back, but air is a fluid and collisions between air molecules are \ncommon.  Thus, the air that has been deflected upwards is now being forced \nby the air above it to accelerate back downwards to follow the contour of \nthe upper surface of the wing.  That air's inertial resistance to that \ndownward acceleration causes it to form a \"bubble\" of low pressure above \nthe wing and that same \"bubble\" of low pressure causes the acceleration \nthat the air's inertia resists.  Again, reciprocal cause-and-effect.  \n\nThe Bernoulli theorem is a mathematical construct that describes the way \nthat fluid parcels must accelerate as they move from high to low pressure \n(and vice-versa), but it does not, in and of itself, explain *why*\ufeff",

Please note the careful analysis of the wind \ntunnel images and text on the 5 th page of this:\nhttp://219sqn.aafc.org.au/Flight/Simple%20Aerodynamics-How%20planes%20fly.pdf\n \n...\nThis *is* one of the better summary videos.\n...\nEveryone has their own pet aspect of this phenonomenon and puts all their \neggs in that one basket as though the other significant things (causes & \nphenomena) going on around the wing are minor, or irrelevant.\nYes, There is a difference in speeds between the air near top and bottom, \nand pressure differences and downwash as the result of the pressure \ndifferences and a very large mass of air above the wing contributes a great \ndeal to the downwash (which he also ignores).  However, all these are part \nof the explanation and without them all, one must simplify and summarize \nsomewhere...  and he does.\n...\nThe only error I see around 1:20, and already commented on, is that he \nenvokes Coanda, which is technically incorrect.   While similar, Coanda is \nin relation to high speed jets, or sheets of flow that are directed along a \nconvex surface, not the ordinary flow around a moving surface.  I believe \nBentley's above paper mentions that as well.  If that one doesn't, the most \nrecent one (2015 linked from his site) does.\n...\nHis comment around 2:00 that \"each explanation, if done correctly, \ncompletely  accounts for the lift\" is misleading because each explanation *as \ncommonly stated*, is incorrect and/or incomplete.  Each [Bernoulli's Law \nand Newton's Laws] must be applied at the correct points, and in correct \nCOMBINATION, to completely explain lift.  They actually are both required \naspects of a complete explanation.\n...\nLift is one of the subjects most dominated by the Dunning-Kruger effect\n...\nCheers, ScienceAdviserSteve\nhttp://www.challenger.org/ ",

Speed does \nnot cause lower pressure.  It is the other way around. A lower pressure in \none region is the cause of  air accelerating toward that region.  The \nupper, convex curve creates a lower pressure in a way your words are trying \nto explain, for sure.  To use words more like you are using:  The upper \nsurface curve's change in direction away from the airflow's original \ndirection creates a lower pressure region along the surface that causes the \nair to follow the curve  This is what Derek in the video calls Coanda, but \nis not what Coanda is considered to be.  Coanda has a very specific \ndescription requiring a *forced* stream of air.\n...\nMany also fail to consider that the lower pressure along the upper airfoil \nsurface has an effect on a considerable amount air further above the wing \nthat is also part of the air that is accelerated downward behind the wing.\nCheers",

            "text": "+corisco tupi +Gordon Freeman That's a bit rude corisco. He is however \nincorrect. Lift is actually the result of a force applied to anything to \nmake it rise. The exact explanation that causes an aircraft to fly is \nsomething like Derek spoke about in his video. When air hits the front of a \nwing it splits. The air just below the wing increases in pressure slightly \ndue to this split and the angle with which the wing is laid in comparison \nto direction of motion through the air. At the same time, the air above the \nwing is also being split which DOES increase the pressure above the wing \nslightly for a moment (at the very front of the wing) however since the \nwing is slightly angled upward, there is a pressure drop caused by the \ncavity formed from an essential plank cutting into the air. The space \nbehind this plane (the wing) is essentially devoid of air (not really) and \nso the air and the wing its-self want to rush into it. The air rushing into \nit is the cause of the low pressure. The wing wanting to rush into it is \nwhat produces *lift from a wing*. It infact wants to \"doubly\" rush into it \ndue to the high pressure below the wing.\n\nA Harrier jump jet can *produce lift* by directing its *thrust* downward.\n\nIt can also *produce lift* using it's conventional wings which require a \ncertain maintained velocity for sustained *flight*. The *thrust* on a \nHarrier can be used to main this velocity to allow for the wings to produce \nlift.\n\n(To be honest i'm not exactly correct here. Aircraft will actually not \ncontinue to rise at level flight. There is a balance between the force of \ngravity and the lift produced by the wing at level flight. However, once \nyou angle the wing into the air more vertically you can infact produce more \nlift but this isn't essentially how aircraft climb either. An aircraft \nactually climbs in altitude by firstly maintaining its angle of attack or \npitch entirely by the stability caused by the wing in the first place and \nsecondly by the thrust of the aircraft now being vectored at an angle \npushing the aircraft along this angled \"line\" higher. However even if you \ncut the engines on an aircraft it may still climb at the cost of its \nairspeed. For example, at a 45 degree angle an aircraft that has been \nclimbing which suddenly cuts its engines will lose airspeed rather quickly \ndue to gravity and drag (some of this drag is directly converted into \nflight stability). It will however continue to climb on that angle so long \nas the wings have airspeed giving it \"flight stability\". Once the aircraft \ndrops below this speed, the wings will no longer be effective and the \naircraft will begin to fall like a big flat rock. (Horizontal stabilizers, \nmore accurately known as a tailplane [or lateral neck plane] can be \ncorrectly used to constantly provide the accurate type of force required to \nturn a falling rock into a flying aircraft once again. Most aircraft are \ndesigned front heavy so that they resultantly fall nose down resulting in \neffective airspeed at the wings, resulting in stability which can then \ncause effective usage of tail or neck planes to slowly convert the \naircrafts flight path to something horizontal once again)",

Bernoulli's principle never says why the \nair speeds up, just that it does so with an associated decrease in \npressure. In the case of a wing, the air speeds up because it in a sense \npasses through a restriction created by the camber of the wing, like in a \nventuri. Visualized two dimensionally, the camber of the wing forms the \nbottom of the restriction, and the airflow not affected by the wing forms \nthe top. This explains why a cambered wing creates lift even at zero angle \nof attack. In fact, camber has such a profound effect on the performance of \na wing, that certain extremely thick and highly cambered wings can offset \nsome of their induced drag by creating a lift vector angled towards the \ndirection of flight.\n\nI also feel that the video oversimplifies what happens when the angle of \nattack increases, only addressing the increase in Newtonian lift, the \ndownward deflection of air. Increasing the angle of attack also decreases \nthe size of the theoretical restriction, thus speeding up the airflow over \nthe top of the wing. This explains how a flat wing like the Wright \nBrothers' was able to fly. Camber is not needed to induce Bernoullian lift \nwhen the angle of attack is anything but zero.\n\nOverall I think that this explanation is pointed in the right direction, \nbut it's still inadequate to the point that it unfortunately further \ncontributes to an improper understanding of lift. It correctly addresses \nthe misconception that two air-streams separated at the leading edge must \nmeet at the trailing edge, and it introduces little known Newtonian lift, \nbut it really is a vast oversimplification and gross under-explanation of \nthe contributions of Bernoullian lift. Yes they both exist in wing \naerodynamics and are complexly interrelated, but they don't explain the \nsame thing.\ufeff",

The canard configuration is actually more \nefficient as airplanes with this configuration need less wing area (hence \nless drag) to lift the same weight at the same speed. To be totally fair \nthough, in your Concorde example, those are not true canards but nose \nstrakes. Contrary to canards, they have no direct contribution to \nlongitudinal stability. They are placed to control flow at specific \nairplane parts in high angles of attack and are usually not part of the \noriginal design, being added later usually during flight testing. \nInterestingly, one of Concorde's early design configurations (Bristol 198, \nlater dropped in favor of the shape we have come to know) was a true canard \ndesign.",

Aircraft have their center of gravity ahead (more \nforward) than the center of lift, making them nose-heavy. Horizontal \nstabilizers produce negative lift pushing the tail down (nose up). The \nbeauty of this setup is that it is naturally self-stabilizing: any \n decrease in airspeed will make the stabilizer produce less negative lift, \nallowing the nose to drop, which increases speed again. Conversely, an \nincrease in speed will increase the downforce on the stabilizer pulling the \nnose up, thus reducing speed. This is why airplanes fly hands-off at \nconstant airspeed - the airplane is always actively seeking to fly at  the \ntrimmed airspeed by its own, regardless of pilot input. *That* is what the \n\"lateral wings\" (horizontal stabilizers) are for.",
