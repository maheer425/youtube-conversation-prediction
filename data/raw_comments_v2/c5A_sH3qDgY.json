The survivors are. I think that put an overall pressure on sick \npeople because culture says if you are sick and you got better, you are a \nhero, and if you are sick and you don't get better, you failed. I just \nthink the culture where sick people are suddenly warriors is a very \ninteresting one because the people working to stop it from getting worse \nare not generally considered the heroes.\ufeff",

So what you are \nsaying John is that no matter what we do we can't stop the spread of Ebola. \nFair enough and probably true. Can we lessen the spread of Ebola by using \nmandatory quarantine? It seems to me that we could certainly do that. \nDoctors and nurses have already been infected, and afterward have made bad \ndecisions that could make the crisis even worse. If these professionals are \nunable to protect themselves, and unable to identify the risk they may \nrepresent to their family and friends (and the general population of earth) \nthen maybe a mandatory quarantine is the best course of action. I don't \nunderstand the outrage some folks have about being quarantined. I certainly \ndon't want to discourage doctors and nurses from helping those in need, but \nin cases like this it seems the prudent course of action is to be a little \ninconvenienced for a short amount of time. I guess in my simple mind it is \nlike wearing a seat belt. I rarely need it but I use it just in case.\ufeff",
