This causes ingrowing claws. So if you trim, you \nMUST carry on trimming and inspect each claw every time you trim to make \nsure the underside is clear (you can scratch it off when it's still soft) \nand that the outer dead layer is removed. \nI took on a 9 year old cat whose claws were trimmed before, it took him a \nmonth or so to retract his claws fully and walk on carpet without snagging. \nI still check his claws and sure enough that soft stuff underneath needs \nscratching off every now and again. My other cat is also a rescue, 3 years \nyounger and totally traumatised, non-handle cat (fine with stroking but \ncannot be restrained at all)\nBetween the two of them I have been scratched twice in two years, both \naccidental. \nMy furniture is immaculate and I have told one once and the other 4 times - \nyes, in 2 years - never yelled, just said quietly no. They have 2 cat trees \nand 2 stand alone posts plus a cardboard scratcher, in an apartment less \nthan 50 square metres. I don't pick them up and move them, no sprays, no \nyelling, nothing. I just treat them right and respect their felinity. I \nsolve problems, I don't try to change the cat. The whole room is arranged \nso they can gt right around without touching the floor. The couch has a \nsheet over it and over the front to the floor and that's a den. \nThink cat!\ufeff",

They recover quickly, walk normally, continue to stretch \nusing their \"pads\" as if they had claws, and some can even still climb \ntrees since they mostly use hind claws to do this (although keeping them \nindoors will keep any cat alive a lot longer for many reasons). Cats \npractically never get arthritis, and when they do it is mostly in their \nhind legs, which are never declawed. I am not even going to try to convince \nyou because you are so fixed in your beliefs, but either YOUR information \nsource is biased/flawed, or you selectively remember what you need in order \nto try to convince other people of your immutable beliefs. \n\nOf course all alternatives should be tried first.

Cats walk on the tips of their \ntoes, when the tips are amputated, it changes how they walk, which leads to \nstress on the joints of the foot/leg/shoulder & back and this causes \narthritis, an inflammation of these joints. Research shows increased \nchanges to cats behaviour post declawing: without their claws the will turn \nto biting as a defense mechanism, they can return home from the vet & not \nbe able to tolerate the texture of the litter leading to urination outside \nthe litter box. IF you have a cat, you NEED to EXPECT that they NEED places \nto SCRATCH. IF you VALUE your FURNITURE above your CAT, DO NOT BRING a cat \ninto your home.

For physical contact, I \nwould be very still and pat her softly around the ears and neck, just \nenough, and stop when she begins to show irritation. A really fun way to \nplay with your cat, and one she might like better, is to dangle something \nonto the floor, either a string, or something tied to a string, or \nsomething like that cat toy called \"Da Bird.\" It looks like a fishing rod \nand line, and it has a fancy feathery bird at the end of the line, and you \nwiggle it on the floor so it looks (to the cat) like a bird walking along \nthe ground, or make it wiggle on the floor like wounded bird. Then the cat \nwill get its hopes up that there is a meal coming up, and will start \ncreeping up on the bird, and when it gets closer, you lift the bird off the \nfloor and make it fly around all over the place. You can even run around \nthe house with it. Make sure you don't get the bird out of sight of the \ncat. Then you can let the bird slow down and land on the floor, and wiggle \naround, and watch the cat start getting ready to attack again, Once in a \nwhile, you let the cat catch the bird. Jackson Galaxy says \"BE the bird!!\" \nas you are controlling the bird in the air. This is really fun, when in \nyour imagination, you pretend you are the bird, flying around escaping from \nthe cat.  The cat does not care that she can't eat this bird, because she \nwill have plenty of cat food to eat in your house, but cats love to hunt \nand catch. It's a very strong instinct in cats. When Jackson Galaxy says \n\"Play with your cat,\" he means for you to do this getting the cat to hunt, \nstalk, pounce, capture, all with stuff at the ends of strings.  Then of \ncourse there are toys that run by themselves that cats can play with. They \nget excited by a wiggling toy.  A toy mouse can lie on the floor forever \nand the cat will ignore it, but as soon as you wiggle it, the cat's hunting \ninstincts wake up.  I have a  hunch that your cat may bite you because \nhe/she gets into the mood that you, your hand or arm or whatever you are \nmoving is prey. So of course it's going to bite!!  And then it draws blood! \nNow you smell and taste like prey!! Be glad your cat is not as big as a \ntiger!!  Haha! \nSo, I think if you abandon (leave behind) the idea of playing with your cat \nwith your hand and your physical body in any way, and just play in this \nother way with soft toys on strings, you both will have more fun and you \nwon't get hurt.  I like to put just a string with a little something soft \ntied to it, on the floor, and then try to make it wiggle as realistically \nas I can, so it really looks like a little mouse or bird. Really, watching \nthem play like that is so much fun!!  They get into so many funny positions \nleaping around in the air!

            "text": "+Amber Barton I'm glad to read about how much you like cats and appreciate \nthem so much. I used to be a dog person, too. In fact, I just became a cat \nperson!!  But I don't agree with some of the generalizations you make about \ndogs and the differences between cats and dogs and the reasons cats are \n\"better\" connected with their genetics. For example, it is hard wired into \ndogs to be domesticated, and that is hardwired into cats, as well. \nOtherwise, they would be just like small lions and tigers, which they are \nnot!  The biggest difference in the behavior of cats and dogs in famillies \nis that wolves (ancestors of dogs) lived and hunted in packs, so they HAD \nto be more cooperative with each other. Felines are solitary hunters \n(except for lions in a pride.) You can tell they are used to living around \nother felines because they are so territorial with each other. I'd say cats \ntend to like each other, but only if they respect each other's territories. \n( I learned something from \"My Cat From Hell\" recently. He came into a home \nin which one cat was dominating the other cat like crazy and the victim cat \nwas peeing all over the floor and hiding the rest of the time. Jackson \ndidn't do anything with the aggressive cat. He did a serious of things with \nthe victim cat to turn him into a \"confident cat\" and then, as a \"confident \ncat,\" he stood up for himself with the aggressive cat, and territory got \nbalanced, and the victim cat completely stopped peeing on the floor! I was \nreally surprised that it was not a matter of re-training the aggressive \ncat. It was funny, too. The aggressive cat was this pale long-haired sweet \nlooking ball of fluff. The victim cat was a large sleek black and white \ncat!!\n\n I think it would be interesting if someone did a study on the differences \nin personality between dog people and cat people, as you mentioned that you \ndo see a difference.  I think cat people can recognize their cat's \nindividuality and how it makes choices\u2014and, after all, being so small, they \nare more sensitive and can't take as much roughousing (well, small dogs are \nmore sensitive, too, aren't they?) and dog people when they see that, think \nthat the cat doesn't care about the person and it is aloof.\n\nI prefer it when people don't say that cats are better than dogs or dogs \nare better than cats. I think it totally depends on the preference of the \nowner. Also, another important thing that makes a difference is whether a \ndog or a cat was abused when young. Just like with people, it's very hard \nto get beyond that suspiciousness and lack of trust which they learned from \nbeing abused.\n\nHere's something we could notice here online, on cat or dog discussions. \nWhich people tend to post angrier posts, cat people or dog people.  Did you \never notice? I didn't\u2014I just know there's a lot of unnecessary anger \nbetween people with different tastes.  And the reason I thought of that, is \nthat I think these extremely angry people were abused as children. Maybe \nnot physically abused, but a lot of disapproval and criticism.",

Cats take time to grow to you, they need to \nlearn to trust you, and develop a relationship over time and dogs are just \nimmediately and blindly loyal and needy and have to be taught everything. \n Cat people value that animal's individuality and independence and respect \nit as they do their owners and it transcends into life where they value \nrelationships that take time and trust to develop instead of blindly \ntrusting whoever they meet like dog people tend to do.  This is just from \nwhat I personally have seen and experienced in my life from being a dog \nperson as a child and then a cat person at the current place in my life now \nand I see it a lot in people who are cat/dog people.  Dog people tend to \nlike being depended on hence why they like dogs.  Dogs need that constant \nguidance and attention and someone who's going to lead them because they \nlack independence and they lack their own ability to realize right from \nwrong.  I just prefer how cats are more intelligent and have vast and \ncomplex personalities and take time to love you because that time you spend \nand let grow with the cat is so worth it in the end.  More loyal than any \ndog because they take the time to get to know you as well.",
