When I got my Cockatoo (Lily)  the owner said she had \njust started pulling feathers, she wasn't quite as bad as this parrot but \nwe got her to the vet and she gave us medicine to relax her nerves (kind of \na xanax for parrots) it worked.  Time spent loving on her, the meds and \ngood food, her feathers all came back. (My Lily unfortunately passed away \nfrom a heart attack-something scared her in the night while she was in her \ncage). One day I will have another one, they are demanding parrots but the \nrewards of love and time with them are priceless.)  My Grey (Benji) is 28 \nyears old and talks up a storm. Love my feathered buddy.  He does however \nscream or make very loud noises on occasion, I have used the blanket over \nhis cage and tell him NO when he does this and it does work, when they get \nquiet remove the blanket, they will learn to associate the blanket with \nsomething that you don't like and will learn to not do it as often. Hope \nthis helps some of you with your babies.\ufeff",

I have 3 parrets and one was a rescue that needed to stop \npulling fethers and one other was given to my aunt who also started pulling \nand both cases a spray of that poison stuff wouldn't work and you can tell \nshe still has it going on a bird malts or loses its fethers every 3 years \nso you would have the baby fethers back to replace in a mounth to a couple \nof mounths. how you fix the pulling of fethers is spray them and encourage \nbath times atleast 1 to 2 times a week and make sure the bird is \ncomfortable with where you are at before flalling your arms everywhere like \nshe was and a spray to let them know that pulling is bad. now look anywhere \nyou will find that bigger birds such as parrets macaws and cocatoos are the \nsmarter of birds but can be more stuberns, that being said merlin that \naffrican gray timna knew the word bad and what it ment as well as my sister \nat the stove ment fire alarm and getting rdy 4 work she would say go to \nwork mom and 4 me I gotta go to work and he was and still is trained to ask \nfor food by saying im hungery. \"just never pull out the peanut butter \nwithout telling her no or in a minuate\" she know those too and for how \nstubern they are merlin was told bad and he would stop screaming but the \namazon is more stubern. you stop the screaming by covering them and a word \nlike bad to later relate to \"if they want\" the amazon we have will just \nlater on tell on me and say to my mother \"bad bad\". but part of not all of \nbut part is the inconsistancy the bird is smart but should relate to the \nsame words from everyone\ufeff",
