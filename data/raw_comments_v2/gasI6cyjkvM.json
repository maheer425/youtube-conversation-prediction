If you're not a huge \nparty-person, you won't magically transform into to one just by going \nthere. \n\nIf you're not that into gambling, there are still great shows to see or \nother activities outside. First time I was there I took one of those \nhelicopter tours into the Grand Canyon. They land right before sunset and \nflies you back and over the strip when it's dark so you can see all the \nlights from the sky. Expensive (about 300 dollars), but totally worth it.\n\nYou can also rent sports cars for a decent price and cruise around on the \nlong desert roads.
