It had the standard 318, and it had been fitted with \nAmerican racing 5 spoke mags that really sported it up. I ran Good Year \nPower Cushion Polys all the way around, because the original  dual stripe \nwhite wall rubber was toast.  (Car had 89000 on it.)   The only other thing \nI did which enhanced the appearance was to use air shocks in the back to \ncant the angle up about 3 inches  so that it wasn't a tail dragger. My car \nwas with the stock deep dark blue enamel, that was a baked finish, and it \nglistened really well with Rain Dance polishing. It was much prettier than \nthe red shown here, way more depth in the finish, much like clear coat.   \n\nThe weirdest thing about the car was the rear window deck speaker system. \nIt had the deluxe set up with 3 6x9  ovals with aluminum covers. The center \nwas channeled through a reverb unit (mounted in the trunk)  with a rheostat \non under the left corner of the dash which adjusted the effect.
