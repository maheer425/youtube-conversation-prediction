You're \ngoing to be jumping around and grinding against strangers and it's very hot \n(not in a sexy way) and you do not want to have a jacket on. \n2. Don't be afraid to mosh! As he said in he video, mosh pits are \nsurprisingly safe! I've seen an entire mosh pit stop because one person \nfell over before, . And even if it doesn't completely stop someone will \nhelp you up. And afterwards you'll be thankful you did it.\n3. Glasses, no. Wear contacts if possible.\n4. Pee before the show starts. For the love of god, pee before the show \nstarts. \n5. Get as much rest as possible before the concert. Sleepy concerts are the \nworst. \n6. (And as the person with the worst immune system in existence this is \nimportant to me) If you're sick but still want to go to the show try to \ntake antibiotics and eat healthy before the show. I had a terrible double \neat infection before what I was sure would be the best concert I ever went \nto so I loaded up on pain meds and ear drops before have. It was a smaller \nvenue and I'm a minor so they didn't check my bags, but all the large \nvenues do. They should let you keep the stuff if you tell them you're sick. \nJust in case though take whatever antibiotics holy need before the show and \nchug herbal teas (see #4) or whatever. \nGood luck, and have fun!\ufeff",

(The 3rd is a fairly \nnew obsession who hasn't been to metro Detroit since the obsession started) \nI've stopped going to BNL shows because they are not the same without \nSteven Page :( but I still see Domestic Problems usually a couple times a \nyear, at least. With all these concerts under my belt, im still a nervous \nwreck until im there, standing in MY spot. I want to be standing there when \nthe doors open, since most of their shows do not have seating, and I must \nbe standing down front for their shows! Its folk/pop rock so, NO moshpits \nto worry about. Thank goodness! But water, comfortable shoes and shorts and \nsleeveless shirts are a MUST for me! Otherwise, its WAY too hot. There is a \nlot of dancing and crowd participation that can wear you out, especially \nwhen you're around 45 years old! ;) \nOver the years, I've met all the band members and most of their wives and \nthey are the nicest guys. In Detroit and Grand Rapids, they look for me, my \nhusband and my daughter down front and we're always there!! #GoodTimes\nThanks for letting me tell my story, Hank!

            "text": "I will argue that the \"don't move ahead of people\" rule must be broken at \nhard-rock concerts...\n\nI have mixed feelings about moving past people in the crowd. Normally this \nsort of behavior is absolutely inconsiderate. For example, last minute \nmerging in traffic sometimes justifies vigilante justice, perhaps even \nstern looks of disapproval.\n\nHowever, exceptions must be made for rowdy concerts.\n\nRegular rockers know that there's a gradient of rowdiness, which is \ninversely related to personal space. The closer you are to the front, the \nrougher it gets. Personally I like to go wild, mosh, jump around, scream, \netc. Leaving with injuries is par for the course. Your position in the \ncrowd is based on how physical you are willing to be.\n\nOperating this way creates an unpleasant environment for those in the crowd \nwho aren't prepared to rough-house. Still, those of us who came to roar and \ngo crazy NEED that outlet.\n\nIt's unfair to expect the animals in the crowd to remain calm so everyone \ncan watch the show in relative peace, and positioned in the order they've \narrived. If you're not happy with that dynamic, then perhaps general \nadmission hard-rock shows just aren't your thing. Also, there are often \nbalconies for the less crazy fans.\n\nAdditionally, I second that people are extremely considerate of others' \nwell-being at even the roughest concerts. Despite what it may look like, no \none wants to hurt people, or make them feel unsafe. Except maybe that one \nguy... but we all hate that guy.\n\nNever feel weird about asking someone for help if you're feeling \nuncomfortable or unsafe! You'll find the very roughians responsible for \nmaking you feel that way will happily take a break to help you muscle your \nway to solid ground... then muscle their way back to the pit.\ufeff",
