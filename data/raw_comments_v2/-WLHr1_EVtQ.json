The second time he shows a \nword and we can tell from context that it is Portuguese and everybody \npronounces it correctly.\nHe kind of laughs it off but it kind of disproves his point. The foreign \nalphabet isn't useless and if you want to learn a language you're going to \nhave to use it a some point.

Ask most native speakers and \nyou'll know most of them don't have any idea about how their language \nworks, but they can still speak it flawlessly because they've learned all \nthe rules subconsciously. You don't need to be aware of all the sentence \nstructures, tenses and conjugations, you just need to know how to apply \nthem and the method showed in the video provides a good technique to do so.",
