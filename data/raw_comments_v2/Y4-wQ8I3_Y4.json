It wouldn't be cute to me being on a date with someone and their pants \nfalling off. I wouldn't have gone on a date with a person who looked like \nthat in the first place. I really don't mean to be mean but do you think \nthis is professional looking?  You're having to reach down all the time to \nkeep your pants up. It's just so silly to see a grown man do this. How do \nyou explain this fashion to children? \"I want sex so I wear pants that slip \ndown so my underwear can be seen. Women really go for that.\" Try explaining \nthat to your children some day. A player that lets his pants fall off is \nabout as smart as cutting the zipper off your pants and letting your boxers \nbeen seen. PLUS you could cut holes in your shirt where your nipples are. \nMakes about as much sense.\ufeff",
