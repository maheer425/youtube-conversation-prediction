How do we let law get away with this?\n\n- Vast majority of people behind bars are non-violent offenders.\n\n- We pay for their accommodation through tax even though most are perfectly \nsafe in the real world and productive for the economy if they're free to \nbuy goods and get jobs.\n\n- So many non-violent citizens are locked away whilst those with money or \npolitical influence get away with the most fucked up things. And police \nbrutality too!\n\n- Their prison sentence has stigma enough they struggle to get a job even \nafter prison, having to get tax benefits and many turn to stealing. We make \nit worse for them and their criminal mistakes by making it even harder for \nthem after a prison sentence than before it, and making crimes like \nstealing even more appealing.\n\n- You are far more likely to be arrested simply by being black...  or \nmale...  what the fuck.\n\n- The Halo Effect is a very well documented bias in court ruling. Simply \nput, the less attractive you naturally are (Balding, Acne, skin conditions \nand other things you may not be able to help...)  the much more likely \nyou'll be found guilty of a crime regardless of the evidence.\n\n- Prisons profit off the arrest and containment of other people. It's a \nfriggin' for-profit business!  Is it just me or is that not fucked up on \nits own?\n\n- Rehabilitation schemes / community service is increasing unpopular in \nfavour of just locking them away, punishing them and not addressing their \nroot crime / problems.\n\n- A significant percentage of people locked away are eventually found \nnot-guilty, and theoretically many who remain guilty may not actually be \nguilty for their crimes. This includes those on Death Row.\n\n- Oh, that's another point...   THE FUCKING DEATH PENALTY STILL EXISTS! \n ARE WE FUCKING BABARIC!?\n\nFUCKED. UP. WORLD.\n\n.\ufeff",
