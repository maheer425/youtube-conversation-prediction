            "text": "Ok so after fiddling with this trick i've finally figured out how to do it \ncorrectly but it requires for you to not just arrange the cards but count \nthem out differently. All the numbers work in threes and each of these has \na special way in which you have to draw them when you present the card to \nyour viewer. So 1,2,3 is 000,001,002. With 0 being top,1 middle and 2 \nbottom. 4,5,6 is 010,011,012 so you can see the pattern, the first number \nin a sequence always goes to the top the last time you deal the cards. \nWhich means when you present the card you draw cards from the face down \ntop, when it's the third number in a sequence it always ends on the bottom \nwhich means when you present the card you draw them from the face up top ah \nbut then come the middle numbers which always end up in the middle. No \nfriggin way are they going to be anywhere in the first 9 cards from top or \nbottom. So what then? When you put them together ask your friend to state \nhis number again, while you shave off the first 8 cards from the face up \ntop. Then count your cards :D. Hope this helps.\ufeff",

            "text": "I learned a really cool card trick in math class. It's easy to do, no magic \nor math required. How it works? I have no idea but I know how to do it.\n\nSo take a deck of cards and have someone pick out 3 cards, make sure they \nremember so have them write it down or ask 3 people to pick one card each. \nHave them hold their 3 cards while you shuffle the deck. Then you're going \nto make 3 piles of cards. The first pile you put 10 cards down then to the \nright of that pile put 15 cards down then the third pile next to that will \nbe 15 again. So you have 10-15-15 they are holding 3 cards and that leaves \nyou with a pile of 9 cards, put those 9 cards off to the side. Try not to \ncount out loud while making these piles. Just for easy reference 1st=10 \nleft / 2nd = middle 15 / 3rd = right 15\n\nHave them put down 1 of their cards on the 1st pile (10) then tell them to \ncut the 2nd pile (15) *ANYWAY* they want. They could take one card and put \nit on top of the 1st pile, they can take all but one card. Even or odd \nnumber of cards they cut it doesn't matter. Then have them put the second \ncard on the 2nd pile ( the one they just cut) and tell them to cut the 3rd \npile (15) again anyway they want and put it on top of 2nd pile. That leaves \nus with the 3rd pile where the third card will go, now take that extra 9 \ncards and put that on top the third pile so now all the cards are in 3 \npiles. Pick them up from right to left! 3rd pile on top of 2nd pile and \nthose piles on top of 1st pile. Meaning the 3rd pile is on top 1st is on \nbottom. *Our deck is almost ready but this is important, take the first 4 \ncards off the top of the deck and put them on the bottom*\n\nNow here's where the magic... or math happens. Tell them you're going to \nmake two piles one pile face up and the other face down. Tell them to say \nstop if they see their card. So go through the whole deck starting with \nface up! So face up, face down, face up, face down. When you get through \nthe first time you're going to take the pile of face up cards and put them \noff to the side. Now take the cards you put face down and do it again. Face \nup, face down, face up, face down all through the deck. Keep doing this \nover and over, you'll eventually be left with only 3 cards. Flip those 3 \ncards up and abracadabra you will have their 3 cards. And it will always be \nthe cards they choose. However if you start with face down it won't work, \nforget to take 4 cards off the top before flipping it won't work or if you \nmix up the piles or a card gets out of place it won't work so keep the \npiles neat and tidy.\ufeff",
