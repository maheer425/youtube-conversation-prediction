The effect was about a 5% drop in grades, I \nwas pretty relaxed about this given that I was taking university level \ncourses. \n\n\nHowever after the first month in AP generally about 1/3-1/2 of all students \ndropped out, not due to failing a test/homework but because anything less \nthan 80% was considered a serious liability. The more ambitious choice \nuniversity the more likely students were to take classes to the tune of \nexact requirements, often meaning only 5 classes and all at basic level.\n\n\nBeyond the absurdity of undercutting education so as to get students into \nuniversity there is also no benefit.

            "text": "It is because they want to remake American into a theocratic state, and one \nassumes a \"Christian nation\" which is counter to the founders. If the \nfounders wanted that they'd simply have had for the first Ammendment: \n\"Freedom of Judeo-Christian Denomination\".  One assumes these Christian \nideologues have some place for Jews, as Christian Europe did and one \nassumes they have a place for Catholics, otherwise they would have just put \n\"Freedom of Protestant Faith\" or some other limited term like that. But \nwhat did they write: \"Freedom of Religion\". I know its hard to believe but \nthe founders in fact knew of Eastern religions and Islam and Esoteric \nChristianity and in fact, many were esoteric, Deists, free masons, etc. So \nit is utterly false that this is a Christian nation or a theocratic state.\n\nThe other reason why they want to only teach Math, English, and one assumes \nAlgebra, Geometry, Reading, English II, English III, and other tests. \nBasically they want to streamline school so they teach what narrowly is \ntested, and since the school is graded on delivering test scores in Math \nand English that is what the focus is on. Those scores = money for the \ndistrict.\n\nSo from a secular point of view, we have a narrow focus of school as a \nfocus on teaching kids basic academic skills and demonstrating that in \nstandardized test and schools wanting to drop all else. This kills any real \nsense of school as 'classic education' and really just as an industrial \neducation. That is in fact the model used. It comes from Germany and came \nto the US around the turn of the 20th century (ie. the 1900's for those \nboneheads in school now who don't know that).\n\nThat means from two sides the schools are assaulted: one from the religious \nand its ideology and one from the secular and its industrial method of \nideology. In the middle are people like the Koch brothers who are simply \nmodern day versions of the same groups and industrialists who sought to \ncontrol public education and do so for their own personal and mostly \neconomic agendas. In fact, every time you see those news articles on Yahoo \nabout something a teacher did or said is designed to box in education as a \nwhole and is essentially saying 'something is wrong and it needs to be \nfixed' and when the voters (parents) then vote and give a mandate the \n'solution' is going to also have other more insidious elements that \nfundamentally change the character of education, and that is what you are \nseeing now when efforts to cut social studies and science.\n\nBeyond that you also need to look at the other side of education: private, \nand charter (which is sort of public and private) and higher education. You \nsee once you graduate high school which is based on the industrial model, \nand students are socially promoted all the time they must then pay for \nknowledge, and that is big business. When you go to a job fair you find \nhalf of the people there are schools and programs that say pick a job and \nthis is the program you need to qualify, or to gain that needed certificate \nor license. Real professions are locked up and limited via such license \nsystems, like the guilds of Medieval times. That is why most real skills, \nmost real things of value to an employer are NOT taught at school. Sure you \ncan find some stuff, like the occasional cool desktop publishing class, and \nsome districts in fact do teach things but that is yet another side of \nthis? The Haves and Have Notes. Some communities and their kids are the \nhaves and they have high schools that have technical centers and get all \nmanner of classes like learning Chinese or Japanese, Russian History, \nRobotics, Guitar or some other very specific class and get a full measure \nof a broad education, and then there are the other have not schools. They \nhave not the funds nor resources needed for these things and when someone \nin those district tries, someone actively kills that effort quick because \nthey know good ideas if allowed to flourish are hard to kill later. That is \nthe reality of American education. That is why if you do live in a  have \nnot place, home school your kid so they don't have to sit in class with \nkids allowed to disrupt and effectively kill any real learning. People have \nthe right to education, but not the right to stifle the education of \nothers. I've worked in many schools and some are great, some are not and I \nwould not let my son or daughter go to the one I know is dysfunctional.\n\nThey'd get much more just sitting at home doing home schooling. Not because \nI want to protect them ideologically, but to protect them from the culture \nof dumb-asses that populate such schools as the lowest common denominator \nin such schools ultimately is allowed to rule the roost. The school might \nhave dedicated teachers here and there, but they just like the dedicated \nstudents fight against the very system they are stuck in and against the \nmajority of students who simply don't care about education. That is the \nopposite of education and I would not inflict it on a kid who really does \nwant to learn. They are allowed to be like that because it serves someones \nagenda and political (and economic) interest. Trust me, if the powers that \nbe really don't want the ignorant to 'get away with it' they really know \nhow to do so. So if your one of those kids, you really are not getting away \nwith anything other than what someone very smart who is benefiting wants \nyou to get away with. They get paid for you thinking you are smart by \ngetting away with not developing as a person and disrupting class. Nope, \nyour a resource, a chattel  that is making them money, a modern form of \nslave. You are not even aware that you are as your free to come and go, but \ntry and NOT go to school and see what happens. You'll discover your not as \nfree as you really think.\n\nPersonally I feel that is the case because they want dysfunctional adults, \nsince you developed in your 'education' a false sense of reality. When you \ndo those same things later on, and when your older, they will only be \nself-destruction and work against you. You will only end up providing \nsomeone with some form of benefit from your dysfunction. You got a ticket \nand did not pay it? Now you must pay more, and you didn't do that either? \nSomeone will get paid 200+ dollars a day because you got arrested. Your \ndysfunction is big money. You learned your 'free' to be a dumb-ass and \nirresponsible in school, and for that you got a big reality check. Yup, \nyour welcome.\ufeff",
