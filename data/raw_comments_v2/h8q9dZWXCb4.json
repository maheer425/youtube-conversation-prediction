Is this because of the Indian climate (it's warm and very \nhumid), or do I need to temper the compound chocolate? \nPlease help.

If you use a THICK ziplock bag (if its too thin it will \nmelt the bag.) and microwave water for 2 minutes, set the bag inside the \nwater and wait for the chocolate to melt! no chance of burning or cooking \ntoo long. Just be sure the bag is sealed right and take some of the air out \nwhen it is half melted for better results and faster melting. dry the bag \nbefore using and cutting the tip.
