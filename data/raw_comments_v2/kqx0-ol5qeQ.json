You creationists and Christians like to cherry pick the \nparts that you consider \"good\" in the bible. I'm the opposite. I cherry \npick the bad shit like how you faggots need to be stoned and burned and \nmurdered for being faggots. Fuck you. But I'm also a satanist so I believe \nin Stalin and like to fuck hookers while I pray to lucifer to fuck your \nfaggot asses with molten metal for ETERNITY. Yeah but God is lame shit so I \ncherry pick to not believe that part except where God made lucifer and \nkilled everyone in Sodom and Gomorrah (Hepatitis 6:9) and then told \neverybody to suck my cock cuz they've all sinned anyways. \"Thy shalt suck \nthy neighbor's cocketh with love as thy give unto me for my great powers. \nLet Jesus be proof that acceptance and forgiveness be made only by sucking \nthy neighbor's blasphemous cock and let that be a testament to your faith \nto me residing above lucifer (Corinthians 11:6-12:1, 4:2-6:9). \n\nSo please all you just kindly suck my cock. My opinion is obviously right.",
