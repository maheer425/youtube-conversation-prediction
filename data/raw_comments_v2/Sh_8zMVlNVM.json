Being \nretired military with 6 deployments and a lot of time lost building the \nbond that holds families together with my own sons, I understand how Brian \ncould never part with this car. It's not about money. There's more to the \nstory. Let's talk about being \"born\" into the racing world with this car. \nMy sons always talk about my old mustang. It's a 95 Cobra, supercharged, \nand 500 hp to the wheels. It was a joy to put them on my lap and ride \naround the block. They loved it and still talk about it to this day. It was \nthe only thing that we had in common for years. Now they're older and the \nmost interesting thing came up just the other day. Now they want to start a \nbuild with dear old Dad (of course I have to foot the bill, they're still \nteens). They want another mustang, but they want me to race it. Sooooo \nafter watching this video, you should understand what the real story is. \nFamily is the only important thing in this story. If you disagree, I'm \nliterally praying for you because you have totally lost sight of what the \npoint of this video is.\ufeff",
