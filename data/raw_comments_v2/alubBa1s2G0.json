The \nperson(whom you should trust) will do a series of weird things while you \nstill keep your eyes closed. They will first clap in front of your face 10 \ntimes, snap at each ear alternating times(5 each ear), and finally move \nyour arms together and cross them 10 times like each arm should be on top 5 \ntimes. The person should then tell you to count to ten in your head and you \nsay when you're done. Do that counting down from 10, 8,6,4,2,1. Finally \nstand back and the person should tell you to say the phrase \" deadman \ndeadman take me to my grave \" over and over. You should feel your hands \nrise like a zombie\ufeff",

I searched a lot online and stuff, here's what \nI got: \n\nThe reason why our fingers always 'hug' each other is because our fingers \nare usually curled up most of the time, every single day, in every single \nhour, every single minute, and every single second. (You get it already) \nEven when you think our fingers are straight, they are actually not. Put \nyour finger \"straight\" and examine it. You can see a curve along on the \nknuckles, it's not straight at all. Our fingers were made to curl up. You \ncan even notice this while doing regular activities thru out the day. I \nalways see my fingers curl while reading an book, playing games, or even \nholding something.\nI also took another examine, I did the trick that was in this video but \nwithout someone tying it and without thinking of anything being tied. I put \none of my favorite songs on, that didn't worked, I couldn't resist thinking \nabout someone tying my fingers together. \nSo my mother came in my room while I was doing this trick, she talked about \nsome thing, and I was focused on what she said and not on my project, and \nguess what, my fingers had touched each other. It's basically just our \nfingers curling up, that's all.\n\nNote: This isn't really what I exactly put on my project, I just added a \nfew touches. I also got an A, from this (real) scientist, he said this \nstudy was really acceptable and he agrees with my report.\ufeff",
