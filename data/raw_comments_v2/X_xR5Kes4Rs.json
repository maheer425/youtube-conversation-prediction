Invention are our way of manipulating \nthe nature around us. We didn't invent air, but we built something that \ncould work with it to fly. We didn't invent the atom, but we can make \ncompounds using the properties of atoms. Inventions use the properties of \nnature to suit our needs. We can't create those properties. The properties \nof a photon should be the same for all other photons in the universe. \n\n\n\nOnce we defined what the number 1 was and what it was worth, all other \nnumbers had to follow it. Math as we know it had to be built on what 1 \nmeant and what it was worth. If we change the meaning and value of 1, our \nmathematical concepts fall apart. If an alien species invented what \"WE\" \ncall numbers and gave them values, they would have to build mathematical \nconcepts based on how they define numbers. In fact, they probably wouldn't \neven call what we call numbers, numbers. How they quantify their world is \nirreverent. The value of 1 in any alien species, should be translatable to \nother mathematical language. The value of 1 should mean the same thing to \nevery alien mathematical language if translated to native tongue. Exactly \nhow \"hello\" can be translate to other languages. If we invented math to \ntranslate or understand how our universe works, then other alien species \nwhat have to be able to do that same.\n\n\n\nWhether math is a discover or a invention lies in whether you can get your \nidea of math to work with nature. If you can't get your math to work with \nthe laws of nature, then your version of math is useless. Math has to be \nable to predict how nature works. It must explain how we view nature. You \nhave to be able to predict the nature around you with math, regardless of \nwhere you are in the universe. An alien species would have to obey the laws \nof nature just like we do. Since we can't change the laws of nature, all we \ncan do is translate it using math. Because of that, math just might be a \ndiscovery, rather than a invention. If you could invented math, you would \nalso have to invented the laws of nature. And math must explain nature.\n\nThe real question is whether our not nature has only one translation.\n\nIn my opinion, math was discovered by man because we think.\ufeff",

The good, the bad, the scientists, the \narchitects, the dictators. We can only imagine (and I refer here to John \nLennon) a world with no religion. How would this world look like? \n\nReligion had a strong influence on all people, no doubt, but so did honey. \nOr alcohol. Or pet dogs and cats. Or vegetables. Or other people. Or books, \nIf I may name a better\nand less ironic example. Should any influence be mentioned? \n\nPerhaps I could make the context of my personal disapproval of God being \nmentioned in an educational video even clearer. I come from a country where \nreligion is being pushed into education, science and has a growing \ninfluence in the government. It is forced down the throats of my fellow \ncitizens by the mass media, by the priests and by the creationist governors.\n\nI am all for the freedom of religion. But as long as one keeps his religion \nto himself and we can live in a peaceful and secular world of science and \nreason. And when it comes to technology, education and development (those \nthings that TED stands for), I can see more of a negative influence of \nreligion, rather than a positive one, no matter how much I try. \n\nConsider those science books that have been banned by the inquisition \nduring history. The books that have been burned. The libraries that have \nbeen burned. The free thinkers thathave been burned. Was that an influence \nof religion? Or perhaps this led to an artificial lack of influence that \ncould have otherwise brought up more scientists and educated men. \n\nWe know a lot of dark facts about the dark ages and the religious wars \nwaged at those times that have never stopped and continue up to this very \nday. In some countries people are killed for having the wrong religion or \nhaving no religion at all. Or they are killed for having a different sexual \norientation, because a holy book says that is a sin against God. Or they \nare killed or sent to prison for drawing or saying something that some \nreligious people do not approve. Or for art that some religious people do \nnot like. Must I name these countries or do we all understand what I am \ntalking about?\n\nSome of these countries are somehow at good diplomatic terms with other \npowerful countries that claim to be secular. Possibly one that you live in. \nBecause we are thought to respectall religions. We are thought that \nreligions are important and good influences, not a source of prejudice, \ndiscrimination and violence. So when I see that something as irrational and \ndangerous as religion becomes entangled with beautiful and wondrous science \nin an educational video I can't help to feel as if someone drew a swastika \non a painting by Isaac Levitan.",

So here is my educated oppinion: Kant has \nnothing to do with physics OR relativity in the physical sense. It's great \nto have an open mind, but if you open your mind to bullshit like \nmetaphysics your brains will fall out. Methaphysics is like astrology, a \nbunch of unproven speculation. Same thing with theology. So please don't \ninsult the mind of a scientist by comparing biology and physics to mythical \nnonsense.\n\nI am not surprised that philosophers that publish in the \"Polish journal of \nphilosophy\" are more than happy to steal the discovery of a great physicist \nand attribute it to their field (as they have done many times before). They \nhave done nothing for our scientific advancement. What they do is they brag \nabout \"how important philosophy is\" but bring nothing of importance to the \ntable. Another great physicist Richard Faynman said, I quote: \"Philosophy \nis bullshit\". And I am not taking this out of context.

An \nexample: physics did not invent gravity. Gravity has always been a \nnaturally occurring phenomenon; physics, or \"the science of matter, energy, \nmotion, and force,\" merely allowed human beings to discover and learn about \ngravity. So, are you defining \"mathematics\" as a science or a naturally \noccurring phenomenon? I personally believe in the reality of math that is \nexistent regardless of man's understanding.\n\nOn another note, I'm bothered when people, upon observing the beauty of a \nnatural phenomenon and appreciating it in awe, give science the credit for \nthe amazement and not phenomenon itself by claiming something along the \nlines of \"I love science.\" Sure, science allowed you to discover and \nunderstand that amazing thing which you now experience, but it is the very \nreality of the universe that creates your wonder. In other words, that \nphenomenon has always been that amazing even before you realized it from \nyour scientific understanding. If you discover a beautiful phenomenon such \nas a rainbow for the first time, don't go, \"I love science\"; instead, say \n\"I love rainbows\" because the rainbow has always been beautiful whether or \nnot you knew about it and it is the rainbow which invoked amazement within \nyou, not science. Another example that might be easier to understand: it's \nlike when you realize just how amazing your spouse is and think, \"dating is \nwonderful!\" No, it's not dating, or the process of discovering your spouse, \nwhich caused your appreciation; it was your spouse. You should think, \"my \nspouse is wonderful\" because he/she is! Your spouse has always been \nwonderful whether or not you met him/her through dating (I know people \nchange, but just go with my example here). Your discovery of your spouse \ndid not didn't create the wonderfulness within your spouse; it merely \nallowed you to experience it. In other words, science didn't create the \namazing reality of life, and therefore, your discovery should not be \ncredited for the awe induced by reality. \ufeff",
