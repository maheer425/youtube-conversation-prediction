Its just the child's \nresponsibility to put forth the effort to participate in those activities. \nA child with the mindset that school is a waste of time, can not and will \nnot be successful because if they cant do anything in school right, than \nhow can they make it in the real world.

If there is a lack of real life skills then add some \ntime in school for that, but dont diss the whole of the educational system \nfor that.\n\nAs for the lack of morals taught in schools, I dont exactly see how it's \nthe schools responsibility to do that. I mean if it WAS schools \nresponsibility then who decides what morals to teach? Wouldnt that just be \nincredibly subject to different biases to whoever sets them?\n\nI feel my school (in Gloucestershire, England) gave me a very good \nunderstanding of real life and I know that they'd support me if I needed to \nfill out something like a checkbook or finance for something I'd need, so I \nreally do not know where this video is coming from.\n\nSome last words, teaching how to build a house is definitely not job of \nschool, but I agree that leadership SHOULD be taught, and in my school it \nis through many ways including sports, group work, having opportunity to be \nleaders in school etc.\ufeff",

What I did observe in our country was that the worst \nteachers climbed the ladder of power. They weren't happy in the classroom, \nthey couldn't teach, so they got themselves out of the classroom by \nclimbing the ladder.  Then, when they were at the top they could tell the \ngood teachers how to teach and what to teach.  So, incompetence was \nrewarded.  I don't know if that occurs in your country, but I do get a bit \nworried when we get told that teachers are at fault.\n\nWhat's at fault is the incompetent idiots at the top telling the competent \nteachers who choose to stay in the classroom and teach the kids, how and \nwhat to teach. They get ahead because they know the system, know the \nlanguage of success in the system, and they use that.  They are so ignorant \nabout teaching itself, that a great percentage of our children even leave \nschool being unable to read and write. Why? Because the teacher is expected \nto teach everything and waste their time on absolute irrelevancies.\n\nI agree the system has to change, but maybe we better take a closer look at \nwhat is actually happening.  I left the system as soon as I could because \nit got to the point where I had done my study time, got a good grounding in \nvarious different disciplines which I thought would be good to have and \nthen went back out into the system, only to be told what to teach by those \nwho had NO idea.\n\nI went from being allowed to withdraw the kids from class and I ended up \nworking in the classroom with the children supporting the class teacher. A \nglorified teacher aide. I don't mind doing that. What I minded was that so \nmany kids with disabilities have underlying auditory and visual processing \nproblems and frankly, the classroom is not the best place to \"teach\" them. \nThey need rooms which don't have all the art hanging off the walls (visual \ndistraction), where there is quiet (auditory processing problems) and those \nwho do have hearing problems require to be looking at the person trying to \nteach them.
