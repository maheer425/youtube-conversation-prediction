Still the \nMatrix was chosen by the people themselves who decided one day they \npreferred to shop in supermarkets and equip themselves with computerized \ngadgets as well as be part of a process which offers more choice and the \nmore choice there is the more one thing can be connected to another in the \nsame way an intricate spider web will connect from one strand to another.\nLogically speaking there has to be some form of structure in a world which \nhas developed it's forms of communication, Computer technology is only evil \nif it's used for evil purpose, otherwise it's a very admirable invention \nand makes many things a lot easier for people. It's a wonderful way to \nlearn about the world around and read about history, to keep in contact \nwith family and friends as well as a place to share thoughts and ideas.\nGreeks and Romans developed the highest intellectual forms of early \ncommunication and they are still used to this day and have been expanded \non.\ufeff",

            "text": "This defining short scene from The Matrix (1999) is layered with \nphilosophical significance. Neo\u2019s conscious decision to swallow the red \npill brings enlightenment and abandonment from the Marxist notion of \u2018false \nconsciousness\u2019. Additionally, the sentiment behind Rousseau\u2019s contention \nthat \u201cman was born free, and everywhere he is in chains\u201d is illustrated by \nMorpheus\u2019 wisdom that \u2018The Matrix\u2019 is \u201cthe world that has been pulled over \nyour eyes to blind you to the truth\u201d. The persistent illusion of a \nfabricated reality, described as a \u201cprison for your mind\u201d, has a strong \nresonance with modern Capitalism and religion as an \u201copiate for the \nmasses\u201d. In conjunction with Marx and Rousseau, Plato\u2019s \u2018Allegory of the \nCave\u2019 and mistaking appearance for reality is also metaphorically invoked. \nThe illusion and irony behind the notion of utopia and dystopia is also \nhighlighted throughout the film, and alludes to influential literature of \nthe 20th century such as 1984, Brave New World and The Hand Maid\u2019s Tale. \nFor example, it is only a dystopia from a human perspective, which has been \nphilosophically and conceptually explored throughout the history of the \nscience fiction genre. For the thinking man\u2019s film critic, The Matrix is a \nfilm that challenges your perception of modern society and free will. It is \nfair to say that the Wachowski brothers definitely did their best work with \nthis classic, and despite the bitterly disappointing sequels, re-defining \nthe science fiction genre of filmmaking is no mean feat and certainly needs \nto be celebrated. So, with that in mind\u2026follow the white rabbit. \ufeff",
