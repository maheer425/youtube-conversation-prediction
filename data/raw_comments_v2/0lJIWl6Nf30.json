MSNBC and YTY \ndon't understand they only get those age group buy who is paying the bill. \nThey don't take in the factor of many people in the house hold watching the \nnews. For example a father of 45 years old that have 5 children watching \nfox news the ratings don't count the children only the person paying the \ncable bill.\n\nYou don't know why people hate the channel fox. You are nothing more than a \nguy who joins in the banned wagon. 95% of hollywood is run by the union so \nhappens the Union is also democrats and liberals. Why Fox has bad heat \nbecause they are not part of the union.\n\nThat's all the own age I have for you right now...
