As the car \naccelerates the rear suspension compresses, squat in racing terms, and \nduring braking (decelleration) the front suspension compresses, dive. These \nare both due to the acceleration forces on the car acting about its Cg and \nmore complicated physics things. \nBut, the result is that when your minivan is accelerating or decellerating, \nthe floor is no longer perpindicular to the ground (assuming that it was \ndesigned to be perpindicular from the factory). \nI don't think the cars suspension is the driving force behind the ballon, \nbut it could be something else that is affecting the balloons motion.\ufeff",

However, it's even \nmore interesting, and more illustrative of a general principle, if you use \nthe equivalence principle from general relativity.  When you accelerate \nforwards, it's as though (or equivalent to) switching on gravity pointing \ntowards the back of the van (you're pressed backwards in your seat as the \ncar accelerates).  This new gravitational field needs to be added as a \nvector to the existing gravitational field of the Earth to give an overall \neffective gravitational field that is pointed diagonally downwards and \ntowards the back of the van.  In the end, when both the pendulum and the \nhelium balloon are there, their strings are parallel, both pointed in the \ndirection of this new effective gravitational field, one \"up\" (the balloon) \nand one \"down\" (the pendulum).  My high school students are doing an \nintroduction to general relativity, and I use this video to illustrate the \nequivalence principle.  Great video, and very thought-provoking.\ufeff",

Picking sides \nwould be irrelevant. \n\n   Sure if you \"believe\" there is no \nmeaning to life, you could decide to choose a (meaningless) side, it might \nkeep your (meaningless) life preserved a little longer, or end it quicker, \nbut it still doesn't change that it is all meaningless (if life is \nmeaningless).\n\n2. \"Yeah well if you consider life is meaningless then too bad for you. I'm \nhappy enough inventing my own meaning. Can't see how that's a bad thing. In \nthe end, choosing to join a religion is still inventing your own meaning, \nsince you're choosing to join it. You can join Christianity, you can join \nIslam, you can join Buddhism, or anything else if you want a predefined \nmeaning for yourself. I'm a free thinker and I like to follow my own path \nso I choose to focus on my life goals and such to create my own meaning. \nFreedom is a great thing, isn't it? Or maybe you're against freedom of \nchoice?...\"\n\n2. You should know now from talking with me that I do not \"believe\" in \n\"evolution\" and that I do not \"believe\" life is meaningless.\n\nYou are the one who said quote \"I'm here by chance, as we all are. There is \nno meaning to life, but it's our job to invent our own meaning.\".\n\n You can invent up as many different meanings as you want, but within your \n\"belief\" it all boils down to be meaningless anyways. \n\n   However \"Might\" is always \"right\" because again if someone else with a \ndifferent \"belief\" is stronger than you, you are out of the picture, (maybe \neven literally in some cases). Still even this in the long run it doesn't \nreally matter according to what you \"believe\".\n\n  Being taken \"out of the picture\" is also meaningless. Death itself would \nbe meaningless according to \"your\" \"belief\".\n\n  To that, death by \"suicide\" would I think become a very real thing to be \nchosen by some of those who \"believe\" in your \"belief\". If it is all \nmeaningless, anyways.\n\n   If their \"invented\" self taught lie to cover up the meaninglessness of \nlife starts to become meaningless to them, what is to stop them from just \nopting out of coming up with a new one? \n\n  Better yet, when an older person is getting to be a little \"hard to deal \nwith (according to some\". According to your belief system those who \n\"believe\" life is meaningless can just invent up the \"belief\" that older \npeople should be killed, because life is after all meaningless anyways. Why \nshould they have to work to take care of this older person if they can just \ninvent up a reason not to? I suppose though this would have to become \nmajority rule first though huh (might is right)?\n\n  Also no sense in feeling bad for those people (who may not even \"believe\" \nin this \"belief\" of life being meaningless) who are killed by someone else \n(whom they did not know believed differently than the way they did) who \ndoes \"believe\" life is meaningless and has lied to himself by inventing his \nown \" self taught meaningless meaning\" of killing everyone else.\n\n   You seem to say that \"believing\" a religion is inventing ones own \nmeaning, but that is only true if your \"belief\" is correct and there is no \nmeaning to life. \n\n   You are trying to lock everyone into your \"belief\" that there is no \nmeaning to life.\n  \n    If one of the other religion's (beliefs) is true then your religion is \nactually the one that is wrong, and you will be effected by whatever that \nreligion was about. \n\n3. \"I'm a free thinker and I like to follow my own path so I choose to \nfocus on my life goals and such to create my own meaning. Freedom is a \ngreat thing, isn't it? Or maybe you're against freedom of choice?...\"\n\n3. You can \"believe\" anything you like. You can even \"believe\" that your \n\"belief\" is true even though it may not be.\n\n  Again it is fine according to your \"belief\" that you can make life goals \nand create your own meaning.\n\n I am simply pointing out that according to your \"belief\" you are simply \nlying to yourself in doing this. \n\n You are saying that there is meaning to something, that is according to \nyou already proved to be meaningless. \n\n It is like one calling an apple an orange to make them self feel better.\n\n If you want to \"believe\" this inside your \"belief\" that is fine. Just \nrealize then that your own \"belief\" states that others are free to do the \nsame thing. Also please realize that your \"belief\" is again just a \"belief\" \nit may be wrong.\n\n Also another point to make is that freedom in your \"belief\" is also \nmeaningless and is only another invented meaningless meaning that you have \ndeceived yourself to live by.\n\n   It would be an invented \"belief\" that someone else might not even share \nwith you  in their own invented up version of trying to give meaning to \nsomething that is meaningless.\n\n Their made up meaning to life may be communism, and if they are stronger \nthan you, then your freedom will only be \"believed\" by you to exist as long \nas you are allowed to live and keep imagining it in your mind.\n\n   It again comes back to might is right. Although it also comes back down \nto it doesn't matter (according to your \"belief\" that is (unless we are \ntalking about your made up \"belief\" within your \"belief\", but even then it \nis still under all the makeup, meaningless)) because it is all meaningless \naccording to your starting \"belief\".\n\n If you want to know, in my \"belief\" I am not against the freedom of \nchoice. I do \"believe\" that there will be consequences for those choices \nthough.\n\n  I am not going to post your entire next statement because I \"believe\" it \nrude to use profanity and don't \"believe\" it is necessary. That is again is \nmy \"belief\". The profanity will be replaced with a (*).\n\n4. \"This is the kind of argument that leads me to think you're a...\" * \n...\"moron.\"\n   \nIt is your \"opinion\" that I am a moron. \n\n5. \"Thanks for reminding me yet again that your head is hollow by claiming \nthere's no evidence for evolution. A reptile giving birth to a bird xD \nYou're remarkably stupid.\"\n\n Again \"your\" \"opinion\". \n\n   My point in asking for an experienced living example of a reptile giving \nbirth to a bird (or at least laying an egg that hatches into a bird) was \nbecause you will not admit that what you \"believe\" (Macro-evolution not \nMicro evolution) is just that, a \"belief\".\n\n  Along with this you will also not show how it can be personally \nexperienced today to be called science. \n\nScience is knowledge, knowledge is a clear and certain perspective of that \nwhich exists.\n\n  In order to be able to observe that which exists it must actually exist. \nEvolution is just a \"belief\". \n\n To explain further why I mention the reptile giving birth to a bird, it is \nbecause loosely stated that is what your \"belief\" is, only that your \n\"belief\" adds that it takes millions of years to happen and that the \n\"change\" happens through millions of generations of reptiles \"evolving\". \nWhich means it cannot today be called science.\n \n  Truth be told I have stated this before, but science was born with the \nfirst man, and it will die with the last man.\n\n Even if one earthly man claimed to have lived 20+ billion years, and \nclaimed to have observed personally evolution happening somehow from the \nbeginning, (which no man has ever stepped forward claiming they have \nlived to see evolution from the start, and which according to \"your\" \n\"belief's\" common \"disbelief\" of God it would be an unlikely possibility \nbecause they would have had to have themselves existed before existence) \nthem claiming to see it would not make it science for another person who \nhad not seen it. It could only be passed on by word of mouth or writing and \nthen \"believed\" on by \"faith\" by another person, unless that person them \nself could then go and experience the same thing. \n\n   How does the person hearing the claim know for sure that the person \ndeclaring it isn't lying unless they can experience it for them self? If \nthey did know, they would not have to believe it by \"faith\".\n\n For instance people who \"believe\" what the bible says about Jesus are \nbelieving by \"faith\" on what other people declared to have seen in their \nlifetime . It yes could really have happened (which I \"believe\" it did), \nbut that does not mean it is science unless I can personally experience \ntoday what they experienced. \n\n   This is why I \"personally\" \"believe\" Jesus said \"Thomas, because thou \nhast seen me, thou hast believed:blessed they that have not seen, and have \nbelieved.\" John 20:29 KJV.\n\n  This is getting back to the point that Destin is showing science in his \nexperiment because it can actually be personally experienced by other \npeople.\n\n\n  6. \"I'll tell you a way to tell right from wrong: Make your own mind \nabout it, and get people to agree with you. It's meaningful to you and to \nthe people around you and that's more than enough to establish laws and get \nthe world going.\" \n\n6. According to your \"belief\", that would only be your your \"belief\" of how \nto tell right from wrong. As we have already established your \"belief\" is \nthat life is meaningless.\n\n  In your \"belief\" system, someone is free to invent whatever way they \nwant, so that they can tell right from wrong. \n\n They don't even have to invent a way to do it if they don't want to, \nbecause in the end it is all meaningless anyways according to \"your\" \n\"belief system\" not mine.  This does however show again how your \"belief\" \nleads to \"might\" equals \"right\".\n\n7. \"You know what doesn't work though, is basing your morality on some \nimaginary being you have ZERO evidence of.\"\n\n7. This is again is only your opinion based on your \"belief system\" (which \nleads one to \"believe\" quote \"I'm here by chance, as we all are. There is \nno meaning to life, but it's our job to invent our own meaning.\").\n\n   \n I have expressed this several times in another argument with you that I \nadmit that my \"belief\" that God created cannot be personally experienced to \nbe called science. You however will not admit that your \"belief\" cannot be \npersonally experienced to be called science either.\n\n  Maybe though that is a part of your \"belief\" as well (although I think \naccording to your \"belief system's\" \"belief\" it would have to be one of \nthose invented up \"beliefs\" so as to give imaginary meaning to ones already \nmeaningless life).\n\n8. \"Don't throw bricks when you live in a glass house.\"\n \n8. According to your \"belief\" system my glass house would be meaningless, \nand so my glass bricks that I would throw would also be meaningless as well.\n\n  I don't understand why one who \"believes\" in your \"belief\" system would \nconcern themselves with the meaningless damage that meaningless glass \nbricks could cause to someone else's meaningless glass house, \nunless of course that person has again invented up some meaningless meaning \nto mask their already meaningless existence according to their own \nmeaningless \"belief system\".\n\n9. \"Tired of argueing with a hillbilly with a potato for a brain. Don't \nbother writting a reply, I'll just delete it. Yeah it's ad hominem, so \nwhat, you deserve to be ridiculed, you're insane.\"\n\n9. Again this is just your opinion.\n\nAs far as why you threatened me not to reply back, that is something other \npeople can sort out using their own various \"beliefs\". \n\n I will admit I don't understand how youtube works entirely so I don't know \nhow you could delete my comment other than deleting your comment leaving \nmine hanging (if that is even possible). \n\nStill with this message I have indeed replied.\n\n   I will also post our entire original argument (minus your profanity \nwhich I will replace with a \"*\") after a series of --,  and I will post \nthis whole message under another person's comment besides your own, in case \nyou do carry out your threat to delete my comments (somehow?). The reason I \ndo this is because \naccording to \"my\" \"belief\" this argument does matter.\n\n  If you ever do get tired of your \"belief\" of a meaningless life. I would \nlove to share with you my \"belief\" in my God, who I \"believe\" loved you so \nmuch that he sent his son to die for your sins, be buried, and then rise \nagain on the third day (according to the scriptures that told that it would \nhappen before it did happen). My \"belief\" even \"believes\" that there were \nreal people who made declarations and writings about how they personally \nexperienced these events happening so that people like me can choose to \n\"believe\" what they said by \"faith\".\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the original trail of conversation.\n\n\n ARMATHYX Said:\n\n\"\"I'm here by chance, as we all are. There is no meaning to life, but it's \nour job to invent our own meaning.\"\n\nCAR DEC Responded:\n\n\"1. Well that is your \"belief\" that you are here by chance and that there \nis no meaning to life.\n\n   So in regards to this \"belief\" that it is our job (why do you think you \ncan assign this job to everyone if there is no meaning to life?) to invent \nour own meaning to life. Does that mean what Hitler did was perfectly fine?\n\n If there is no meaning to life then it doesn't really matter. Sure a \nperson could express their opinion on the matter, but it really boils down \nto being meaningless in the long wrong, because life itself would be \nmeaningless. Right and wrong would not exist.\n\n\n This is the kind of thinking that leads people to believe that \"might\" is \nalways \"right\".\n  \n You can argue that Hitler believed in God and I can argue right back that \njust because someone claims to believe in God does not mean that they are \ndoing what he said to do.\nThere is a difference in \"believing\" in God and actually doing what he said \nto do.\n\n  From talking to you in another argument I can very well assume the reason \nyou \"believe\" that you are here by chance is because of your \"belief\" in \nevolution. Well that seems to say something about where the \"belief\" in \nevolution is directing some of those who \"believe\" in it.\n\n If this \"belief\" in \"evolution\" is true (which it has never been proved, \ngive me a living example where I can personally experience a reptile giving \nbirth to a bird), then there is no way to tell right from wrong. Actually \nthere would be no point to even try.\n\n  I am certainly not saying that you personally don't have any morals. What \nI am trying to point out is that if you \"believe\" what you \"believe\" then \nyour morals are meaningless in the long wrong.\"\n\nARMATHYX Responded: \n\n \"Ugh this stupid argument again. Of course from the perspective of Hitler \nand of his millions of followers, what he did was right. Isn't it obvious? \nAnd from our perspective it isn't.
