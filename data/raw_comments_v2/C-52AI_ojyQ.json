In \nthe mid 1700s, British English sounded rather close to a modern American \n\"flat\" accent, the kind you'd hear on American news (West Country is the \nclosest modern British equivalent to this old accent). The mainstream \nBritish accent changed quite a bit throughout the later 1700s and early \n1800s to what it is now while the old accent changed much less in the US. A \nfew major changes included the dropping of the letter R at the ends of \nwords and some vowel shifts, most noticeably in the letter A. Different \nspellings can be attributed to the fact that spelling wasn't fully \nstandardized at the time that America was first colonized. The term \n\"gasoline\" was coined by a British man, and that name caught on in the USA. \n\"Gasoline\" later lost popularity in Britain in favor of the term \"petrol.\" \n\"Soccer\" was also coined by the British. It evolved out of the term \n\"Association Football\" which was used to distinguish the game from Rugby \nFootball, whose fans often just referred to it as \"football\" (hence the \nname for American Football, which evolved from Rugby). \"Soccer\" is an \nexample of an Oxford -er added to the \"soc\" from \"Association Football.\" \nWhen it comes to the long and short scales, both were used in Britain on \nand off throughout history. When America and Britain split, the long scale \ngained popularity in Britain and the short scale gained popularity in \nAmerica. There are many other examples of this as well. Before calling a \ndifference between British and American English \"incorrect\" for the \nAmericans, take care to look into its origin.
