Here are my \nsuggestions for the top ten stories of 2014: 1) Ebola outbreak, 2) ISIS, 3) \nEric Garner and Michael Brown killed, 4) Crimea crisis, 5) World Cup in \nBrazil, 6) Sochi Winter Olympics, 7) 43 disappearing students in Mexico, 8) \nIsrael war, 9) child immigrants to the United States, 10) Nigeria girls \nkidnapped. Honorable mentions may include: Justin Bieber arrested, Malaysia \nAirlines disappearing, new iPhone, new announcement of immigration reform, \nand Republicans win control of Congress. What an eventful year! Deaths of \nseveral notable people too: Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Maya Angelou, Joan \nRivers, Robin Williams, Roberto Gomez Bola\u00f1os, Michael Rooney. I hope the \n2014 one comes soon. \ufeff",
