I've been learning English since 2012 and \nin the last 9 months I've been living in the U.S. which has shown me how \nknowing well the language where you live makes all difference when it comes \nto make friends or fit in the culture! Some people think that this is \nrelated to native speakers not being patient enough with foreigners or they \nhaving bias against those who can't speak well. However, this is not the \nproblem at all. What happens is that when you can't communicate effectively \nyou are less likely to understand the people's culture that you interact \ndaily and they won't understand for real either. It's not about a good \ngrammar or speech, but it's about your willingness to see things in their \nperspective and having it as motivation to keep improving your language. \nUnfortunately, nowadays people are very perfeccionist with language \nlearning and they try all the time to tell you that you are not good \nenough, so you may start to not realize your progress because you stop to \nenjoy the trip by focusing too much on the destination. I've been facing \nthis problem. Though, thanks a videos like that I can stop and rethink what \nspeaking English actually means to me. It's really easy to get lost in this \nprocess. I've been considering learning Spanish and French but I always \nfeel like \"my English is not good enough to start learning another \nlanguage\"... Well, it would be true if maybe I wasn't fluent in English. \nBut since I am, it only means that I am too afraid of not being perfect in \nevery language that I want to target. I admit this problem and after this \nvideo I can see how stupid this thought is!\ufeff",

Like he learned many languages for fun in teenage years, \nI was learning math, programming, physics, chemistry, biology. Noticed many \ncommon patterns, not so much in subjects themselves as in how their \nproblems in competitions could be addressed - similar techniques, tricks. \nSo when in 9th grade got into top 5 (among 9th graders) in all 5 national \ncompetitions of my little country, many looked at it like \"wow, \nunprecedented, no comment\". But in fact it wasn't that unusual, it didn't \nrequire some extraordinary preparation or effort, just enough curiosity and \nfun practice during 3 previous years. Perhaps biology was an outlier - it \ninvolved learning a lot of names and writing essays, so I dropped it pretty \nsoon and got my interest back when later topics (population genetics, \nevolution, systems biology) made much more mathematical sense. It's amazing \nhow powerful positive feedback can be, even without some inherent \nextraordinary ability. More generally his example (and mine) support the \nconcept of schema learning, which is still not universally accepted and too \nlittle studied by the neuroscience community.",
