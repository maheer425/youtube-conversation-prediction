The powder would seep into the \nvictim's feet thanks to the glass shards, and slow their heart rate and \nbreathing to the point where it was almost undetectable; the victim would \nthen be pronounced dead. Once the victim was buried, the clan who would put \nthe Zombie powder down in the first place would rob the grave and wake the \nvictim (who was already dead to society) and sell them into slavery. (No \none would look for the victim, since they were \"dead\".) This is supposedly \nwhere the Zombie myth originated.\ufeff",
