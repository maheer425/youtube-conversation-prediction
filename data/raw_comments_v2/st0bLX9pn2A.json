When you get braces its going to hurt a while, so take \nAdvil RIGHT after you get them. You'll thank me, don't expect them to come \noff the exact date they say. They will probably come off 3 months after the \ndue date. Lastly, when you drink soda, make sure you brush your teeth right \nafter just so your teeth don't stain.\nCongratulations you'll soon be in the brace face club!",
