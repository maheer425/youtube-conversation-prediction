I see a lot of things that others \ndon't, I find beauty in things that others only see as ugly.I am an artist, \nand work with many different mediums. I especially love working with \ncolours.\nWhen I see a colour, I see the colours that make that colour. For example, \nwhen seeing green, I see the base,which is blue and from there I see what \npercentage of yellow was used to make that shade of green. Then can tell \nhow much white or black was used if any, to determine how light or dark the \ncolour may be. This is not something that was taught to me. In fact, I've \nnever taken an art class in my life. And I have never limited myself to \njust one medium. I will see a medium and/or what someone could do with it, \nand if it intrigues me, I will just start doing it. Of course the longer \nyou practice something, the better you get at it. Photography is one of my \nfavorite.... Instant gratification these days. And the sky is one of my fav \nsubjects, and night time is awesome ie, the moon.\ud83c\udf1d\ufeff",
