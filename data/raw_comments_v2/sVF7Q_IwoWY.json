The original idea was just to put a 1uz in and hopefully some ITB's \nbut it turns out that my dad (who is a mechanic that i don't live with) has \nan Eaton Supercharger laying around lol so that saves us time from \nturbocharging the 1uz. BMW e30's are really cheap here where I am (in South \nAfrica) and im anyway planning on swapping in e36 suspension to handle the \nextra torque and a different ratio differential that will spin faster and \nhopefully not break. The engine is also going to be balanced and have the \nredline raised via software.\n\nAs for +justforever96 I respect that you prefer i6 engines for BMW's but \nsaying that even the modern one should not have been a V8 (referring to the \nS65B40 found in the e92 M3) is quite a bold statement as many people prefer \nV8's because of the noise and N/A torque. Also im pretty sure that BMW knew \nwhat they were doing lol, especially the M-division. \n\nGoing back to my build...\nIt is just meant to be a fun weekend drift/track car and i dont intend on \nit making 1000bhp etc. Anyway i hope that clears things up. \n\nHave a great day :D",

I may have mixed up my words and not been \nclear.  Not to mention that \"towing\" to me doesn't only mean being able to \nmaintain speed up hills but also that the truck in general isn't going to \ndie on me way out somewhere meaning that again Toyota has the leg up. To \nme, being able to drag-race with a trailer on behind you, while COOL is not \nreally useful esp when you're taking a fuel consumption hit just to have \nexcess power in reserve.  To me Diesel's are all about having enough engine \nto pull/haul your load and a bit more for flexibility, but not a whole \nother engines worth just to compete with the guy in the OTHER truck next to \nyou.  They make 4500's for a reason and I can see the point for true \ncommercial users, but I'd wager 99% of the FS trucks sold in the US never \nactually get used as work trucks (even if they claim them as such on their \ntax returns).  I call it the \"contractor syndrome\" where they all \"have to\" \nbuy a FS truck and then LIFT IT making it useless for work, but they're \n\"fitting in\" with the rest of the posers.  Kind of like GM SUV's and \nsoccer-moms who COULD be helping the fellow motorists be more safe and \ndriving smaller cars since they can't drive for shit anyway but no, they \nGOTTA have the biggest pile of shit the US has ever made by the thousands \ncause \"every one of my girlfriends has one\"  The US auto-industry reflects \nthe sheer stupidity of the people of this country WAY too well.\n\nSadly we don't see the Toyota Diesels (not sure WHY???) here but as someone \nwho's lived a fair few places around the world and run Toyota 4wd's \nprofessionally let me tell you if they ever bring a Diesel to the US it's \ngame over for everyone but Dodge and the superior Cummins.
