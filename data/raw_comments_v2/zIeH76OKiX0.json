The only thing is that you \nhave to wash and rinse quinoa always before cooking, and then preparing it \nlike rice (1 part quinoa, 1 1/2 parts boiling water, low heat and the lid \non for 20 minutes).

I \ndidn't have mint so I'll try that next time and the only other thing I \nchanged was instead of the lemon I used a whole lime and the zest too for \nthe quinoa. The sheet pan isn't necessary if you do 2 parts water to 1 part \nquinoa, no draining just cook 15 to 20 minutes till it absorbs the water \nand then set aside covered and it will get all fluffy, then just add the \ncitrus right before serving. The chiles in the vinegar mixture were life \naltering and I will use the black bean technique over and over again. As \nJamie would say BRILLIANT!!\ufeff",
