If your really oconcerned about your personal internet speed i \nwould highly suggest moving becuase im quite frankly fed up with att \nmyself. theres no excuse at all to claim dsl as a highspeed service in 2015\n\nI could get behind an idea like not throttling based on source but Well \nquite frankly the question comes down to drawing the lines.  becuase you \nand i both know youll never ever ever have a perfect system that segments \nall data into appropraite paths so some services are going to suffer just \nby the semi-arbitrary nature of such a system. Now if you do like you \nsuggest and throttle data purely by type rather then source what your going \nto do is still having video companies take up a rediculous portion of all \ntraffic and let us not forget that youtube netflix and hulu while there the \nbig data users are not the only sources. Think about every pornographic \nsite on the internet. what your suggessting would mean every porn site \nrunning off a server rack in some guys garage would have the same priority \nas a multi billion dollar company like youtube. Infact if like you said \ncompanies frequently agree to take on heavier loads then what they can \nrealisticlayy handle where looking at a real possibility of a ddos attack \nby malicious third parties who could just set up a ton of servers dedicated \nto video streaming in hd (weird hypothetical i know but weirder things have \nhappend)\n\n\nNow if the companies themselves fail to provide services withen reasonable \nexpectations of what they offer, i say let them fail.

            "text": "+Jon Deal Well if you have that many options consider yourself lucky. I \nlive in Houston Tx the 4th largest city in the country and in my area I \nhave exactly two options. Theoretically my zip code is in the area of 4 \nbroadband companies but since Im on the edge of the city the only ones that \nactually service to my area is Comcast or AT&T DSL. Add to that fact I live \njust on the edge of the DSL 1.5Mbps coverage, and having worked for a \ncompany that provided DSL I know that means. They will try to sell it to me \nbut I will always have problems with weak signal and dropped service in any \nkind of inclement weather. So my choices are shitty or shittier.\n\nAs for the example of the exclusive contracts the point I was trying to \nmake was their shady business model, and in some cases such things are done \nbefore people can even learn about them to react about them. I only \nencounted this when I had an apartment and I found out a month later the \nonly cable company allowed was TWC because the owner got a cut back. But \nIve read about HOAs that will go into multi year contracts that will \nautomatically start charging all residents done in secret by its board, and \nsome that start of good but over time go to hell because they have no \nincentive not to. Here is an example: \nhttp://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Virginia-ISP-Sues-Everybody-After-Being-Forced-to-Compete-123474 \nhttp://www.leesburgtoday.com/news/state-supreme-court-denies-openband-appeal-petition/article_f583ee2c-a3e2-11e3-aaa4-001a4bcf887a.html\n\nThe problem with your argument about large data users slowing down service \nto customers is that it would be only the fault service provider as they \nagreed to provide that much data transfer capabilities but oversold the \ncapabilities. I know it happens in every industry, ever windup on a \noverbooked flight or have a pizza delivered an hour late? But right now if \nI pull up Netflix or Hulu the data has to go through the same channels. But \nif net neutrality is not passed Comcast could parter with Hulu and suddenly \nNetflix gets throttled in favor of Hulu. Verizon already has tried \nsomething similar. \nhttp://www.extremetech.com/computing/186576-verizon-caught-throttling-netflix-traffic-even-after-its-pays-for-more-bandwidth \nI work in the same complex as an L3 branch, and they where pissed over how \nVerizon trying to pin it on them could effect L3s image(smoke pits are \ngreat ways to network).\n\nThe cuts you said they would have to make would be to admit they cant offer \nthe speeds they promised and downgrade customers(not likely), upgrade the \nnetwork to actually carry the traffic sold(possible but not likely), or sit \nback and ignore it(most likely). I should probably clarify that I don't \nthink no traffic should ever get higher priority. It would make since that \nVOIP or video data would have priority over HTML simply for quality of \nservice, just that ISP should not base the throttling on where the traffic \ncomes from.\n\nI agree that there needs to be more real competition but when you have a \nbig company come in and offer you a price many times higher than the \ncompany you have is worth, a lot find it hard to say no. Even the company I \nwork for is guilty of that and they hardly blip on the evil scale compared \nto Comcast.",

But charging even more for actually using traffic we \nalready agreed on and payed for is dishonest.\"\n\n2:35 Actually if its not illegal, and we have payed for the traffic, it is \nnone of their business. Any interference in traffic could end up harming a \ncompetitor, or an attempt to force content providers into paying more.\n\nThe whole point of the issue is that while it started off as a luxury, it \nhas transformed into a crucial element in our society just as running oil, \nwater, electricity, and the phone has. Now that some some people have \nrealised how important it is, that want to start making profit at the \nexpense of society by using their massive control. This is in close \nparallel with what lead Standard Oil to getting broken up and the whole \npoint of Net Neutrality is to cut it off at the head so we don't have the \nsame fights years from now.",

            "text": "+Allballz When a government granted monopoly exists, who else besides the \ngovernment can fix it?  Your logic is badly broken.  No matter what the \n\"fix\" is it requires some change of regulation at the government level.  \nThe current laws give telecoms monopolies to bring internet the \"last mile\" \nto your home.  If we're keeping those laws then we need to ensure that the \ntelecoms honor net neutrality.\n\nOr we could de-regulate them and eliminate the monopoly.  However there are \nvery practical reasons why this won't happen.  It's not practical for a \ndozen different phone and cable companies to dig trenches along your street \nand dig up your driveways to install new cabling so they can compete for \nyour business.\n\nAs a libertarian I must still understand that some amount of government \nregulation is needed.  Common access to things like phone, cable, and \nroadways is good for everyone and it doesn't make sense for dozens of \ncompanies to build competing roads or install competing electric, phone, \nand cable lines because then there'd be no land left to live on, rural \nareas would be criss-crossed with nothing but wires and roads.\n\nSo knowing that it's practically impossible to completely de-regulate the \nlast mile of internet service we need to decide what the compromise looks \nlike.  Yes it'd be nice if the solution was simply more competition, but if \nthat's not possible we need to make sure that when our tax money is used to \ngrant a company a monopoly to provide us a service (At a cost to us) that \nat least we don't let them abuse that monopoly.  Therefore where a monopoly \nexists net neutrality regulation should also exist.\n\nIt should also be made clear that there is no new regulation here.  We're \ntalking about treating internet service providers as \"common carriers\" \nunder laws that have existed since 1934 for all \"common carriers\".\n\nAlso keep in mind that these monopolies were granted to companies like AT&T \nand Verizon after AT&T and Verizon made legal *commitments* to use there \nmonopolies and tax money we granted them to actually build out broadband \nnetworks which they never followed through on.  They built very limited \nnetworks in very limited areas and they continue to point to that and \nexclaim about how they've fulfilled their commitments.  However the reality \nis that if you're shopping for a home, if you want to live anywhere besides \nan apartment or deep in a newly developed subdivision your broadband \nchoices are terrible at best.  I've been house shopping for 9 months around \nAustin, TX and I struggle to find properties with better than 10 Mbps \nspeeds.  Almost half of the properties that I look at have no internet at \nall.  (I'd have to do wireless).\n\nSome of these properties are within the city limits!  I currently live in a \nhome outside the city limits with 1Gbps of broadband because I happen to \nlive in one of the tiny slivers of Austin where AT&T offers Gigapower. (And \neven that only exists because of competition from Google fiber).\n\nThe bottom line is the current system is badly broken and needs to be \nrevamped.  Either we de-regulate alltogether (Which is impractical) or we \nmake sure that the regulation prohibits ISPs from abusing their monopolies \nover us.  I honestly don't understand the push-back over this.",

            "text": "+Brendan Downey\nYou need to do some research on these government-created monopolies. From \nthe Wikipedia page on the East India Company:\n\n\"...on 31 December 1600, the Queen granted a Royal Charter to \"George, Earl \nof Cumberland, and 215 Knights, Aldermen, and Burgesses\" under the name, \nGovernor and Company of Merchants of London trading with the East \nIndies.[9] For a period of fifteen years the charter awarded the newly \nformed company a monopoly on trade with all countries east of the Cape of \nGood Hope and west of the Straits of Magellan.... The prosperity that the \nofficers of the company enjoyed allowed them to return to Britain and \nestablish sprawling estates and businesses, and to obtain political power. \nThe company developed a lobby in the English parliament. Under pressure \nfrom ambitious tradesmen and former associates of the company (pejoratively \ntermed Interlopers by the company), who wanted to establish private trading \nfirms in India, a deregulating act was passed in 1694.[17]\nThis allowed any English firm to trade with India, unless specifically \nprohibited by act of parliament, thereby annulling the charter that had \nbeen in force for almost 100 years. By an act that was passed in 1698, a \nnew \"parallel\" East India Company (officially titled the English Company \nTrading to the East Indies) was floated under a state-backed indemnity of \n\u00a32 million. The powerful stockholders of the old company quickly subscribed \na sum of \u00a3315,000 in the new concern, and dominated the new body. The two \ncompanies wrestled with each other for some time, both in England and in \nIndia, for a dominant share of the trade.[17]\nIt quickly became evident that, in practice, the original company faced \nscarcely any measurable competition.\"\n\nExclusive charter to trade with half the world? Sounds like mercantilism to \nme (an early form of fascism). It was hardly laissez-faire. What do you \nthink was one of the main points of friction between the crown and the \nAmerican colonies? The flouting by American smugglers of the exclusive \nshipping privileges awarded by the crown.",

They were both GIANT businesses at a time when Europe \nran on your precious \"laissez faire capitalism\". They were terrible \nmonopolies. Without government regulation they eliminated ALL of their \ncompetition from their respective countries and THEN fought entire fucking \nWARS with each other to try and eliminate each other.

Probably total \ntrade domination over all of Europe and, therefore, the majority of the \nworld market at that point. Oh, sure... there was nothing keeping other \nsmall trading companies from cropping up, but they all died out almost \ninstantaneously. The thing about laissez faire capitalism is it doesn't \nwork. You talk of Corporatism, but that is EXACTLY what will happen. One \ncorporation controlling everything. A different kind of corporatism, but \neven worse. On the topic of Net Neutrality, which is NOT fascism, or \nsocialism, or communism, it is regulated capitalism. In fact, it's \nencouraging a more open market on the net. Netflix wouldn't be able to pay \nto get better access to consumers than some amateur streaming company (And \nbefore you say it, I know Netflix supports Net Neutrality... it's just an \nexample), thus allowing the amateur streaming company an opportunity to wow \nconsumers and show them something they have that Netflix doesn't.

What, because we are \nsupposed to live in a laissez faire capitalist republic, every rule, law, \nand government action should follow that? Cause then there's things like \nWelfare, Disability, Food Stamps, and Unemployment that are not in keeping \nwith laissez faire capitalist republicism.

(/s)\n\nalso wait wait wait. THAT IS NOT HOW SCARCITY WORKS LOL. lets take a \nclassic example of something that IS scarce. Gold, for example. Gold has \nvalue because it is in limited quantities. now lets say that instead of \nmining more gold for people to use, gold production facilities decided to \ncharge people to wear their gold jewelry - if you wanted to wear it to a \nfancy party, you would have priority over someone else who wanted to wear \nit to the club. Thus gold companies no longer have to produce more product, \nthey simply charge based on what work they did in the past.\n\nThis is irrelevant, of course, because gold is a material possession, while \nthe internet is (and should be) a UTILITY. This distinction is important - \ndo you like having electrical power for your tv and water to flush your \ntoilet with? Do you want to have to pay more to do those things than some \nrandom corporation that requires these two things for reasons unknown to \nyou, but judged more important by your isps? hell no. the same applies to \nthe internet.",
