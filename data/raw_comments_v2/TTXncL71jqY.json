I also learned to do bunny hops, broncos, and stoppies \neasily on that bike, but stunts are harder to do on larger bikes with seats \nup to properly fit the rider.  They aren't impossible to do on properly \nfitted bikes, just harder and less safe to do than on a small bike since on \na small bike you can easier catch your fall using your feet and if you do \nhappen to fall you won't fall as far & hard as on a tall bike.",
