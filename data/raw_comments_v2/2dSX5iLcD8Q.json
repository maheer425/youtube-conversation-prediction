Notice that I'm just 19 and I \ngraduated from highschool in 2012. A few hours ago I had a conversation \nwith my parents about withdrawing the career to get a translation degree \nsomewhere else. I've been to classrooms and I've had students as well \nbecause I'm a private English teacher, but I've been seriously over \nthinking about it because I'm still young and highschoolers are like... My \nage? I don't know, but I feel like that. I was seriously thinking of \nwithdrawing the career, but now that I watched this video... Wow. I'm \nthankful I watched it, because it reminded me of why I wanted to become a \nteacher.\nMy little brother has Asperger, and he's really clever and has a really \nunique personality, but he doesn't do well on his exams, because he has a \ntype of nervous anxiety and he forgets all he learned when sitting an exam, \nhe also has ADHD which it can't be treated by taking pills.\n\nMy reason of why I want to become a teacher is to help those guys like my \nbrother, because they must be valuable in whatever they want to.\n\nI also experienced a student being expelled during my practicum in a public \nschool because of his bad behaviour, and I really had hopes of him doing \nwell since he acted so nice around me and started learning English when I \ncame in (English is quite horrible in public schools here.), but they \ndidn't even gave him a chance. \nI want to save kids like him, because I know one by one we can make a \nchange.\nThank you, Simon and Martina. <3\nLove from Chile.\ufeff",
