ASSUMES it's normal while it factually isn't, and \nmight itself pressure teenagers to do it whom otherwise would not.\nThe sex education class in my second jr. high school, for example, just \ntalked about STDs, using condoms, and not having tampon accidents. It 100% \nacted like teen sex is normal, while it factually isn't, and it avoided the \nsubject of pregnancy, science to do with sex, etc. It was just a warning \nabout STDs, and tampon accidents that claimed it's all highly common when \nit wasn't, and isn't.\nIn the United States, teenagers are factually encouraged to have sex by the \ngovernment via the sex education classes that PUSH the idea of doing it, \nand TEACH how, and the media all over the place featuring teenagers whom \nhave sex, or are sexually suggestive. This country's agenda is in favor of \nit, while those countries prefer it to not happen. This country now even \nencourages teen pregnancy in it's propaganda (media), not just the sex \nitself. Canada is likewise to the United States in this department.\nAs to why should be obvious... Look at all the pedophile politicians, and \nother government employees, and bingo, you have the answer as to why North \nAmerican countries encourage teen sex. Not for them to do it together, but \nfor the huge masses of pedophiles here to be the partners instead, the \ncreeps whom largely go unpunished, or barely get a slap on the wrist, being \npretty telling of them being loved by the United States government, a \ngovernment full of pedophiles. (I don't know if Canada has a similar \nproblem. Though, it probably does. Canada actually was pushing teen \npregnancy harder, much sooner than the United States was in media... And, \nthe two countries are so similar... It must also have a problem of creeps \nrunning the government.)",

One of \nmy teachers always said the brain isn't fully developed until 25, so it's \ndifficult to make life-altering decisions when you're still a kid. So she \nalways told us not to get married or pregnant before we're at least 25.\nNot all girls in America are slutty, lol.
