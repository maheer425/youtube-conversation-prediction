Most of the \ninfluence around the world originates from those creating and presenting \nthemselves as an example for the world. The exemplary virtue as how society \nshould be progressing are the Americans and the Europeans. Those of these \nWestern societies have been propagated with the infection of Zionism \nindirectly controlling all aspects of our humanity. I would highly suggest \nto learn about AIPAC to begin with, and then move on to the the development \nof the Fed, and the Rothschild family.\n\nThe indoctrination of beliefs from an early age derive from a heavy \ninfluence of religion brainwashing a great majority of humans around the \nworld. This association of religion to a group leads to turning a blind eye \nto crimes. For example, Americans provide more than $3Billion dollars to \nthe Israels, and yet they provide very little for us. The idea that it's no \nbig deal to provide them with American tax payers money to a foreign nation \nis heavily supported by the media; which coincidentally is controlled by \nthe same Zionist Jews. The notion of foreign \"friendship\" is created out of \nmere fallacy to create a hallucination of lies.
