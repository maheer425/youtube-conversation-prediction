Of course with the \n\"Women are better at getting sex\" is the other side which people seem to be \nmissing: \"Men are better at getting meaningful relationships\"\n\nI'm sure the men reading that aren't particularly excited by that. It's a \nmatter of perspective. It doesn't mean men have it tougher or anything like \nthat. Really, men and women are like two different parts of a massive \norganism, they serve different functions, and that helps the organism as a \nwhole (humanity).

            "text": "Female embryos at a higher risk of death during pregnancy, study suggests.\n\nA new study has challenged this widely accepted hypothesis, suggesting that \nfemale embryos are actually more likely to die in the womb than males.\nBiologist Steven Orzack followed 140,000 pregnancies in the US, observing \nthe growth and health of the foetuses and embryos from one week after \nconception until they were born. In order to be precise, all the \npregnancies were the result of assistive reproductive technologies, such as \nIVF, which means the exact moment of conception could be recorded. They \nalso analysed data from almost 900,000 foetal screening tests and 30 \nmillion abortion, miscarriage and birth records, mostly from clinics in the \nUS and Canada.\n\nThe team found that at conception, there isn\u2019t a skew towards males, it \ntruly is a 50-50 split between males and females. \"The best estimate we \nhave is that it's even-steven - 50 percent males [and] 50 percent females,\" \nOrzack told NPR. Which means the skewing must occur throughout the course \nof a pregnancy.\n\n\"Data from around 800,000 amniocentesis tests, where fluid is taken from \nthe womb, showed that between weeks 10 and 15, significantly more female \nembryos are miscarried. In the third trimester, female mortality is \nslightly lower than for males, but this does not compensate for the overall \nimbalance, the study found.\n\nThe findings suggest that there could be different windows of vulnerability \nfor males and females during development, which in future could help \nscientists better understand some of the causes of miscarriage and \nstillbirth.\"\n\nExactly why females are at a higher risk in the womb isn\u2019t clear, but the \nteam discusses the possibility of the two X chromosomes in females as being \na possible cause. \ufeff",
