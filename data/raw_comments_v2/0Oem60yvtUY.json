This is still on of my favorite games of all time! Controlling other \nplayers is very easy. Just point the joystick to who you want and click the \nbutton. It is a quick movement but once you get it you will not have an \nissue again. Same to throw the ball. As you point the joystick in the \ndirection you want to throw hit the button. Only thing I cant quite \nremember is how to get the ball to the pitcher. Think it is either just the \nbutton, or, just stop and hold still. Once the runners stop and no more \nmovement is happening the pitcher gets the ball... Play it again its a \nblast!\ufeff",
