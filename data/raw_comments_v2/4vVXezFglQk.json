As for GT40 that WAS!! \ndesigned by Lola because Ford had too much riding on it and had no \nexperience building a Lemans car, you kinda said it all tbh that the Lola \ncar had Flawed Trans and Engine when it was original built so it was again \nReplaced by Ford just like the Cobra and no credit was given to the guys \nwho designed it (Probably due to Lola being bank rolled by Ford to design \nand build it).
