And I promise \nyou, something great will come of it.\u201d \n\u2015 Benjamin Mee, We Bought a Zoo\n\nWell, since I watched that movie years ago, I have often thought of that \nquote and used it.  I recently ran up to the editor of our local newspaper \nThe Dayton Daily News and asked him for his card and to be able to speak to \nhim for five minutes in the near future.  I used that 20 seconds of \ncourage.  It was more like Mel's five minute rule though actually.\n\nI'm at this point of my life where I constantly find myself pushing myself \nout of my head.  I have to - the alternative?  I don't want to find out.  \n\nI hope you find this TedTalk useful like I did.  Most of this you know - \nsometimes we need reminders.\ufeff",

            "text": "I think she is sort of right. I know what it is like to feel stuck and to \nwait to feel like doing something about it, it never happens. \n\nHowever the problem is that this is based on the age old assumption that \nhappiness is getting what you want. The truth is that you never can get \nenough of what you want to feel permanently happy and so you are forever on \nthe treadmill of trying to get more of what you want and less of what you \ndon't want. And when you have what you want you have to maintain it at all \ncosts because you have now bought into the belief that if you lose it then \nyou'll be unhappy again. And so your happiness is still uncertain and based \non things going right for you.\n\nThe alternative to this is not to say a mediocre \"I'm fine\" but to see that \neven when you get everything that you want, you'll still be the same sweet \nyou. It is to see that you are complete and whole already, not as an idea \nbut as reality, fact. Sometimes in a flash instant you see it, your totally \nfine as you are, everything is ok, it was only your mind that spins the \nideas of dissatisfaction of not being enough, of not measuring up. You see \nyour wellbeing never was tied to getting things but was always there \nwaiting to be acknowledged.\n\nperhaps you have a close shave and then feel grateful just for being alive \nand all the grumbles and mumbles disappear and you see that wow you are 1 \nin 4 billion and already unique.\nWith wellbeing already in place then you don't need to get what you want to \nfeel better,  no instead you are fired up to do what inspires you and \nexcites you and you don't fear failure because your wellbeing isn't on the \nline. You may still need to give yourself the odd shove but mostly you \ncan't wait to do stuff because you are excited and not forcing yourself to \nget on the rat race only because if you don't you'll feel crappy.\n\nCould it be that the real reason we don't feel like doing things is because \ndeep down we know that we have already bought into the idea that 'I'm not \ngood enough as I am' and that forcing ourselves will never free ourselves \nfrom that basic belief, but only mask it with \"I'm so great because I'm \ngetting what I want\"?\ufeff",
