            "text": " \nBrilliantly informative show. However, there was one point made as a \nstatement of fact which is not entirely accurate (approx 8:39) \"You have no \ncontrol over being scared\".\n\nOf course we do have control of how we rationalise any thought. Thus we can \ndecide (control) if an event is threatening or not. However, the speed at \nwhich this decision (the chemical process that may or may not lead up to \nthe release of the fight or flight behaviour)  happens can vary. Thus some \nmay perceive that they have no control over there fear, as it may appear as \nan instinctive reaction to an event. And in some situations this is \nessential, as the faster the response to that fear the more likely the \nindividual evades a potential threat.\nBut, as the presenter described, the initial process that may lead to the \nrelease of hormones combined with a mind state of hyper-tension, begins in \npart of the brain that is not subconscious.\nThus over time a  fear can be  reasoned to be  rational or irrational ( a \nfear with or without a actual threat. An imagined fear/phobia) .\nFrom my own experience many psychological disorders are driven by fear. \nEither rational because the individual is living in a dangerous environment \nor irrational due to a individuals cognitive functioning being confused by \nimagined fear (or both).\n\nEssentially we do have a choice of what to fear. Fear that which can cause \nyou biological harm. Fear in this context is essential.\n\nBiologically focused fear is what drives humans to improve there health and \nseek safer environments. Essentially, this is the \u201cin-touch\u201d evolutionary \nfear that improves our lives provided we learn from it.\n\nThough in the context of anthropogenic climate change, the majority haven\u2019t \nyet learnt the difference between rationale & irrational fears. Thus I \nthink the evidence suggests ( I'm not being too much of a generalist) that \nmany in the comparably safer developed west are being driven by their \nirrational fears. What s more, their irrational actions are producing \ncredible rationale fears for the minority whom observe their irrational \nreckless actions as they continue to burn more fossil fuels (I'm being \nslighlty hypocrital here because I continue to burn fossil fuels.The \ndifference being I'd vote in methods that would evetually lead to a  carbon \nneutral human society).\n\nHence irrationality is threatening rationality.\n\nIt's ok I have the solution :-) . We gather together all the rational \npeople with one simple question. 'Do you think evolution is real'. Those \nwhom answer \u201cyes\u201d are obviously inclined to be evidence based thinkers \n(rationale) . Those whom answer  \"No\" are being irrationale ( at least on \nthis subject thus probably many other subjects  also) . Those whom answer \n\"I don't understand the question are essentially the same as those whom \nanswer no. When you understand the question there is only one correct \nanswer. Evolution.\n\nSo once we know whom is irrational what do we do about it?. Of course that \nis the big question. The answer will solve many of humanity\u2019s self \ninflicted problems . Time is the only remedy ,which totally sucks, as again \nin the context of climate change the irrational actions of increasing \nCarbon dioxide emissions may be shortening the time we have to solve the \ndenial of evidence syndrome that inflicts so many people infected by their \nfear conditioned bias.\n\nComedy is a very effective framework. When a human is laughing they are \nmore open to suggestion. So we need evidenced based Jokes that shatter \nillusions.\ufeff",
