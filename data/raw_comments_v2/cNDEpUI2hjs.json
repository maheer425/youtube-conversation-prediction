People follow this guy like a \ncult, and yet he's consistently proven himself not even remotely worthy of \nANY following, let alone a status akin to \"political god\".\n\nThe irony of shows like his, that run on bashing fox news-esque blind \nright-wingers, is that the same shows pander to an equally misinformed and \nbiased demographic. Take a few minutes to think over what it really means \nto run a political humor show. Ridiculing the least-intelligent sect of a \nmovement, to make the entirety of that movement look bad. Then, via \nexploitation of the confirmation bias, you end up just brainwashing these \npeople into blindly accepting whatever is said on your show as truth.\n\nIn order to correctly run a political satire show, one must first assume \nthat the viewership has at least some political knowledge or interest apart \nfrom your show. That's not the case though, is it? People get their \npolitics from shows like these exclusively. And as wrong as fox news can be \nat points, at least they try and actually have discussions like adults, as \nopposed to pointing and laughing at edited clips (many of which are taken \nout of context) like children. And even if you ARE politically informed \noutside of political satire shows, it's still just intellectually numbing \nmaterial. Indulging in biased media that is as dumbed down as any of the \nmajor political outlets, will lead to you eventually succumbing (at least \npartially) to the stupidity watching such shows evokes.\n\nWhat happened to guys like William Buckley? Regardless as to what side of \nthe political spectrum you're on, the way he ran his show was THE ONLY WAY \na show of a political nature should be run. Him at a desk with his \nopponent, discussing the issue at hand. Unedited, unscripted. Often times \nhis opponents made him look bad, and vise versa, but that's the nature of \nrunning a show that consists exclusively of intellectual discourse. It's \nalways fun to re-watch some of those shows, they encouraged young people to \nstrive for intellectual greatness, to become the next buckley (or the next \nchomsky if you lean left). And it wasn't just Buckley, all politics at the \ntime were discussed via mediums such as his, both left and right leaning. \nThe only people you saw guys like Stewart debating were bill-o-rielly-esque \nmorons who could obviously do nothing but spew right-wing rhetoric, never \ndid he bring anyone that even remotely rivaled him intellectually. Not to \nmention the generous amount of editing and scripting that goes into \ncomedy-show \"debates\". HOW THE FUCK HAS IT DEGRADED TO SHIT LIKE THE DAILY \nSHOW AND COLBERT?\n\nRULE 5: \u201cRidicule is man\u2019s most potent weapon.\u201d There is no defense. It\u2019s \nirrational. It\u2019s infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to \nforce the enemy into concessions.\n\nRULE 12: Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.\u201d Cut \noff the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after \npeople and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions.\n\nLooks like leftist talking heads have been doing their reading :^)\ufeff",
