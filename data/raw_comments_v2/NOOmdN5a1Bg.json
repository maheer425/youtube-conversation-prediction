The \nrecipe was easy to follow and the results were phenomenal.  I also made a \ndifferent batch of crinkle cookies (different flavor) following someone \nelse's recipe and they fell flat and the results were horrible.  But these \nred velvet crinkles were cake-cookie-like and had both great flavor and \nbody.  This recipe is a keeper!!!  Thanks Laura!!  (P.S.  Also made your \nbraided nutella bread for the first time also, and even that turned out \ngreat!!)\ufeff",
