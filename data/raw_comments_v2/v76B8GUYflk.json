I don't know if this adds up to a hill of beans to this D'larosa \nSebastian or not but this evening a bunch of teens from Queens NY stormed \nour sacred River front space down here in ol' New Orleans.  I flagged them \nonly because it was obvious that they were all together.  I said, 'hey!  \nWhere are you from?'  They said, 'New York' and I said, 'oh, the city or \njust the State?'  Then one of them stepped up to my desk and most of his \nfriends followed him.  He said, 'Queens'.  I said, 'oh cool!'  He grinned \nlike all proud as a peacock.  I said, 'I lived in Manhattan for 7 years'.  \nThis conversation volley ball went on for about 15 minutes. It was fun.  I \ntold them that here in New Orleans we  are nice.  They laughed.  I repeated \nto them that I wasn't kidding.  People here make eye contact with each \nother.  In NYC I said they glare at anyone that dares to lift their eyes \nfrom the sidewalk.  I said that I always thought to myself 'then why are \nyou all dressed up in your Sunday best?  Them are expensive threads.  In \nNew Orleans they'll just go out in their pajamas and bedroom slippers if \nthey feel too lazy to put on the sweats.  They could give a hoot what folks \nin NYC think is acceptable garb.  On their best days they turn fashion \ninside out and upside on it's head.  Then they put fashionable blouses on \ntheir heads as head-bands and dungarees on from the waist down.  They wear \nflip flops or Ked's sneakers or sometimes just for ha has they wear Nikes \nto not go with the rest of their gig.  I love New Orleans.  They just don't \nplay along with the game at large.  Never did from day one and that was way \nback in 1718.  This funny little city will be 300 years old in 2018.  \nThat's a lot of rebellion from one little city that most of the Country \ndoesn't even know from.  How cute is that?",
