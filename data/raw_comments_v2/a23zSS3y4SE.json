Oils that come from plants for \nexample soy oil, sunflower oil, are all very, very unhealthy for your body \nand this type of oil can cause heart attacks. Oilve oil is healthy because \nit's not \"factory made\" which means it's not a \"wannabe\" oil, It has many \nbenefits and very natural which is why it's healthy for you. Next time \nanyone says that butter, heavy cream cheese and anything that includes \n\"fat\" in it is actually going to make you fat then it's absolutely false. \nDon't eat food that has oils that are factory made or come from any other \nplant besides oilves.\ufeff",
