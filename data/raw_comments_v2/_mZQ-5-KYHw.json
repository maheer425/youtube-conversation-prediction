What you are is simply \na product of influence and indoctrination of an infant all the way through \nhis adulthood. And you know what? I wouldn't even blame you for sticking to \nyour beliefs and defending yourself from what you think are people who \ndidn't even went through what you went through. I wouldn't if there was no \nsuch thing as the Internet.\n\nYou, and a lot of humans now, have access to millions of Libraries of \nAlexandria at the tips of our fingers. With a few clicks you can learn more \nthan you could back when your beloved book was written, in a fraction of a \nminute. Have you noticed that the bible shows no record of kangaroos? Have \nyou noticed it shows no record of things further than a 1km radius from the \nguy writing it? What does that tell you?\n\nWhat I blame you for, and most of humanity, is your lack of curiosity and \nyour ignorance. You only show you are weak-minded when you take a book and \nget so absorbed in it that you believe EVERYTHING it says. Would you see a \nmovie and go: \"Uhm, those fellas seem to be immune to bullets... Let me \ntry!\"?\n\nYou seem to be one of those humans destined to extinction, according to \ntrends religion will be out of humanity's system in less than 100 years (\nhttp://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2090-2099.htm#religion).\n\nYou will be remembered as the lunatics who murdered, raped, and tortured \npeople for their own best version of Dora the Explorer. You will be \nremembered as the people who slowed down progress for their imaginary \nfriend. Remembered as \"not people\", but instead a scourge, a cancer who \ntried to stop cancer research. Remembered as liars and ignorant people.\n\nAbove I see a lot of people telling you to get educated and you seem to be \nresisting. Above I see you not know what the scientific method is and what \na theory actually is. People like you make me lose most hope in humanity, \nand I'm not alone here. People think you're stupid because of that exact \nsame reason. But unlike anyone here who has called you stupid, I will not. \nI will, as apparently you do with all scientific knowledge, try my best to \nignore you and your kind and have just a little bit of hope that you'll \nbreak free from that ignorance.",

I'm terse with dark matter because, \nas you alluded to, we're still pretty much \"in the dark\" (couldn't resist) \nas to what's causing the phenomonen.  I wasn't dismissing the attempts to \nexplain it, but pointing out that the name \"dark matter\" and the way in \nwhich it's talked about lead people to think it's a concrete \"thing\".  My \nintent here, isn't to single out dark matter or the big bang(which I've \nalways \"believed in\"), but to point out that the government uses the media \nto use \"science\" to their own ends.  The science is in quotes there to \nindicate that it may or may not be real science that's coming through the \nmainstream media.\nI love science, and have been immersed in it since the 6th grade... which \nis why I'm upset.  It's being perverted by the same groups who've perverted \nall the mainstream media channels. Think the UN, CO2 emissions, carbon \ncredits, and al gore (who now runs a carbon-credit issuing company that he \nfounded ...hmmm)... this leads to what's probably essentially our only real \ndispute - your last paragraph.  Theoretically, it's right and is what \nshould be held dear in the scientific community and by the public.  \nPractically, it's wrong and needs addressing.  I'm not saying it's \neverywhere, but it's creeping in... replacing religion for the ignorant \nmasses... and even the not-so-ignorant.  Everyone does, however, seem to be \nrather ignorant to this increasingly intimate interplay between politics \nand science.  People think that it's off-limits to the corruption and \ndisinformation that control other \"facets\" of humanity.  This is a very \ndangerous thing, and needs to be called out.\nCheers-",

            "text": "+Mike Lentsch There have been many models of the big bang theory that have \nbeen ruled out over the last several decades and that will continue to \nhappen. That's a good thing. It's an indication of progress in the field. \nWhat hasn't been thrown out though is the big bang itself and the myriad of \nobservable implications that go along with it. We've only gotten more \nspecific as we throw out certain models and keep others that better fit the \nobservational data. The models only disagree about the unknowns. It's not a \nwilly nilly thing. The big bang has been repeatedly confirmed over and \nover. That's a lot of long hard work for theorists and experimentalists.\n\nIn fact, just a few weeks ago a HUGE discovery was made which confirms the \nexistence of gravity waves in the very early universe. A very sensitive \nexperiment was designed to observe these waves, if they existed, in the CMB \nwhich this video mentions. These waves are predicted by inflationary theory \nin a very specific way, and we've only just been able to observe them. \nThat's a huge deal, and a huge confirmation of inflation.\n\nDark matter is not simply fudging numbers to fit the data. There is \nevidence of gravity clumping galaxy clusters together in patters that look \nlike a strange network across the visible universe. There is even evidence \nin colliding galaxies of the visible matter interacting and coalescing as \nexpected while the effects of what we call dark matter continue to travel \non the original trajectory of the galaxy it was previously clumped with. \nGravity is presenting itself, but the nature of the matter (if it is \nmatter) producing the gravity is unseen and unknown. There are several \nexperiments running right now which have been constructed based on \nhypothesis of what dark matter might be. There are several more in \nconstruction that will come online over the next decade. And that's \nawesome. Science is always attempting to push back the current boundary of \nthe unknown. That's where it should be operating.\n\nI agree that science journalists often suck and the general media is even \nworse. They often sensationalize, misquote, overstate, and even get things \ntotally wrong. This can stick with the public for a long time even after \nscience has moved on and attempted to clarify the matter. However, I don't \nagree that a vast majority of scientists are pushing misinformation. That's \na good way to destroy your career.\n\nIn science, if you rock the boat, overturn a paradigm, AND you are \nsupported by evidence, you win a nobel prize. Science celebrates dissenters \nif they can put their money where their mouth is. If they are just \nincredulous about a certain theory because they don't like it, but they \ncan't produce a working theory that's better, then yeah, they're going to \nlose credibility. Politics and beliefs will always muddy the waters because \nhuman beings are involved. Thank God for the scientific method. If you are \ndoing it right, your bias doesn't mean a damn thing. Any scientist worth \ntheir wages is committed to that and will shift their perspective when \nreality demands it. If they don't, they will be outperformed by all the \nscientists who are doing it right.",

            "text": "+uzjedi\nI understand the scientific method, and I agree with most of what you're \nsaying.  However, these giant cosmological theories are constantly being \noverturned.  In that, I disagree that we can apply a subjective \n\"confidence\" indicator to something with demonstrably so many loose ends.  \nTo use the words \"astounding\" and \"overwhelming\", one must have base of \ncomparison, which, of course, we don't.  We have some data which may or may \nnot indicate anything.  Which is great - we can make a \"hypotheses\" out of \nthat data. But it's nothing more than an \"educated\" guess, as you've said.  \nBut how educated is a matter of pure conjecture. \nTake Dark Matter, for example.  How did that come about?  Because the \nobservations don't agree with the mathematics.  So, \"they\" say that there \nmust be \"something\" else out there to account for the discrepancy... let's \ncall it dark matter!  That's the extent of it.  I predict that the whole \ndark matter/energy theory will vanish as we \"refine\" our picture of the \nuniverse, which, at the moment, looks to be vastly different than the \ncontemporary view.  Which is how it should work - that's how we figure \nstuff out. \nMy problem is stating these things like they're fact.  Sure, some people \nknow that they're not, but the layman has an unhealthy idea of what science \nis and what scientists are telling them.  Much of this has to do with how \n\"science\" is conducted these days; keeping the status quo alive and not \npissing off your colleagues so as to not get \"blackballed\".  There is \nplenty of politics in science now... an area in which they have no place.  \nI think we can all agree on how the \"system\" uses this to it's advantage.  \nChallenge a scientist's theory and watch him/her have the same reaction as \na religious person does when you challenge their beliefs.  It's no secret \nthat \"science\", as it's presented by the mainstream smacks of a belief \nsystem.  Something is clearly wrong, here.",

On the other hand, a scientific theory is a collection \nof hypotheses that have been repeatedly confirmed through rigorous \nobservation and experimentation. It thoroughly explains an aspect of the \nnatural world and provides a framework from which specific predictions can \nbe made. These predictions are either verified or falsified through \nobservation and experiment, and thus the theory can be further refined and \nimproved.\n\nI agree that it is definitely important to indicate the varying levels of \nconfidence about certain aspects of particular scientific theories. \nHowever, this one which you are taking issue with is subject to the same \nrigorous scrutiny that the scientific method always requires. The level of \nconfidence is quite high for inflationary theory because of repeated, \nsuccessfully confirmed and predicted phenomena. In fact, it is quite \nastounding how overwhelming the evidence and predictive power of \ninflationary theory is at this point.",
