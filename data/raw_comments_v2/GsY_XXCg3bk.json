But all that needs time and we had a century to improve and \noptimize our social systems and still nobody would say that they are \nperfect. \n\nI have no clue about your \"races\". To classify humans into \"races\" is \nconsidered as racism here in Europe, so I think I know what you mean as \nmuch as I know you somehow distingiush between \"Whites\", African American, \nLatinos (whatever the difference is between Latinos and \"Whites\") and \nEastern Asians which you just call \"Asians\". I already chatted with a lot \nof US people over YT (probably like 400) and of course a lot of came up \nlike you with the racist argument and this is always a little bit strange \nfor me, because you are probably also an adult and for you randomly \nselected cosmetic attributes of one person are a valid explanation for his \nor her behavior. \n\nIn Europe we just distingiush between nationality or national heritage. \nGermany for example got today 20% of its population with a non-european \nbackground (including me), but if you are born here or just got the German \npassport you are a German (also statistically). \n\nYou know, around 20-30 years ago we had this discussion which was really \nbig in German media and politics, which was about especially the turkish \ncommunity in Germany and the partly foundation of \"ghettos\" and \"parallel \nsocieties\" and \"how can it be that some of them cant even speak German!!\" \nand many German politicians said \"this cant be, these 'evil' people living \nby our social systems, not contributing to our society, dont care about us, \nblablablabla\" and then we had experts who examined and explored this \nphenomena and in the end they came to the conclusion that the moment the \nfirst big wave of immigrants arrived here in Germany they were \ndiscriminated and the Germans avoided them, didnt want to talk to them, \ndidnt want to help them, having thousands of prejudices (and some still \ngot) and so these people sticked together and founded their own societies \nand so we simply found out that \"we\" are the problem not them and since \nthen a lot has changed. What I just told you is something you already learn \nin 7th grade in Germany, we have thousand of programs for better \nintegration and we abolished tuitions to give everyone equal chances, \nbecause our ethos is \"work hard and you can make it!\" (but even here in \nEurope it is not a secret that the system isnt perfect either and that \nwealthier kids still got way higher chances to become successful).. \n\nSo you have to ask yourself how your \"black\" community got there in the \nfirst place, which obstacles they have to meet probably everyday in their \nlife and then if it isnt understandable that after all these decades or \neven centuries they are just tired and just know \"becoming a pimp or a drug \ndealer is the only way to become something in this country, because all the \nother doors are closed for a person like me\" (principles of evolution and \nnatural selection: Every life form searches his space where he can survive).\n\nIntegration and Discrimination are selffullfilling prophecies. You point at \nsomeone and tell the others \"look! He is bad, lazy and a criminal!\" and \nthis person will encounter a lot of obstacles in his life which will make \nit harder for him to be successful, maybe one of him will become president, \nthe other a rapper, the other one an athlete and one a CEO, but the vast \nmajority wont make it because of these sick obstacles and they will fail \nand in the end they will have to live by the welfare system and/or becoming \ncriminal and you will stand there again, pointing at them saying \"told'ya!\".\n\nIn Germany the most racist people are the ones living in the poorest parts. \nThe \"native\" Germans blame the other nationalities for their misery and the \nGermans with another national background blame the \"natives\" and through \nthis hatred towards each other this shit goes on and on and on.

Europeans I meet abroad are usually unaware of this, and tend to \nmake arrogant and ignorant remarks not dissimilar to yours. \n\nSecondly, it's usually only white people who never lived in multiracial \ncommunities that blame crime on poverty.

In 2011, there were more cases of Whites killing Whites than \nthere were Blacks killing Blacks. However, the mainstream media obsesses \nover Black on Black violence and rarely mentions the problem of White on \nWhite violence.\n\nThese statistics have not led to a media outcry about the problem of White \non White crime or the unique pathology of the White community. Nor has the \nWhite community stood up to demand change in their community like the Black \ncommunity does when trying to tackle instances of Black on Black crime.\n\nMost White people don\u2019t kill White people. Yet media pundits, from Fox \nNews\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly to CNN\u2019s Don Lemon, have no problem using the phrase \n\u201cBlack on Black violence\u201d despite the fact that most Black people don\u2019t \nkill Black people.\n\nWhen the news talks about gang-related deaths, they treat it as an almost \nexclusively Black problem. However, according to the Bureau of Justice \nStatistics, for the period of 1980 to 2008, a majority (53.3 percent) of \ngang homicides were committed by White offenders, and the majority of gang \nhomicide victims (56.5 percent) were White.\n\nWhen was the last time you\u2019ve seen on the news, discussions about a \nWhite-gang problem?\n\nCrimes committed by White people are explained as deviations of the \nindividual but have nothing to do with race, but crimes committed by Blacks \nor Latino\u2019s are somehow attributed to race. Gang-bangers from South Chicago \nhave somehow become a symbol that Black men are to be feared, but you don\u2019t \nget the same fear that one could attach to the brutal murders committed by \nNeo-Nazi skinheads.\n\nAccording to statistics from the Justice Department, White men are more \nlikely to kill than any other racial group. When it comes to how and why \npeople kill, Black men do, in fact, outnumber Whites in gun-related \nhomicides, but especially drug-related offenses. However, White men top the \nlist in most all other categories.\n\nWhen the Bureau of Justice Statistics collected homicidal rates from 1980 \nto 2008, they found that compared to Blacks, Whites were more likely to \nkill children, the elderly, family members, and their significant others. \nThey commit more sex-related crimes, gang related crimes, and are more \nlikely to kill at their places of employment.\n\nSo why does America still perpetuate the lie of Black criminality?\ufeff",

M. you are right , there are people that should not be allowed to \nhave a gun , and that encompasses people of all race and nationalities, but \nthe point was not that, the point was that if gun ownership is so prevalent \nin the white community and it is not frowned upon then it should be the \nsame in the African American community as well, where they are allowed to \nown and carry fire arms also with the same equality as the other.",

It is the Obama administration that decided \nrecently to add a second question about race on a form 4473... are you \nHispanic?\n\nThey ask you if you are Hispanic in the question that is right after the \nquestion that asks, \"what race are you?\". So they ask what race you are not \nonce, but twice. If you lie on either question you can be sent to prison \nfor the crime of perjury.\n\nThen, after answering these questions, the gun dealer is requried to gall \nthe ATF and tell them what the potential buyer said on the form. Based on \nwhat is on the form, the ATF decides if the person should get a gun or not.\n\nI do not understand what the NRA has to do with Travon's inability to get a \ngun. The NRA has NEVER asked for a law that gave preference to race. There \nis no mention of race on the NRA membership application form and, unlike \nthe ATF and the Obama administration, the NRA does not discriminate against \nany race.   Travon Martin could have applied for NRA membership if he \nwished and would gladly have been accepted as a member.\n\nTravon Martin was prohibited by both Florida State and also Federal law \nfrom owning a handgun.\ufeff",
