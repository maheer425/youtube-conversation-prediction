Well duh, offcourse would the Shooting Brake have more room. \nWhat were you trying to sell here? You should compare the back room with \nany other luxury Wagon/Estate. If you would have been honest you would have \nsaid that the Shooting Brake has the tiniest amount of room of them all \n(Audi/BMW/Merc E class, etcetera)!  There's a reason for that, but that's \nnot the gist of this reply. It's your dishonest nonsensical comparison, and \nin general one heck of a biased, no-critics whatsoever, way of presentation.\n\nIf you would have had any integrity in this review you would have mentioned \nthe tiny cheap 7\"nav screen (for this luxury category). You should have \ndemonstrated the lack of space for luggage compared to other wagons. And \nyou should have demonstrated and mentioned the lack of height for the \npassengers in the rear seat. And finally you would have mentioned and \ndemonstrated the lack of visibility around you and through the back of the \nwindow.\n\nThe proper conclusion would be that one would buy one heck of a cool wagon \nfor quite some money after some needed upgrades, but you have to give up \nquite a few basic things:\n- significant (!) loss of space for the luggage-height\n- you'd have the smallest luggage space compared with other midsize wagons\n- rear seat height (a six foot person is going to have a significant \nproblem)\n- visibility around you and through he back window\n- cheap tiny nav screen.\n\nI've testdriven this thing myself and that's how I found out. The coolness \nand driving characteristics are undisputable but in a review you gotta \nmention the negatives you know.\ufeff",
