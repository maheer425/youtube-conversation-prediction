            "text": "I actually discovered K-Pop by typing \"Sexy Asian Women\" Into the search \nwindow. I'm a musician and I have to say that all this K-Pop music is kinda \ngeneric, full of plaegerized licks of American music.  I am kind of \nembarrassed about the way that the USA has influenced the world. I like to \nsee people being who they are, not changing themselves to fit in. I don't \nlike seeing the western influence over power the Asian culture. They have a \nreally cool heritage and culture and all that is getting flushed down the \npipes for profit in the American mainstream.\n\n60 years ago when Jimmi Hendrix raped the holy crap out of a Fender Strat \nwith every knob on his Marshall cranked up to ten, he changed the course of \nmusic. We are still listening to his legacy today. When Stevie Wonder \nstarted using one of those new-fangled electronical synthesizer keyboards, \nwe will never be the same again.  The top slot in music goes to the \ninnovators.\n\nEuropean music uses a 12 tone scale. Asian music uses a 10 tone scale. I \nlistened to some 'traditional' Asian music on YT and loved it. It is \nbeautiful. On the other hand that wooden flute and zuki acoustic \ninstruments get a little boring . I discovered \"12 Girls Band\" , they use \ntraditional Asian instruments, but play 12 tone scale on them.  Profitable, \nI'm sure, but it is a perversion of sorts.\n\nIf you're still with me, I would like to see one of these girl bands order \nsome custom made modern instruments with ten tone scale. Hire a 70 year old \nChinese women to teach them what to do with them and Voila`  .. A new music \nform is reborn.  Think of what will happen to metal music if Johnny Chang \nshows up with a solid body electric guitar that has ten frets instead of \ntwelve.    \n\nIf the right person reads this, they are going to make a butt-full of \nmoney.\ufeff",
