The brother in law cannot see them and I understand that he \ncan't because he doesn't believe.  The difference is that as far as I know, \nthere are 7 billion people alive today who have never SEEN and some of them \nstill believe.  That is totally different than this film. Ray builds the \nfield because he hears the voice and immediately is rewarded for his work \nand gets to see the players. I believed for many years and was never \nrewarded, nor did I play catch with Jesus or God, nor did they tell me to \nbuild anything.  All they left me with is a book filled with murder and \nhate and unjust penalties for earthly mistakes. I think if the voice had \nsaid, \"You must build it, or go to hell\" the movie might have had a \ndifferent feel. Please go read your bible, alone. We've all seen it, and \nbelieve me, we don't not believe blindly. \ufeff",

            "text": "+LiberalLogic IsAnOxymoron I don't understand your second collection of \nbabble. 7 billion, NSA, super powers etc. You may marvel all you want but \nit is not that difficult. If my eternal sentence was based on whether I \nbelieved in a God, then that God would tell me so. Very personally. He \nwould not tell some Muslim, or Mega Pastor, or Catholic Priest, and then \nsay, \"Well, I hope those who don't get to see me, believe Fr. Joe who now \nknows.\" So, again, if anyone had seen God, so too would I. If Fr. Joe saw \nGod, that is his business. If I was supposed to know or believe that, I \ncertainly would not be expected to take Fr. Joe's word as he also claims to \nturn bread and wine into the body and blood of a 2000 year old man who \nisn't even cemented as having existed.\n\nFunny how someone rose from the dead, and appeared to many a multitude, \nwhile the dead rose and walked out their graves... and yet there is no \nwriting of this anywhere. None. Nowhere. It is not history, it's story. \nMuch like the fairy Godmother who turns the pumpkin into a carriage, being \nthat it is in a book filled with magic and unrealistic miracles, I take it \nas a story. Not history. So, unbelievable as my Super Powers may be, I \nsimply do not need to talk to 7 billion to know that Cinderella is a fairy \ntale. Even if one or two or 1.5 billion said they have seen the fairy God \nMother turn a pumpkin into a carriage, I would not believe it without being \nshown. If I did, then I should get a huge stamp on my forehead that says \nIDIOT. I choose to not get labeled with that for my belief in the \nunbelievable. ",

You are correct in that assumption. Am I judging on the fact that I \n\"think\" he doesn't exist? No, the God in the bible DOES NOT exist. So, if I \nknow he doesn't exist, I can easily make the assumption that no one has \nseen that which does not exist.\n\nThe bible was written by men, human beings, and so they gave God \"human \ntraits\" like he's angry, jealous and vindictive. He gave you free will but \nif you use it to not believe you will burn for eternity. That is not free \nwill.\n\nIf we go to breakfast and I say, \"You have free will! I give you this great \ngift so you may order freely from the menu! Anything you like... BUT if you \norder anything else besides the Moons-over-my Hammy, then I will shoot you \nin the face.\" Is that free will? Of course not. I have forced you to eat \nthe Moons, or die.    God would know that if I know anything in this life \nit is not to trust the word of another human unless they are my best friend \nor family who has given me no reason to not believe. I grew up in the \nchurch. Heavy into it and believe me, the Church ONLY gave me lies, fed me \nbullshit, and hid what would make me question. I don't know the men who \nwrote the bible but I know it has been changed, books edited, added, \nremoved, re-written. A book of prophesy come true when the prophesy came \nfirst, then the second half of the book (where the prophesy is fulfilled), \nis written with knowledge of the prophesy. Of course Jesus comes from the \nhouse of David cause the Old Testament says he will. That is not divine, \nit's a joke.\n\nGod wouldn't come, author some crap, then leave, then return as man, suffer \nfor a few hours, claim he was the world's savior, die, then rise and author \nsome more crap, then leave and hope his creations would just read the book \nfilled with rape, incest, murder and improbable impossibilities and believe \nthat an all good God loves and adores them but will send you to an eternity \nin flames for 80 bad years on Earth, in which his little devil boy Satan \ntempted you non-stop throughout your life. It's beyond faith. That's \nstupidity.\n\nGod did not talk to me, or you, or anyone else. If they think he did, then \nthey can keep that between them and their God because he obviously didn't \nwant to talk to me. I hope I made that perfectly clear. I am saying they \nhave not seen God, nor do they speak on his behalf, nor do they do his work \nor know his ways.\n\nIf God exists, then here are some facts. 1. He does not write books or tell \npeople to write for him.  2. He does not do stupid things like create two \nlights in the sky, the greater to light the day, and lessor to light the \nnight BEFORE he creates the Sun and the Moon. 3. He is God, and can snap \nhis fingers and forgive all mankind... does not need himself to be a blood \nsacrifice so come to Earth, disappear for 18 years and return to start his \nministry for 3 years, suffer for maybe a few hours and die a fairly quick \ndeath and then rise again to say hi to old buddies and say he will return \nshortly then just take off for 2000 years and 4. He is so far beyond our \nhuman comprehension that it is funny that we try to comprehend. ",

It needs a little help.\n\nSo, in the context of legal web marketing, \"great content\" really means \ncontent that people like *and\" want to share, link to and otherwise \npublicize.\n\nThat's the part that a lot of folks forget.\n\nIf you believe that your \"stuff\" is worthy, but it's not getting found, \nspend some time getting it in front of people who can (and are able) to \nhelp promote it.\ufeff",
