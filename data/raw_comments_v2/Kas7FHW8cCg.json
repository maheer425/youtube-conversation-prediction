So I decided to to watch Cart. And now, I regret it \nbecause I was watching the movie in the middle of the night and I just \ncan't stop crying(it's 5am rn). Cart is a really great movie which taught \nme not to give up no matter what challenges you're going to face. At the \nend of the movie, I was pretty much calm(not really) but as soon as the \ncredit starts..... *cried a river* \nP/s: you guys should really watch the movie. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. \ufeff",
