Also the fact that there is still a lot \nof stereotyping in this world, and many still see women as febble, weak, \nand incapable of being able to beat men, unfortunately that is not true but \nyet people still hold it as fact, that is also why there are so few female \nvillains too. Now the reason for why they are predominantly white is simply \nbecause there is still a level of racism in this world. So to sum this up, \nwhat we need is to stop stereotyping and raceism., and have a more diverse \nfan base. Oh and superman is over rated and too powerful. \ufeff",

Or Harley, or Zaaz, or anyone else in that \ngroup who has proven to be a mass murderer, incorrigible, 10/10 will escape \nto kill again. \n\nThere's something to be said for the desire to rehabilitate rather than \npenalize, and I'm all for that, but not at the cost of innocents. The \nJoker's life, I believe, has great value, and if he could be convinced to \nchange his ways and submit to the law of the land, that would be \ngreat...but everyone knows he's never ever going to do that. And in waiting \nfor him to do that, Gotham is allowing him to kill more totally innocent \npeople. \n\nI value the lives of uncaring serial killers, but I care about the lives of \ninnocent civilians a heck of a lot more. \n\nTherefore, I strongly disagree with Batman's repeated refusal to kill the \nJoker, which I feel if he really valued the lives of innocents all that \nmuch, he would do. \ufeff",
