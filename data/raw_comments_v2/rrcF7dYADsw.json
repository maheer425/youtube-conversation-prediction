Whoever \nended the series believing certain questions were unanswered simply did not \npay enough attention.\n\nStrictly on how the show ends (spoilers): Jack detonates a hydrogen bomb in \na magnetic field area thing, which causes two parallel dimensions: one \nwhere the survivors crash, and another where they don't. Its later revealed \nthat the one they don't crash is Purgatory. In Purgatory, Charlie has a \nnear-death experience, causing him to recall his life on the island. He and \nDesmond then go and make the other survivors have similar revelations and \ngroup them to a Church. Realizing their connection and past life, they are \nsent to Heaven (certain people aren't there due to mistakes, however). \n\n\nOn the island, everything that happened did happen. It wasn't fake. They \ncrashed, there were smoke monsters and immortal beings, the Others, etc. \nThe main antagonist, the Man in Black, is trying to escape to spread chaos \nand evil, but cannot due so until a human kills the Good, Jacob. He manages \nto do this, but fails to escape before a new \"Jacob\" (this being Hurley) is \nchosen (which is why the island had those survivors crash land, and why it \nhad them return after they left). Some of the remaining survivors escape on \na plane while Jack sacrifices himself to ensure they get off the island \nsafely. He dies where he woke up in the very first episode. \n\n\nPeople don't like the ending because of the religious route they took, but \nmy God, Science vs. Religion was one of the main themes across all 6 \nseasons. They had countless religious imagery (Psalms, Mary, etc.). It \nwanted you to question what was real and what was supernatural. \n\n\nThis isn't the best of explanations as I'm exclusively explaining the last \nseason. The rest of the season adds a lot more lore and mystery to the \nScience and Faith the island shows through DHARMA, the Heart of the Island, \netc.",

The revelations added \nclarification, explanation for the why and the how, but very few ever \nreally changed the direction of the story (look of it from the perspective \nof the characters, there were mysteries that they didn't know were there \nand they didn't know the resolution of, however, it they were vital to the \njourney of the characters and their story then they would have been aware. \nthis isn't a murder case set of mysteries, these are world-building \nmysteries - for the audience, not for the characters). \n\nThe plot was a non-linear narrative. The very nature of that means that \nthere are going to be questions and eventually answers, simply because at \nthe point that these questions arise the entire story has not yet been told \nand the audience is seeing ahead in the story. \n\nWhat exactly were you expecting? A singular, all-important answer at the \nconclusion of the series that would act in the very same way as the \nconclusion to the ending of the sixth sense? That would never be the case \nbecause it isn't an over-arching mystery and in even the sixth sense, that \nrevelation only clarifies certain moments throughout the film, adding a \ndifferent meaning to them, but it does not at all change the main plot of \nthe film which involves the boy and don't at all play a role in the \nresolution to the story about that boy.\n\nLOST was always a mystery show about a group of survivors after a horrific \nplane crash and their experiences both before the island and on the island. \nIt is a mystery show - that is its genre, it is a story about... - that is \nits story.  \n\n\"Why do I have this key in my pocket? What is this key for? It must be \nimportant to my story? Oh wait, this key belongs to my car and I must have \nat some stage picked it up and put it in my pocket.\" Suddenly the great big \nmystery, spewing with all sorts of possibilities, is revealed and now \nsuddenly mundane. Yet it built suspense because it was told in a backwards \nnarrative, whereas if events were followed in order and the keys were put \nin the pocket and later on the character found them and was confused \nmomentarily - there'd be no suspense, it would simply be an unnoticed \nthing. But that is what a mystery narrative is, they are either looking \nfrom the outside in and actively investigating (a murder plot where the \ncharacters are actively involved), or its a twisted narrative whereby the \naudience has to do their own homework while the characters engage in their \nown story/stories.\n\nBut to say the mysteries aren't important is ridiculous. They are the \nexperience, they are the missing pieces in the story later clicked back \ninto place.\n\nLost's sixth season provided a lot of clarification where upon rewatching \nthe series a lot of events suddenly take on new meaning - much as with the \nsixth sense and its final moments, but take away those revelations and the \nfundamental story doesn't change - it remains exactly what is was before \nand your thoughts on it remain exactly what they were before you were told \nto think any differently of it.\n\nI just don't understand how people can watch a mystery narrative and then \ndismiss the mysteries once they're revealed as not being important. They \nare part of the experience.",

The last three seasons \nare concise, consistent, and have momentum that the first three seasons \n(and less consistent) seasons had. Between the second season and first half \nof the third season, the series saw its largest drop in audience and failed \nto get nominations at the Emmys. The 4th, 5th, and 6th seasons of the show \nwere all nominated for best series, which hadn't happened since the first \nseason. The story did not change, it just switched gears when it was \nawarded shorter seasons of 12-16 episodes and began driving the story \ntowards its conclusion rather than spinning its wheels.
