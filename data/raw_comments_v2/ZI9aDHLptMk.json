This is a very drastic \nchange to minimum wage right now ($8.10) and wouldn't have some of the \npositive effects of a slight increase. If they succeed in this increase \nmany small businesses will go out of business, therefore making less jobs, \ntherefore creating more poverty. Prices will go up drastically to \ncompensate for the wages the business has to pay there employees. Only huge \nbusinesses such as McDonald's and Walmart will survive. Also, as prices go \nup, so will taxes. This is only a fraction of the negative effects raising \nminimum wage will cause. Sometimes things are not as black and white as it \nseems.

BPA (the \nbank in Andorra) actually *expanded* in the wake of the crisis and only *this \nyear* suffered from a money-laundering scandal. It had *nothing* to do with \nany banking crisis. You're just grabbing names of banks that have failed \nabout which you have absolutely no clue (this is called \"a pattern\").\n\n\nOf course, on planet earth (another area you are clearly unfamiliar with) \nthere was *never* a time when Lehman Brothers \"neglect[ed] all risk [to] \npursue personal bonuses and short-term profit at the expense of all else\". \nBe honest - are you really another economist doing a parody of leftist \nignorance and economic incompetence? If you are you're doing a *fantastic* \njob. In case that's not what's going on, it's worthwhile to point out that \nLehman Brothers engaged in investment activities that made perfect sense \nand worked fine before the Federal Reserve flooded the economy with \nliquidity in the mid-2000s. As is always the case, an influx of such \nliquidity (whether from actual wealth creation or the bogus money printing \nthat occurred in this case) results in the expansion of investment \nactivities to the next risk tier - that is, if you have $100 to \nlend/invest, it goes to the best creditors and if you then have another \n$100 to lend/invest the first-tier borrowers are satisfied and it goes to \nthe next best creditors and so on (this is pretty basic stuff). \nUnfortunately, when such resources are artificially created an \nunsustainable bubble is created (in investment areas such as the stock \nmarket, the banking sector and real estate) and the risk signals in the \nmarket are distorted. The resources that make those next tier borrowers \nlook viable don't really exist but the impact on risk pricing of the \nartificial liquidity makes those risks appear viable (and, if the bubble \ncould be maintained indefinitely they actually would be - those investing \nin such risks initially were highly successful, it was those at the end \nthat got burned). When the resources were proved to be artificial, it was \nimpossible to extricate from those earlier decisions.\n\n\nThe federal government made matters tremendously worse in several ways, \nmost notably with the maintenance of an artificial market in mortgages by \nFannie and Freddie, that could not have existed without their imprimatur. \nBut the Fed's shift to mark to market also was disastrous as banks with \nmortgage backed securities that were performing admirably and presented no \nrisk to the banks financial condition were suddenly unusable in reserves. \nThis killed Provident Bankshares for example, and led to their purchase by \nM&T Bank.\n\n\nNone of this is really speculation. It's not anyone;s fault but your own \nthat you didn't get the memo and seem to enjoy demonstrating glaring \nignorance of economics, history, banking, research and reality.",

No harm; \nno foul - perhaps all that was required was clarification.\n\nWhile, in theory, \"[a] basic minimum income with no strings attached \n[might] allow people to have something to live on and allow them to still \nhave the ability to go find work\". it does not work in practice. The huge \ndisincentive to work has already been amply demonstrated and the absence of \nany such \"basic income\" has never been and can never be a bar to someone \nhaving the ability to seek employment. That you collect a retirement that \nyou've earned as part of the employment contract you had with the military \nis in no way comparable. And while I concede that the vast majority of \nthose living at or below the minimum income at any given time would seek \nemployment or schooling, that is the case regardless of whether there is a \nprovided minimum income and the entrenched poverty that such a system \ncreates among the very real minority who will not seek employment or \nschooling if provided the means to live without doing so becomes an ever \nincreasing problem.\n\nAgain, to be more accurate, horses are a completely invalid and absolutely \nuseless example. Horses (again, a homogeneous commodity) can in absolutely \nno way be compared to the entirely adaptive and ever-changing nature of \nlabor services. Calling it merely \"absolutely terrible\" was being kind on \nmy part. It's worthless at best and disingenuous at worst. Horses are \nmerely a resource with a few very limited applications. Human labor can \n(obviously) be applied to literally every one of the the millions of jobs \nthat have come into existence and countless more that come into existence \nregularly as technology increases. The Luddite myth that *any* kind of \ntechnology can ever put people in the aggregate out of work has been \nutterly and completely debunked. Again, for every cashier replaced by \nautomated self-checkout station, more jobs are created designing, building \nand servicing those machines and more other jobs we cannot even imagine. If \nthe theory that such automation could create permanent unemployment were \neven the tiniest bit credible than the invention of the tractor would have \ndevastated the economy, the human workforce and the entire world would have \ncollapsed in the early 20th century.\n\nFederal reserve manipulation is a very real, but completely unrelated to \nthe topic, problem.\n\nNo \"studies\" exist showing the \"success\" of the basic minimum income. the \nclosest real world examples are the hugely costly SSI program in the US, \nthe economically draining program in France that created a *huge* poverty \ntrap and is steadily helping to kill their economy (along with high minimum \nwages, serious related employment problems, etc., the programs often cited \nas part of the \"Scandinavian miracle\" myth, etc.\n\nPerhaps the problem, is that there does not exist a libertarian (unless you \nmean a \"libertarian socialist\" which in the US has exactly the opposite \nconnotation) that absurdly believes that the elimination of money is either \npossible or desirable, let alone that the (far more fantasy than science \nfiction) Star Trek dynamic is even remotely credible.",

I collect money every month as someone who is retired from the Army. \n Guess what, it has not stopped me from seeking/gaining employment or going \nto school.

I do find it odd, even perhaps objectionable, that \"certain \nlibertarians\" attempt to retain the designation while actively advocating \nsocialism (the governmental guarantee of a minimum income level). I also \nfind it odd that a reasonable person would not see as many problems with \nsuch a plan as with the existing system. It not merely does nothing to \naddress the disincentives to work built into the current system; it \nexacerbates them still further unless, of course, you are suggesting that \nsuch a minimum level be set at a threshold at which it is extremely \ndifficult to live on. Nor does it eliminate the bureaucracy as government \nflunkies will still disburse funds, face the massive fraud \nincentives/challenges, exercise governmental decision making power over the \neconomic actions of individuals, etc.\n\nAs an alternative to the existing system, a case *might* be made for such a \nprogram. As an alternative to the free market solution, it's a disaster.\n\nYour next point is a straw man I don't disagree with Ron Paul. Understand, \nthe crowding out effect of government charity over private charity did not \nhappen overnight. Certainly, there would have to be a weaning process that \nallows a stepped shift back to the more responsible and effective system, \nbut the end result is a vastly more efficient and effective means of \ndealing with real need. I am not an an Ayn Rand disciple, nor do I suggest \nthat such a structure needs to be or ever was \"communitarian\" albeit if \nfree individuals choose to live communally that is detrimental neither to \nfreedom nor to the economy.\n\nAnd, yes, technology replaces a lot of jobs, but, inevitably and without \nexception, technology ultimately creates more and higher paying jobs. The \nhorse example is absolutely terrible (albeit it is flung around \nall-too-frequently). Horses are a relatively homogeneous commodity (in the \neconomic sense), No matter what market conditions exist, horses will always \nbe horses. Labor services are *entirely* different. They can, and do, \nchange radically over time. Three centuries ago, the vast majority of labor \nservices were employed in agricultural work. By a century ago, it had \nshifted to industrial work. By the time we were born, the shift to services \nwas well underway. Labor can, and invariably *does* adapt.

I haven't chosen a side yet on this issue, \nbecause both have good arguments, but if we had to traduce all those \ncarefully redacted arguments (in this and other discussions I have read) \ninto their simplest form, then they would be something like this:\n\n-Pro raise in minimum wage: Let us have the raise so we can have more \nspending power and better quality of life. Business owners should absorb \nthe raise because they would otherwise be hoarding money, thus breaking the \nsystem. In that case, the money that would go into your sweet new ride or \nthat big vacation your were planning would then go to the plates where I \nfeed my children, which I feel its fair.\n\n-Anti raise in minimum wage: Let us pay you for what you are worth. If you \nbecome really productive we will pay you more, but don't ask us to give you \na set amount just because. If you don't have a highly valuable skillset \nthen don't expect a highly valuable wage. This is so simple yet people \ndon't want to understand it because they are looking at it from an \nemotional stand point. \n\nThese are the two main sides, but what about the third one? That third one \nare the ones who control everything by setting the prices of raw \nmaterials/ingredients. What if minimum wage is eliminated but raw materials \nget so expensive that employers have to fire people anyway, causing a \ndisaster? On the other hand what if minimum wage were raised and raw \nmaterials somehow get cheaper? Will they keep asking for raises even though \nit may be too risky? Will it become a vicious circle? You see, this is \nwhere both points of view clash and cancel each other. There a just too \nmany variables...\ufeff",

Not only to the employee it is, but \nalso the employer. Anyone who opens a restaurant has several tens of \nthousand of dollars.
