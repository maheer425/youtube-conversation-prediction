But it's \nnot \"not worth it\" to spend the money to fix up your original wheels if \nthey're something worthwhile (like those original 16in C4 wheels Larry had \nwere). Could have actually been a very interesting video if only for the \nsake of education on the process of blasting the finish off the wheels and \nthen repairing kerb rash. \n\nFor you garage wrenchheads out there that want to fix some Kerbing and \naren't afraid to get your hands dirty, check out spot putty. If it's a \nsmall bit of rash you can actually strip the paint of just that bit of \nwheel, apply the spot putty and hardening agent, sand to smooth and then \nrepaint with the correct paint (on almost every german car it's Wurst \nSilver paint) take about an hour of your life but well worth it. \n\nIf your wheel is rashed badly, just strip the entire wheel and use the spot \nputty and sandpaper to get the entire wheel nice and uniform. After that \npick whatever paint + clear combo you want. Use a spray nozzle to keep your \nspray even sand it down between coats, especially fine sanding between \nclears.\ufeff",

If I wanted to fill with nitrogen I'd be looking at $20 + \nwhatever they charge to top you up however often it needs it - for \nsomething I'm not going to notice at all even when driving much harder than \nI do on the road - why bother?\n\nAdd my personal experience to all the literature that says you can't tell \nor measure the difference in any meaningful way, plus my scientific \nknowledge - well I'm very satisfied that my opinion is not ignorant.\n\nMaybe it's useful in a Nissan GTR, maybe a better driver would notice the \ndifference - I don't know, my car is quick, but it's not anywhere near GTR \nquick, and I'm a very average enthusiast level driver.\n\nLook, I've had this exact debate with my local tyre guy as he's convinced \nthe product he is selling does his customers some good though he has \nnothing but personal anecdotes to back it up - but I honestly cannot tell \nthe difference, and objective studies also say the same thing - so when \npeople ask me about it, I tell them not to bother with it, it's a waste of \nmoney.",
