He was implicated in a big \nscandal on Tumblr back in March in which a bunch of victims of sexual \nabuse, coercion, and manipulation by YouTubers in a position of power (most \nnotably Tom Milsom and Alex Day) felt the need to come forward and tell \ntheir stories. Luke in particular had a number of claims brought against \nhim, the links to which are listed here if anyone is interested: \nhttp://unpleasantmyles.tumblr.com/post/79455706244/heres-the-post-olga-made-about-tom-milsom-and\n\nIn any case, I still love Shake A Booty, and I'll remind myself that it is \ndistributed by Hank, not Luke. But dammit, I do wish that it wasn't \nassociated with someone with so little regard for women and those with whom \nhe is intimate, y'know?\ufeff",
