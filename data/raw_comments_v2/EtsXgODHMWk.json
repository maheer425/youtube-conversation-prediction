I understand that a \ncamera capturing images at 1 trillion frames per second is actually \ncapturing events one trillionth of that second after they happened. So my \nQ1 is does this mean that even a high concentrated beam of laser is \nscattering photons away from its trajectory so they may reach the camera \nand form the image. Q2 is if it does then does this mean the actual packet \nof beam of laser traveling through space relative to observer is \nbigger/longer/brighter/has more energy or anything than it actually appears \nin the camera, as camera is capturing only the photons its receiving and \nmaking picture out of it. and my last question Q3 is if you fire a single \nphoton, no beam, or packet of photons or light but single particle of light \nthrough absolute vacuum in a pitch dark environment, even then would camera \ncapture anything. If yes then how is this happening as photon is not \nchanging path then what is creating the picture. If not then does this mean \nthat the camera captures images from photons reflected/refracted from some \nobject or scattered from light source and in this process loses some \ninformation as it can capture and process light of certain wavelength.     \ufeff",

            "text": "Light has a speed of propagation. In vacuum and air it's about 300,000 \nkm/s. A camera has a rate of image acquisition. This one's is 1,000,000,000 \nimages/s. As you can see, the units are different, so trying to compare the \ntwo is meaningless. This camera's rate of imaging has nothing to do \nwhatsoever with the speed of light. It captures whatever light has arrived \nat the image sensor at the moment the sensor is taking the exposure. In \nother words, it would work just as well if the light traveled 10x slower, \nor 10x faster.\n\nIt'd help if the snarky commenters were, well, less snarky. We're not all \nprivy to good education. Just because I was taught this stuff in grade \nschool doesn't make it so for everyone. Now, if Jesusisyhwh was taught this \nand ignored it, scorn would be well-deserved.",
