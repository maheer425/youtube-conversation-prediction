At the time I saw this movie, while I \nliked it alright, I felt a hint of fear for the direction of the Marvel \nmovie line.\n\nEven when I first saw it, the Avengers always felt a bit too focused on \nit's humour. What was a slight winning edge for the movies prior was \ngetting out of hand and suddenly Avengers felt more like a string of \nsuperhero skits that began and ended with parts of a movie. There were a \nfew of the other movies that had the issue before (Thor), but it was the \nAvengers that punctuated that change in shift. When I saw this, that growth \nhad only become more dominant in the movie. I mean, as much as I like it, \nthis movie was fucking *dumb!*\n\nI was afraid that this would only become increasingly dominant. Suddenly \nengulfing the whole experience by the time we got to Avengers 2 to the \npoint where the plot had become as thin and meaningless as possible for the \nsake of seeing the Marvel all-stars goofing off... It was a good thing that \nMarvel flipped sides before that happened. Avengers 2 felt like just the \nright equalizer that had a good balance of comedy and story again, much \nlike I saw Iron man 1 as.\n\nNow with that clear from my mind, I've finally let myself soften up to \nGuardians. That last border where it still teeters on being ludicrously \ndumb and still manages to not be distracting... for the most part.\ufeff",
