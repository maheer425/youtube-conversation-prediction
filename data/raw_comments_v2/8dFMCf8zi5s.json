My stomach was in excruciating pain. I \nliterally felt like it was burning through my stomach. The pain was \nindescribable. I forced myself to throw it up and it ended up burning my \nsinus, my lips, my nostrils, my eyes. Never again will I ever take on a \ndare to eat a raw ghost pepper. It was the longest 20 minutes of my life. \nThe next day when I was sitting in a long calculus lecture class, all I \ncould think was -- this beats the 20 minutes of torture from the give ghost \npeppers I ate. It was an experience I'll never forget.\ufeff",
