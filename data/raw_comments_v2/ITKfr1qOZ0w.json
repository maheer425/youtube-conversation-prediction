Popular showing media showing more men than women as main \ncharacters have nothing to do with oppression. They just want to \nappeal to a target demographic, the bigger the demographic the better. Man \nOf Steel and Avengers 2 appeal to a mostly male demographic while Twilight \nand 50 Shades Of Grey appeal to a mostly female one.\n\n3. Why do you even care about something that trivial?\n Will that make the world any better?\nOf course not. It doesn't matter if the majority of the world's leaders are \nmale or female, what matters is if they are capable of solving the world \nproblems.\n\n4. I know that women in major parts of the world are treated poorly and \nthey need all the feminism they can handle.

The state of identity and \nidentity politics (especially in America) has developed into such an absurd \ndistortion of ordinary life that the class which is supposed to be on the \ntop of the \"Pyramid of Privilege\", if you will, are a parody of themselves. \nWhich behaviours or signs of difference must a straight white man suppress \nto fit the expectations of his peers, black and white women, black men, \nqueer people, and every other identity supposedly under his thumb?\n\nJust a thought - and it's particularly noticeable to me as I'm Irish and \nnever experienced privilege over others, except maybe from all that cheap \nslave-labour clothing and Chinese gadgets... but as I prepare to integrate \nin America, I'm the white devil!",

I think dealing \nwith oppressed ethnic groups is always hard because people who have \nsuffered from this oppression might be offended no matter what you do, \nbecause since individuals have different life stories... while some of them \nmight relate to the character, others will see him exactly as the \nstereotype they have spent their entire lives trying to deconstruct.\n\nThe point is that, in the end, both approaches are equally valid in my \nopinion, and though maybe this channel can't cover them all, I think it is \na valid contribution.\n\nWhile I do believe that black people shouldn't be depicted as \"thugs\" all \nthe time, I think that \"silencing the thugs\" in ALL media is just as \ncontroversial. As some have already mentioned here, millions of people DO \nrelate to the character and, with that in mind, I love the fact that they \nprove you CAN be a thug with PhD in literature, for example, that \nexpressing your culture is not incompatible with being highly educated. \n\nMost of the time, you have to mimic the rich-white-heterosexual-male \nstereotype to be taken seriously in an intellectual environment. Gays \nshouldn't be flamboyant, women should be sober, blacks shouldn't use the \nlanguage they learned in the ghetto (or any other differences that the \ndominant group doesn't like seeing in others). And yes, that goes too to \nthe red neck you mentioned. Anyone who has been to college as part of these \n\"minorities\" (who, in fact, are not minorities at all) has been through it.\n\n(Of course it doesn't mean that ALL gay people are indeed flamboyant or ALL \nblack people relate to the \"thug\" culture. Actually, no matter what group \nyou belong to, first... you are an individua and individuals are different. \nEven if you are rich, male, heterossexual and white, you won't relate to \nall other rich, straight, white males.)\n\nThough Wisecrack fails to give voice to ALL these groups, I do think it is \nnice that they are helping push these boundaries further.

Not trying to invoke authority, just \nrelaying why I have much to say on this. Race, culture, and Volk/Folk is \nimportant to me. I don't fuck around or take sides.\n\nWhat's \"grossly offensive\"? I'd rather you asked one of the handful of \nAfrican-Americans who agreed with my initial instinct about this video. \nOnly they can tell you what it means. *Granted:* We're getting into the \nrealm of emotions here and pretty much giving people the right to be \noffended by anything, but there's an actual basis in reality to this, and \nit's our job to figure out what's a genuine social complaint.\nIf this video was in a different social context, where the vast majority of \nAfrican-Americans depicted in \"white\" literature and media weren't \nconstantly coloured by destructive stereotypes and didn't teach young \nAfrican-American kids that all they're allowed to be is one of this narrow \narray of dysfunctional Human, *then this depiction would be harmless*. Yet \nit's the only African-American I've seen in the handful of videos from this \nchannel, and he's a fucking street hustler.\nI think Peggy MacIntosh's \"White Privilege\" concept is really flawed, but \nthere's some truth in there to be redeemed. We may casually write or watch \na black character \"being black\" and our lack of social context won't give \nus the eyes to see content that could be harmful, and the African-Americans \nare starting to forget what derides them because they've been brow-beaten \nwith transgressive depictions and role models of themselves for 40 years \nnow. Even on BET, the best you can hope to look up to is some Uncle Tom... \nwhy do you think, despite the shallowness and backstabbing, \nAfrican-Americans are FANATICAL about Barack Obama? That's the closest \nthing they've got to a progress and intelligent role model who isn't \nspeaking from a standpoint of being oppressed.\nThis is not a good climate for Americans of any colour. Y'all are living on \ntop of each other and the continents ye came from don't want ye back - the \nUnited States is your home. You should be caring for it and each other in \nthat spirit. If you were two neighbouring countries you could do what \neveryone else does: escalate into warfare and then get sick of it after a \ngeneration or two, then become friends. That's not an option. The lower \ndown one element of society is cast, the more animosity, which has nowhere \nto go.\n\nSo I hope you can see that I recognise your attempt to turn the whole thing \n180 and I hope you recognise I met you half way. I wouldn't have come back \nif I didn't enjoy good discourse and sharing.\n\n\nP.S. I'm not buying the Cultural Marxist crap that everything should be \nderided. Levity and satire are powerful social weapons, we can't afford to \nwave them around cutting down every tree that stands. I hope you recognise \nthat there in fact are things one shouldn't make light of on the personal \nlevel at least. Our culture isn't wholly defective and needing to be \nscrapped.",
