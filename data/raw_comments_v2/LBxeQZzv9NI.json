People are now able to \nget coverage.  Businesses who could not provide coverage now have employees \nwho can remain healthy and have coverage.   \n\nPresident Obama knew that he needed to get it passed and then make \nadjustments along with war to improve it.  I know people who are dropping \ntheir coverage and getting coverage on an exchange which is cheaper. I know \nmany of the independent contractors I hire who now have insurance when in \nthe past they never could afford it so this is a small business godsend. \n\nIts interesting that the many polls of business people I have looked at, \nbeing a business person, show that they are positive about the future of \nour country and see business growing.  Some have stated issues with \nObamacare but it seems more about misinformation that is being pushed in \nthese circles with many of them being Republican.  \n\nIt is truly an Affordable Care act to make insurance affordable to people. \n Funny how car insurance is mandatory and young people are the most risky \ncoverage so have the highest premiums.  Health insurance is almost the \nopposite with the young being less in need of coverage.  Now that many I \nknow can afford it because it is the many times lower than cable or cell \nphone they are confident that they do not have to fear the broken leg or \nillness.\ufeff",
