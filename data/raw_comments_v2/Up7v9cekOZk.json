He has a rail car subway system. The \nkid goes through mountains and made a theme park as well. He detonated \nenough TnT to create a crater and then discovered a remarkably deep trench. \nMost of the time, he's not even freaking playing it! He watches a video of \nsomeone playing it, says \"Hmm. I want to find Egypt\" then goes on for 10-15 \nminutes, finds Egypt AND IMPROVES EGYPT! He's seven!!! You know what I did \nwhen I was seven? Sharpening sticks and hucking them at my sister from a \nsturdy apple tree branch, that was in the yard of a house we rented from a \npastor. That's what I did when I was seven. I also filled a coffee can with \nactual worms, forgot about it until we were packing up the house because we \nwere moving, and then only remembered about the literal can of worms when \nmy parents discovered it, opened it, and then were forever repulsed by \ncompost, because that's where I got these gigantic earthworms from. The \nmassive compost heap in the yard of a neighbor down the street. It's \nmemories like these that make me happy that my sons are smarter than a \nseven year old girl who isn't afraid of worms and sharp objects... Also, I \nwouldn't be surprised if my oldest turned out to be an architect. You \nshould see the skyscrapers he builds, they're astonishing. The greatest \naccomplishment I had as a child was making an anatomically correct 2D \npegasus and then cutting off it's thing, because my teacher didn't approve, \ncalled up my parents, which led them into an argument of whether or not I \nshould keep a fictional paper animal intact. I had a strange childhood... \n\nLove your videos! Keep doing what you're doing and I hope to god you \nignored this. \ufeff",

Not making sense. Sorry.\nBut what bothers me is how he belittles it; I mean - he's an acclaimed \nwriter, has a majestic fan base and worldwide following and yeah, I suppose \nthat could make him critical about his work but, seriously, nothing could \nsurpass the only zombie book I own in crappiness. It's 117 pages (and yes \nsome see that as a novel) of tired apocalypse clich\u00e9s and stereotypes that \nI only bought because I wanted to try out the genre but I could just as \nwell have eaten a diaper.\n\nBut anyway my point is: John should be all \"Here's my new book world, make \nit hip, make it IT, make it scene or shrug it off your shoulders and don't \napprove a single word that I wrote.\"\nDFTBA\ufeff",
