Disadvantage is unsprung weight and bumps affecting both tyres - \nbut this actually happens with IRS as they are not truely independent.\nMain advantage of IRS is reduced unsprung weight, which should allow the \ntyres to follow road irregularities better. main disadvantages is the \nlinkage geometry can be a lot more difficult to work out and is more \ncomplex to fit in the vehicle.\nWith smooth road/track surfaces, the beam axle can do a very good job, \npotentially better than any IRS setup.\nAxle tramp can be caused by a variety of factors, from spring windup, too \ncompliant bushings, poor traction characteristics of the vehicle, etc. \nheck, as with a beam axle you need to control a lot more mass, it can ba \nargued that an IRS 'should' be better (I suspect the insulating bushings of \nthe diff carrier would be a significant factor). The higher tier drag cars \nuse no suspension whatsoever, with the axles being fixed to the chassis but \nthey have huge problems with wheel tramp/tyre shake.\nThere is an intermediate design, the De Dion, which uses a chassis mounted \ndifferential but the two wheels are connected together with a structure - \nthis isolated the suspension from the torque reaction (wedge) that a \nconventional beam axle would have, but allows the same basic geometry and \npackaging of the beam axle.\nThe latest Mustangs are built with IRS - must be a good reason for FORD to \nspend the additional cost of developing that and adding it to the sticker \nprice...\n\nRegardless, if it works, it works :-)",

The IRS would basically be doing nothing except putting more \nstress on one tire that doesn't really need it, rather than lettting the \nengine disperse it evenly throughout both wheels, and allowing the \nsuspension to worry about it's own problem.* I really hope this made sense, \nand didn't seem obnoxious (I did use caps, but for emphasis, and typed up \nhalf a book, my bad lmao.), because I completely agree that 90% of the \ntime, an IRS can't be beat, ESPECIALLY if your looking for ultimate grip. \nBut I've driven both types more times than I can remember, and \noccasionally, when the power and suspension are nicely balanced, a rear \nlive axle just FEELS GOOD. It feels like your have complete control over \nboth the front and the rear of the vehicle, which in the right hands, is \nWAAAY better than a vehicle that you can just floor and wait for your front \ntires to give and oversteer. Some people prefer to have the best all around \ngrip balance and the occasional oversteer, some people feel more \ncomfortable controlling the oversteer, and knowing THEY are in full solid \ncontrol of the rear of the vehicle (which, again, ONLY works if you have a \ngood suspension/weight balance), if a computer were driving both methods, \nthe live rear axle would have the torque/horsepower boost, and would come \nout of the corner with just a little extra torque, however for humans who \nmake mistakes, and for roads that suck at grip, IRS cannot be beat, it's \nmore forgiving and consistent.\nThis page explains it better LOL. \nhttp://www.f1technical.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=9491",

            "text": "+Brian Tracy Yes, but they never discussed its actual lateral grip, \ntherefor they did not refer to the title at any point in the video. And the \n911's rear weight bias is what gives it so much rear grip... Also Porsche \nis not in any way transitioning to the Cayman or Boxster, Porsche CEO has \neven come out and said that the Cayman and Boxster will not be allowed to \nsurpass the 911 because it is their Flagship car. Besides the Mustang also \nhas a weight bias, one at the front which causes under-steer. I would take \nan over-steer prone car over under-steer prone any day of the week. As long \nas you don't let off the throttle prematurely then the lift off over-steer \nof the 911is not an issue. The rear wheel steer of the GT3 as well as other \nchassis magic that Porsche has been performing on their rear engine wonder \nhas made it one of the best handling cars of all time, the Mustang on the \nother hand has no such accolades, it is simply fast in a straight line. \nThis Mustang is a special case however and it appears to be a riot to \ndrive, but again they did not provide any insight into the proposed \nquestion, \"More grip than a GT3?\".",
