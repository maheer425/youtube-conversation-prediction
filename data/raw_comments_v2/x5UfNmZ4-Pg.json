Pele scored 800 more goals then Messi and was by age 17 \nalready a world champion. With all Messi's glory he has never had the honor \nto be crowned world champion for Argentina. He and Cristiano Ronaldo are \nworld class club players but lack the completeness of being a champion for \ntheir national teams. If Messi was as great as Pele, Argentina would have \nas many world titles as Brazil right now. I don't think anyone has ever \nbeen better than Pele. Pele scored more than 1284 goals, 95 goals for \nBrazil's national team, 12 goals in the World Cup. Pele could bicycle kick, \nhead, dribble, fly in the air. Pele was a super athlete and perfect player. \nYou take Messi, Maradona and Di Stefano which are Argentina's top 3 and \nthey don't come even close to Pele. Since the 1970's Pele has remained the \nking of the sport in a undisputed matter. Pele who was named athlete of the \n20th century and Fifa player of the century holds various guinness world \nrecords as a player. He is the world's only 3 time world cup champion in \nhistory. Won more than 60 titles, 2 time Libertadores champion in South \nAmerica, 2 time world club champion with Santos FC. 11 Time top goal scorer \nin Sao Paulo State championships, and 10 time state champion, 5 time Brazil \nNational champion. No player in history has been able to beat Pele. Now \neven Brazil's top champions like Ronaldo, Romario, Mane Garrincha, Rivaldo, \nKaka, Ronaldinho also have good arguments in topping Messi. Messi is not \neven fully considered 1 absolute in Argentina where Diego Maradona is \nconsidered the best player in Argentina's history. ",
