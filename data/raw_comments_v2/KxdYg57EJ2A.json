It also shows how diverse \ntheir music can be and that's pretty fucking awesome too. The way this was \nmade was just so genius, it gives each persons vocals more impact, \nespecially the rapping like when J-Hope started rapping I got goosebumps \nand they didn't go away until Suga had finished. This entire remix is an \nactual work of art and I'm so glad they made this, not many groups (not \njust in South Korea, but worldwide) can turn such an aggressive original \ntrack into something like this, it flows beautifully. It also made me \nquestion my loyalty to my bias Taehyung because good lord Jimin looks so \ngood in this.
