            "text": "An apple has an inside and an outside, .....correct ? After all, how could \nit not have both an inside and an outside !\n\nThe universe also has an inside and an outside. After all, how could it not \nhave both an inside and an outside !\n\nHowever, in the world of physics, there is no attention being paid at all \nconcerning the outside, nor do they even ponder the idea of there possibly \nbeing an outside. Thus the outside is totally rejected by today's \nphysicists.\n\nAn inside is different than an outside, thus the laws of physics on the \noutside of the universe are different than the laws of physics on the \ninside. An event can be governed from either of these two sides.\n\nWhenever an event is governed from the outside, while being observed by \ntoday's physicists on the inside, thanks to their ongoing total ignorance \nof the outside and the laws of physics on the outside, they see nothing but \nan event that has no fully explicable cause. They place such an event under \nthe title \"The Mysteriousness of Quantum Mechanics\".\n\nToday's physicists subconsciously have decided to leave the \"outside\" to \nthose imaginative religious folk. In turn, the mysteries go on and on via \ntoday's physicists demanding the acceptance of pure mysteriousness rather \nthan finding the true cause or foundation. Thus there is an ongoing mere \n\"acceptance\" of Particle/Wave Duality, Action at a Distance, Entangled \nPairs, Collapse of the Quantum Wave, Delayed Quantum Choice, Quantum \nErasure, etc., yet there is absolutely no interest in the full explanation \nof each such bizarre phenomena.\n\nHowever, if you include the laws of physics on the outside, all of these \nmysteries disappear in an instant. But, unfortunately, concerning this \ncomplete inside/outside understanding, today's physicists currently have no \ninterest at all in such completeness. Thus any presentation given of the \noutside laws of physics, is a useless presentation. It is ignored by the \nphysics community in a nanosecond.\ufeff",

Just like how your crowd claims computers as \nproof of quantum physics and GPS as proof of relativity, the believers of \nGod may claim the same as proof of existence of God. It may be true that it \nis your religious crowd who have actually invented and produced those funny \ngadgets and hence may want to solely get the credit. But the believers of \nGod have a logical argument \u2013 it is actually God who created everything in \nthis world including your religious crowd. So whatever your religious crowd \ninvents and produces, the credit must go to the God in the first place. So \ncomputers and GPS actually prove the existence of God before they prove \nyour stupid religion.\n\nAncient humans were able to accurately predict the occurrence of solar and \nlunar eclipses despite their weird reasoning and understanding of why an \neclipse occurs. And ancient physicians had successfully treated many \ndiseases despite their poor understanding of the actual diseases and the \npathophysiology.\n\nFinally just because a farm worker manages to produce eggs from hens, and \ngrows paddy from the fields, it doesn\u2019t mean that he knows everything about \nthe creation. To do those things he only requires a superficial knowledge \nof them. And same is the case with the \u2018cultivators\u2019 of your religion \u2013 \nthey simply make use of some superficial knowledge to make your computers, \nGPS and other gadgets.
