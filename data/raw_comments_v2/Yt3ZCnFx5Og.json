This \ndeadly poison did worsen conditions in the sea, and the atmosphere \ncontained some H2S as well, but way less than the oceans. Between \nacidification, hypoxia and hydrogen sulfide the oceans fared way worse than \nland species.\n Perhaps we will be one of the 25% that could survive a repeat of the \nPermian-Triassic extinction.
