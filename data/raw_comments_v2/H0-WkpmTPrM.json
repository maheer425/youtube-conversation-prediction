A more \ndirect look at the video reveals contradicting claims. How can a supposedly \nliar speak in \"simple terms\" like \"I did not have sexual relations with \nthay woman\" while also speaking in \"convoluted\" terms? The producer is \nbasically making a claim that \"liars\" speak; he described the only two \ncomplexity at which a person can speak.\nI am not, however, rejecting the validity of linguistic text analysis for \nan analysis in speech in explicit context can reveal one's truthfulness. I \nam merely suggesting that viewers should not use the extremely generic \ncases explained in the video as a guideline in determining another's \ntruthfulness in very specific context.\ufeff",
