And 10^82 atoms in the universe. the Hubble constant is 3 \nH^2/8 pi G, which works out to be 1.0 x 10^-29 grams/cubic centimeter or \nabout 0.000005 atoms of hydrogen/cc. It is believed that only 4 percent of \nthe critical density is in the form of normal atoms, so this leaves \n0.000005 x 0.04 = 0.0000002 hydrogen atoms/cc. Multiplying this by the \nvolume of the visible universe, you get about 1.7 x 10^77 hydrogen atoms. \nAnyway, too many atoms and particles and numbers for one day. :P",
