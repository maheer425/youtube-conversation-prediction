And this fake liar Obama is a war criminal who \nbrought death and sorrow to Libya once the richest country on earth and now \nleft those immigrants drown in the oceans to the EU to deal with .... Obama \nwould killed Dr King by a drone strike as he would force Dr King to leave \nlike he did it with Aaron Swartz, Ed Snowden and many more.... That man \nObama is a war criminal brought death and suffering to Yemen killed 41 in \nal Majalah and then lied about it! Nelson the GREAT Mandel died and this \nwar criminal went to his funeral just because he could do it that that does \nnot justify itself its right! Cause it is not! Truth always prevails! And \ntruth hates Obama as much as Obama hates Truth and he is a lost soul sooner \nor later today or 59 years later no one will remember his promises but \neverybody will know his lies, killings, the suffering brought by him upon \nthe poorest.... his dark legacy is shared with the other cowards Bush Jr \nand his Poppy Bush and the Saudi Bandar Bush with the Clintons are all \nstink of guilty and they are nothing but liars. Obama is a shame of not \nonly the US but human race! Libya, Iraq, Ukraine, and in the shadow of the \ndeath of thousands in a failed state created by Obama Libya, Yemen, Iraq, \nSyria and now Ukraine. US is in turmoil lost all morals as Bush and his dad \nand Obama with the Clintons wanted to build a castle on pillars of sand and \nit collapses as a country and society collapses that built on lies. Obama? \nGave democracy to Libya he was very proud after he bombed destroyed the \nrichest African country and turn it into a land of savages. Peace prize? \nWar and Death prize. We lost Aaron Swartz and many others thanks to this \nman. Sorry for the people of US not just blacks, whites all americans as \nyou are lied, tricked and used and your fake leaders are giving a very bad \nreputation to you and destroying many lives around the world causing great \ndamage due to their violent war policies. It is coming to catch up with you \nas you are weak to get united and serve justice and peace. You are weak and \ndivided. I am sorry for you americans and also I am afraid of your insane \nleaders as they have their hands on dirty weapons that should not even \nexist. Obama? Bush? Poppy Bush? Bandar Bush? Clintons? They all have no \nguts to tell you the truth about 9/11 as the truth is so ugly and they \nafraid of the truth as the truth always prevails sooner or later but they \nwill be destroyed by their coward guilty silence and lies. No not one \npresident should be name after JFK as there was no president of the USA \nafter JFK. These guys are crooks coward liars. Jet Fuel isn't it? Its an \ninsult for me and the public to even assume that we are so dumb we believe \nall your stupid weak lies like Jet Fuel fire... you should have known \nbetter that state such a ridiculous nonsense. Facts and physics never lies. \nCIA highjacked all for sale dictatorship country where all is nothing but \nprofit is God. Matter over mind...see if that will work and for how long? I \nspeak 5 languages and watching these 5 nations Spain, Germany, England, \nRussia, Hungary. Its bad news for liars in the US as we are not stupid and \nwe know our history you cannot fool us. This game is not yet over but US \nalready lost it, long time ago. Money can't buy you love! And you don't \nneed the weathermen to tell you from which way the wind blows!\nIts a sad joy of knowledge and I am not happy to see what I see and will \nsee!\nGod Bless America, The Constitution and the Oath-keepers!\ufeff",

As such, it is the biggest threat to \npeace the world has ever known.\n\nFurthermore, to berate MLK's personal life is what we'd expect a petty, \nwhite racist, reactionist, anti-humanitarian, neo-con warmonger to do in an \nattempt to undermine one of the greatest civil rights leaders in world \nhistory. The critical perspective here is not whether or not he had \nmistresses or was a communist (which is not a bad thing), or whether people \ndeifying him is appropriate; those are all reasonable conclusions. It is \ninstead whether or not his analyses can be effectively applied today.  ",

That's a joke, right? \nLeaving aside the moral question of what exactly took place between \nsettlers in the new world and Native Americans back when (and it is far \nfrom a simple, one-sided picture), let me know when you can find a single \nreputable source anywhere that shows that 100 thousand Native Americans \nwere killed, let alone 100 million.

My point stands: \nAmericans have no right to criticize injustice if they can't even address \nthe extent to which their own country engages in it. \n\nWhy the reluctance to view America as one of the most violent nations ever? \nIs it because we're not as violent as I'm suggesting, or is it because \nyou're an American who can't stand looking in the mirror and seeing the \nvery thing you claim to abhor? I'd say it's the latter. For example, Hitler \nand Stalin killed, what, like, 50-60 million people together? America \nkilled 50-60 million Native Americans alone (and that's being nice; it is \nactually about 100million, considering diseases n shit). Hitler had a long \nway to go to get to America's violence, as did Stalin. Same goes for your \nother convenient deflections.",
