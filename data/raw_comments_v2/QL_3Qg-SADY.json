We \nare hear Now and we have to keep this place clean healthy and Rightfull as \nlong as we are going to stay here! Anyways my point about \"our nature\" etc. \nis that we all as humanity have to change deep inside us... we dont need \nwars we dont need bloodsheds and for sure we dont need nukebombs on our \nplanet..... we need to make the whole planet One society who acts rightfull \nand EVEN for ALL!!! This sounds like new world order but what they mean \nwhen they say that is totally diffirent and not rightful! I am against \ncapitalism! Capitalism is the notion of free market and much much \nantagonism and so the weak will fall mathematicly sure! As far as i know \nthe code of life itself on every being's DNA is made to make the stronger \nsurvive and thats good... but money is not a measure of toughness or \nsmartness or anything else... its just a measure when it comes to \"buying \nthings\" even if that thing is a notion itself like love or services or \nanything! So to end with this monologue we need laws that will have to do \nwith human rights.... if we want to call our selfs humans and differ from \nanimals we cant be proud when we drink beer while other people are \nbombed.... but we would be happy and proud if we knew that the whole planet \nis working as one and everyone who is wronged is getting the necessary \ntreatment on anycase...! ofcs there will be punishment, jails, psychiatric \nclinics etc... but at least we will have laws that will prevent the \nfollowing known statement from happening ===> \"If we dont have an enemy we \nmust invent one\". Humanity is going to pass through tons of bloodshed until \nit reaches that stage IF it reaches it ever! I am trying to be optimistic \nno matter the wars going on right now... after all i am not getting sad \nabout Mr's X death at midle east specificly! i am getting sad about \nhumanity as a whole when we dont act really deeply rightfully to regulate \nour own actions! Anyways My script is long but it is as close as i could \nexpress at the moment to my reallity! I come from Greece i am 27 years old \nand i would love to recieve your answears!",
