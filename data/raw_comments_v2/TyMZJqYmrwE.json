I've done different things for my daughter, and this \none only takes 25-30 minutes to do compared to an hour for some other \nthings. A $4 investment in a bunmaker is worth it!!  grab at a drugstore \ncheap, or even a supermarket. I grabbed mine at a makeup hair store with \nsome make up, used a coupon, and overall, the bunmaker was almost free.  \ngood luck! ",
