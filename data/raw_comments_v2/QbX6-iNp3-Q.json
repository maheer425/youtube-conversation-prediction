These conditions are what remove any \nrandomness or independent probability that would cause the remaining \nprobability to remain 50/50.

You pick 1 door and then \nif you want you can pick both other doors instead. At this point everyone \nwould agree that getting to open 2 doors has a 2/3 chance of winning.\n\nWell, this is actually exactly the same game.\n\nAll the host does in the original game is open 1 of your 2 doors for you.\n\nIn both games when you switch you end up with 2 doors open, neither of \nwhich is the door you started with.\n\nIn the end this all comes down to the very simple question, do you want to \nstick with the 1/3 group or move to the 2/3 group.",

THEN you would have a 50-50 \nchance of being right. But that's not what happens.\n\nSo, say you pick a door. Because there are three doors with an equal \nlikelihood of being right, you now have a 1/3 chance of having picked the \ncorrect door. Then the host intentionally opens a wrong door that you \ndidn't choose. Now here's the key: because the prizes haven't moved, you \nstill have only a 1/3 chance of having picked the correct door. The door \nthe host opened was never the correct door, which is why he opened it. The \ncorrect door hasn't changed at all. Therefore, the door you picked is \ncorrect if and only if it was correct before a door was opened; the \nprobability of that is 1/3. That leaves a 2/3 chance that the third door is \nthe correct one.\n\nIf you're still not convinced, think of it this way. Suppose that, instead \nof opening a door, the host told you that you could take either the prize \nbehind your door, or take both of the prizes behind the other two doors \n(minus any farm animals, of course). Obviously you would choose the latter \noption because that maximizes your odds of winning. But remember that only \none of the doors has a meaningful prize, which means that if it is indeed \nbehind one of the other two doors, the other one definitely has an animal \nbehind it. That means that if you do choose to take two prizes, there is a \n100% chance that at least one of them is an animal.\n\nBelieve it or not, this scenario and the actual Monty Hall Problem work on \nexactly the same principle. In the real game, by switching your choice, you \nare essentially choosing to take both of the prizes behind the other two \ndoors, minus the animal you have already seen. Because your action of \nchoosing a door left two doors behind, there is a 100% chance that one of \nthem has an animal behind it. The only difference is that the host is \ntaking that animal out of the equation by opening up one of those two \ndoors.

It's not the other door you didn't choose whose \nprobability doesn't change, it's the door you did choose. Think of it this \nway: suppose the winning prize is hidden behind door #1. There are three \npossible scenarios at the beginning: the contestant chooses door #1, door \n#2, or door #3. Each of these scenarios is equally likely, so they each \nhave a probability of 1/3. If the contestant chose door #1, the host will \nrandomly open either door #2 or door #3 because they are both wrong; these \ntwo events are equally likely and thus have a probability of 1/6 each (out \nof 1/3). If the contestant chose door #2, the host MUST open door \n#3 because it is wrong and door #1 is correct; the probability of this is \n1/3. If the contestant chose door #3, the host MUST open door #2 because it \nis wrong and door #1 is correct; the probability of this is 1/3. Now we \nhave four scenarios, two of which require that the contestant chose door #1 \nand each have a probability of 1/6, and the other two require that the \ncontestant didn't choose door #1 and each have a probability of 1/3. In \nevery scenario, door #1 is correct, so the probability that the contestant \nhas chosen the correct door is 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3. There's no \"Schrodinger's \ncat\" effect here; the fifty-fifty odds are just an illusion. It's trickery. \nThis is what makes this such a famous probability question, because the \nfact that you have only two doors left no matter what makes you THINK you \nhave fifty-fifty odds when in fact you don't.",

I just don't get it.  It seems pretty simple to me.\n\nyou make your choice when there are three doors; you have a 1/3 chance of \nchoosing the prize door and 2/3 chance of choosing a zonk when you make \nyour choice.  even after the host reveals and removes one zonk, it is still \nmore likely that the door you first chose is a zonk.  so you win more often \nif you always switch.  Why is that so hard to understand, I'm honestly \nasking?  When my economics class did the problem only a small part of the \nclass got it right, and when Car Talk used the question as their weekly \npuzzler, they got more letters from people telling them they were wrong \nthan with any other question they asked.  There just seems to be something \nabout THIS problem that scrambles peoples' minds.  \ufeff",
