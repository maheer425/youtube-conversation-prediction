CCTV is preparing for a \ndocumentary called The Internet Age. \nOur director appreciates your video \n\"Anglia_News_Broughton_Google_Street_View_complaints_&_Luton_Vauxhall_Workers_jobs\" \nvery much. We would much like that you could license us to use some \nvaluable footages of the vedio to perfect our documentary.\nHere's some information about the documentary:\u00b7 CCTV is the most \ninfluential media in China with more than 1 billion viewers. The Internet \nAge is an epic documentary with 10 episodes, each running about one hour. \nThis is by far the largest documentary project worldwide to focus on the \nhistory and the outlook of the Internet.\n\u00b7 The documentary will be aired at prime time on multiple channels; lasting \ntwo seasons, and expected to cover more than 200 million viewers (the \nBusiness and Financial channel will target the rising elite business class).\n\u00b7 The content will be made available for online viewing permanently on \nCCTV's official website, and it will also be released in English and Arabic \non CCTV's international channels. There will be followup programs and \nheated discussions on various most famous social media sites in China \nincluding Weibo, Wechat with lasting effect.\n\u00b7 CCTV has already interviewed many early Internet pioneers, entrepreneurs, \nindustry leaders, investors and academics including Vint Cerf, Tim \nBerners-Lee, Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Wozniak (co-founder of Apple Inc.), \nSteve Chen (Founder of YouTube), Mike Moritz (Sequoia Capitalist), Macon \nPhillips (the Director of New Media for the Presidential transition of \nBarack Obama) and many others. This is by far the most complete and \nup-to-date collection of interview footage about the Internet.\n\nMore information will be provided if necessary.\nThank you very much and we are looking forward for your reply\ufeff",

Riot's almost boasting that \ntheir game connected Tim and his friends together, but honestly that's just \nnot true. LoL is just a game that they play together for fun. Riot probably \ndoesn't care about this guy at all, their just using him as an excuse to \nshow off.
