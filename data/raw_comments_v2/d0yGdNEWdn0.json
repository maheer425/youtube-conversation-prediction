We are told we need to sit for the \ninternational exams, the Cambridge ones. The most popular one is the FCE \n(First Certificate Exam). We are told this is a MUST if you want to have a \nsuccessful career no matter your field of expertise. I sat for that test. I \ngot a 98 out of 100. And I learnt to speak english just like a baby does, \nby listening and repeating. My tool? Youtube. Simple as that. My friends \nwho pay attention in english classes didn't get higher than 70, some didn't \neven pass the test. The way languages are taught at school is \ncounter-intuitive and very stupid. You will never speak a language better \nthan you speak your native tongue. We must ask ourselves; how did we learn \nour native tongue? and THEN try to replicate that when attempting to learn \na new language.\ufeff",

This \nis just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nYou are listening to a TED TALK by a guy who said he focused on psychology, \nbut is lecturing to you on language learner.
