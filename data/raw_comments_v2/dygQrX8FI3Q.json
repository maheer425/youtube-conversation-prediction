Somehow I don't think that's the best example \nto be setting.\n\nOn the good side, it allows regular people to connect with him, to feel \nlike \"Hey he's cool, he's one of us.

Beer is among the most widely consumed \nbeverages on the planet, played a significant role in the history of \ncivilization, and provides many health benefits when consumed responsibly. \n Brewing is an art, and I applaud the President for recognizing the growing \ncraft beer culture in the US.  Alcohol abuse is an issue in our society \n(almost half of all violent crime is influenced by alcohol), but it's \nindividuals who make the decision to drink and do stupid things and \nultimately their responsibility.  Blaming alcohol lets criminals off easy \nby shifting the responsibility away from them\n\n\"If you will seek god for yourself you will see that your pastor has to be \nshepherd and not hireling\" - Does that mean the people in your church are \nsheep?\n\n    ",
