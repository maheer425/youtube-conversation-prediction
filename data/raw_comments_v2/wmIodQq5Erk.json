If certain criteria are met, the organization \nconducting the research must disclose financial statements that you have \naccess to and can see for yourself. If the organization is profit driven \nand funds its own research, then there is a good chance that you cannot see \nhow the money is spent, just like they cant see how you spend your money. \n\nYou want to see how the Red Cross is spending their money from donations? \nThat information is available to you. \n\nYou want to see how a privately funded organization spends is $$$? That's \nnone of your business. \n\nIf you donate to a cause, you should always do research on that \norganization and find out if it is worth giving them your money. The \ninformation is nearly always available, but no one is going to spoon feed \nit to you, you have to go search for it yourself. \n\nAnswer to 4: Cures are hard and cost a lot of money. That said, there is a \nlot of duplication of resources in the current health care system and money \nisn't always spent as well as it could be.\n\nThe problem is that health care doesn't lend itself well to \nprivate-for-profit organizations.
