At least not in the GM format.\nThe original (PC, DOS) version had its music in the MIDI format, which \nrequired a General MIDI capable sound card/chip.\nStoring all the music in wav or some other sound format on the cartridge \nwasn't an option. Music in that format would just take up way too much \nstorage space, which at the time was expensive.\nConverting the MIDI music to fit the sound chip in the Jaguar might have \nproven difficult. Most likely it sounded completely different, and not the \nway the makers of DooM intended it to be. So the last viable option was: \nSilence!\ufeff",
