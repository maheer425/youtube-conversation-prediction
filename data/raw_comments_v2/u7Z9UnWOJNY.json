Since dividing by zero is undefined and equal \nto infinity, this would help explain why the process is technically \ninfinite. Dividing non zero integers and getting zero is impossible. The \nproblem is not with maths, it is with division itself. The process of using \ndivision to arrive at an answer of zero would be infinite, because it is \nfutile to do so without first introducing zero into the equation.

In this case our \"computation\" will be \ndetecting whether or not the hands have \"collided\". So, as the distance \nremaining between the hands halves, the time taken for each move halves. \nHowever, we (or some finite physical thing) needs to *process* each step \nthe hands have taken in order to observe the clapping in some way. Sure, we \ncan subdivide the time to smaller and smaller increments, but we can't keep \nsubdividing forever - the inspection of the state takes *some time* so \ntherefore we can't keep going down the rabbit hole forever. For the human \nperception of motion this time limit is hit, far, far before Planck-y stuff \ncomes into play i would imagine.\n\nBut lets say we are speaking from the perspective of the atoms in the hand, \nand their position / momentum is effected by the meeting of the hands. \nWell, then we run into Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and Planck \nlengths/time - and we still preserve the statement that we cant do some \ninfinite amount of computation in a finite amount of time, and thus there \nis still some moment in time (With respect to our samples of the atom) \nwhere the state flips from \"not clapped\" to \"clapped\".\ufeff",

My layman's understanding is failing me at \nthe moment, but I remember that part of the defense of the \"Our universe is \na computer simulation\" theory is that there is a finite resolution to the \nuniverse.  (I really wish I could remember how that point was supported.)  \nIf this is accepted as fact, then movement through space cannot be an \ninfinite process.  The hand clapping must move a finite (but very large) \nnumber of...pixels, for lack of a better term, through 3D space.  At some, \nfinal point, you will indeed have a collision, since you eventually run out \nof pixels of space to pass through.\n\nAlternately, there is the fact that if you really were touching your hands \ntogether, you would probably be very aware of it.  While it may feel like \nthey are indeed touching, and a sound is indeed produced, this is a complex \nseries of events that happens when the particles making up one hand become \nsufficiently close to the particles in the other hand.  This same process \neffects a hammer on nail, a ball impacting the floor upon being dropped, \netc.  If you were to clap and actually allow the neucleai of these atoms \ncollide, there would probably be some amount of fusion involved.  \nparticularly with energetic applause.   I've never heard of a crowd nuking \nitself with applause, though.\ufeff",

If there is infinity contained within the space between 1 and 2, \ndoesn't that mean infinity can, in fact, have a beginning and an end? But \nwith clapping, you're simply covering an infinite number of points in \nbetween at an infinitely short amount of time per point. It's not about \n\"the process shouldn't end because it's infinite\". It's about the \nrelationship between how many steps (halves) the process has and how long \nit takes to complete them. They obviously can be completed, and there is an \nend to the infinite process.\nKind of imagining it like holding two ends of a lump of dough. At first it \nhangs straight and has an obvious beginning and end. But it starts to sag \nin the middle. It stretches and droops lower and lower. What was a short \nlump of dough is now a long length of dough. Let's say this goes on \nforever. The dough stretches and sags infinitely. There's still two end \npoints. But infinity is still contained within my length of dough. That's \nwhat's going on with the clapping situation. By halving it, you're just \nstretching the dough. \ufeff",
