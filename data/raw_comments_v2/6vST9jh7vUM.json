When the mixture is homogeneous, you do like the video. \nCooking is done on high heat at the beginning and at the end medium heat.\n\nYou can cover if you want your omelette well-cooked.\ufeff",

The \nonly difference here is that he whips it so that there's a lot of air \ninside, which makes it appear bigger.

The cooking \nprocess is similar to how you would go about making a sunny side up egg -- \nyou'll know it's cooked if you follow this because the heat will definitely \ncook the egg right through, as eggs usually take around five minutes to \ncook anyway :)",
