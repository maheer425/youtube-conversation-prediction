If actions that are performed strictly within ones \nawareness have a measurable effect on material structures it appears that \nthe materialistic/epiphenomenon model is outdated and that the Buddha's \nstatement that \"All mental phenomena have mind as their forerunner; they \nhave mind as their chief; they are mind-made.\" may have merit.I find these \nstudies on how mindfulness rewires and strengthens the brain very \ninteresting to say the least. I've practiced Satipatthana for a number of \nyears and many people are astonished at how well and clearly I remember, \nhow calmly I handle heavy loads of stress, and solve problematic situations \npeacefully; so I know first hand from years of experiences the powerful \nbenefits that arise from regular practice.

It is laborious and filled \nwith uncertainties. But it is certainly more qualified that sitting back \nwith a pint offering your best top of the barrel shot. The knowledge \ngleaned from such a process can be utilized in many ways. Sometimes to \nimprove the ability to resonate or create things that makes people resonate \nin certain ways.\n\nThe only difference between you and I is that I believe that in the act of \nunderstanding life it is useful with a bit of consistency and transparency, \nand also I do not hold a view that would not distinguish between the \nmedical opinion of a medical doctor and that of the hobo down at the corner \nbecause they just resonate to injury in different ways which are equally \ngood for health care because its all subjective.\n\nUnderstanding life, in a qualified way is not emotional in the same way as \nliving life and resonating to things you like, which is important too, if \nnot more, and holds it's own wisdoms.",

I have no problem with science but how some \npeople in science worship educated guesses that have evidence that support \nthe scientific claim.

For example, there is a plethora of scientific  \nevidence for and against man made climate change.  Why do we only hear in \na positive context, the man made climate narrative.  Politics and money I \nguarantee muddy up the water of that discussion.  I also see the \nsame faults in spiritual and/or religious matters.

Just as I am sure \nyou can name many things that are spiritual that can be explained through \nbiological processes of the human body and shifts in brain chemistry during \n\"mystic\" experiences, I can also show how many scientific tenets are merely \neducated guesses and that many scientific people want you to believe \nthem, without conducting the experiment themselves.

You are making a claim - \nso if you want that to be taken as more than just random speculation you \nshould be able to support it. Burden of proof rests with you.\n\nI would be under no obligation to disprove your claim and nor would science.\n\nYou then go on to speak of spiritual things. \"Spiritual\" is a concept not \nrooted in anything concrete. You have not defined it, and you have not \nshown it to exist. It is a word that you apply to point to a subjective \nexperence the roots and mechanics of which it does not explain. So saying \nthat science can't prove spirituality is both a statement empty of actual \ncontent and at the same time another truth claim you would have to cash in: \nThat granted a spirituality existed, what ever it is, science could not \ndescribe it. How could you possibly demonstrate that?\n\nTHe issue is this: the moment you could describe it yourself and show that \ndescription to have any correspondance with the known universe by pointing \nto demonstrable forces and mechanics - it would become science by \ndefinition.\n\nAll you are really saying as it is is that there are phenomena science \nhasn't touched yet, and you would like your idea of these gaps to be true, \nbut you can't show it. You would also like to create some gaps of your own \nand ask other people to disprove them.\n\nThis is where science is more honest than mysticism. It does not claim to \nknow what it can't support. You are doing this, and knocking science in the \nprocess. That's the issue.  \n\nFInally - I do not doubt you had a significant experience. I have a number \nof peak experiences myself, that I am deeply convinced mayn would have \ncalled spiritual. It is part of my work to try to optimize this.\n\nSome of these I am sure some people would interpret to be spiritual or \nsupernatural due to their power, depth and intensity and otherness. I never \nsaw any reason to call it anything or presume that it would be evidence of \nalternative realities just because it was real, rare and intensely sublime. \nWhy would it be?\n\nFInally a lot of aspects of what is often termed spiritual in meditation \nactually can be quite well explained by science, from the everyday notions \nof trance or flow that tends to follow ritual repetition or prayer and even \nsome higher-order experiences produced by stimulating certain glands. It's \nall neurochemicals and manipulating the mechanics of the body.\n\nAnd a final thing: If you wanted to make the claim that this is simply the \nspiritual acting on the physical in a sort of co-dependent way, that is \nfine. But you would still have to define what spiritual is, and show how \nsomething non-material or non-physical can act on the material body. If a \nforce exists that has causal power, then the effects of such a power would \nbe measurable even if the force was not directly so.\n\nNone of the meditative philosophies offer explanations of MECHANICS of \nthese things. They offer a practice with a story on top. As any scholarly \nperson will know it is quite possible to make fairly consistent \nphilosophical systems that in no way maps onto reality.\n\nAll science is saying that for us to really have an EXPLANATION we need to \nunderstand the specific mechanics and forces of process. THat's not \narrogant. That's very humble.\n\nArrogance is making complicated truth claims, about experience, with no \nevidence at all. And since there is a myriad possible ideas one could have \nabout subjective experience, yours would be relevant as an actual \nexplanation the moment it gained acttual scientific weight. Until then \nthere is nothing alternative about it. It's just a story. It could be true, \nbut you'd have to show the connection between what you experience and what \nyou say.\n\nIf you can't be bothered and just wanna live your life that's fine too. But \nyou chose to speak up, and unless you are just preaching or imposing \nyourself on the world - thats an invitation to dialogue. ",
