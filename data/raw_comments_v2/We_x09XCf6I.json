A true 100% wax or sealant should then protect your new \nshine from the elements there after.  So you fix the paint by polishing and \nthen you should only maintain your paint by a good ph balanced shampoo and \nwax/sealants.  If you notice a huge difference in shine the sealant or wax \nmay have things like silicone in them or fillers and these should be \navoided for long term paint protection.. I restore vintage cars and I know \nwhat some of these silicones and additives do to the paint. Wax is not \nideal does not last long, but is still the best and any long term sealant \nyou read about does NOT last as long as published and you are required to \n\"treat\" the protectant as often as waxing? so why bother?\ufeff",
