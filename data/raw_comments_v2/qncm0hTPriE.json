If this is the \ncase, then time travel can only occur from the invention of the first time \nmachine (receptor) and forward. With that, time travel forwards and \nbackwards could be possible, but you could just never travel further back \nthan the invention of the first receptor.\n\nIf I remember correctly, this is how time travel worked in the Austin \nPowers movies (at least Dr. Evil\u2019s time machine): You traveled from one \ntime gate to another (or the same gate in another time).",
