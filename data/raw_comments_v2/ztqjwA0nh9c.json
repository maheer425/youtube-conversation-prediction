If you sever a leg and keep it alive somehow, it \nwill grab objects and try to put them in a nonexistent mouth, because each \nleg has enough neurons to plan out complex movements like that. They also \nhave amazing colorchanging skin, which unlike chameleons is controlled by \nneurons that can react instantly.
