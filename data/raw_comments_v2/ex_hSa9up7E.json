The little sisters help Jack escape to building. \nFontaine got trapped in the building. Jack, Tennabuam,\nand the little sister watched the building fall down. Fontaine/Atlas\ndies premently. Tennabuam thanks Jack for the help if your rescue all \nlittle sisters. Tennabuam is angry with you if your harvest all little \nsisters. Tennabuam and the little sisters leave Rapture without Jack. \nTennabuam said he can control rapture now. Jack heads to Ryan's office to \ncontrol Rapture. But he thinks about what he could do. He has a choose to \nleave Rapture, or he could control Rapture. If you leave Rapture even if \nyou harvest little sisters or not Tennabuam will be happy with you no \nmatter what. If you stay in Rapture, and if you save little sisters \nTennabuam will still think you are a hero. If you harvest, and stay in \nRapture, Tennabuam will be angry with you. If you save little sisters, the \nlast thing you will see is a little sister smiling with even if you stay in \nRapture. If you harvest, a little sister will be frowning even if you go \nwith Tennabuam.\n\nBioshock 2:\n\nSubject Delta gets out of the life boat with Eleanor. Even if you kill the \nNPCs Lamb will live. Lamb gets out of the life boat. Delta glares at her. \nShe apologizes to him. Delta has a choice to kill her, or spare her. If you \nkill her, Delta will drill her, and Eleanor goes back to land, and leaves \nDelta there cuz she thinks he is a monster. If you spare Lamb, Delta, \nEleanor, and Lamb will leave and head to land to live. If you harvest \nlittle sisters you will see a little sister sitting against a wall with \nblood of a spliced that you killed. If you save all little sisters, a \nlittle sister will be on the floor playing with her teddy bear, and blocks \nwith a picture of Delta.\n\nBioshock Infinite: \n\nBefore Elizabeth drowns Booker, she stops and thinks for a moment. She \nrealizes if she goes back the underwater city (Rapture) she will find \nanother Comstock that she needs to kill. Booker tells Elizabeth that the \ncity is called Rapture. Booker told her to open a tear for Booker back to \nNew York. Elizabeth opens a tear Rapture. They both enter their own tears. \nAnd high pitch note of the harp ends the whole game.\n\nI know these sound like good endings. Bioshock Infinite only has one ending.\n\ufeff",
