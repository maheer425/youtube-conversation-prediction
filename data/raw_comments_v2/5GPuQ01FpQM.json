He thinks that bears would be happier in the \nwilderness where they would suffer from the harsh weather conditions and \nhave to hunt and kill other animals in order to survive. Yes, living in a \nforest surrounded by wild aggressive animals and having to endure hunger \nfor days is less stressful than having to do a couple of easy tricks for a \nliving, right? The fact of the matter is that bears are HAPPIER among \nhumans than among wild wolves and boars. Dancing bears are part of the \nRussian folklore. And a beautiful part I might add. NO ONE has the right to \ntell us what to do with our bears. There are no signs of violence on the \nbear in this video.

When they \nwere scheduled to ship out to France, Harry arranged to have Winnipeg stay \nat the London Zoo, where she ended up staying.  Throughout her life, she \nwas adored and treated with nothing but kindness by Lt. Harry, his fellow \nsoldiers, and everyone at the zoo.  Winnie was so friendly and playful that \nthe son of A.A. Milne changed the name of his stuffed bear from 'Edward \nBear' to \"Winnie the Pooh.\"  Winnie was not a slave, she was a beloved \ninternational celebrity and has a series of books and endless media \ndedicated to her even now, 100 years after she was born.",
