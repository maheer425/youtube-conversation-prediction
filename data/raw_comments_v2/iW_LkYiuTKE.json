Look at the graph of \nx^3-3x^2+3 to see what I mean, and you'll see why it's so sloppy.\nIf you change the \"+3\" to \"+4\", then you'll see that the function still has \nthree roots, but the MVT wouldn't provide any information because the \nrightmost root is also a local minimum, so there would be no negative f(d) \nvalue.
