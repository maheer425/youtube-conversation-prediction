They don't even know I'm signed up, but I have made \njokes and hints about it with my partner.

I desperately want to see if \nwe get to travel to the stars, if we find out there is other life in the \nuniverse (even if it's only pond scum... though if there is intelligent \nlife elsewhere in the universe one of those planets has to have the first \nlife on it that can travel outside its solar system. We could be the \nfirst!). As far as missing people I'm pretty much a loner and a weirdo \nanyway so I think I could get by in a society that it is totally foreign to \nme.\n\nI just hope that in the future we can \"euthanize\" cryonics patients rather \nthan wait for them to legally die - so I start feeling tightness in my \nchest and a tingly left arm they take me in for \"surgery\" and give me the \nanaesthesia and all of a sudden I wake up in a different hospital and it's \nthe year 2315.\n\nThen again we may not have to worry about this problem. I'm only 34 and \nhave no vices - don't drink, smoke, or use drugs and have longevity in my \nfamily so barring something crappy happening (accident or young age cancer) \nwe may well see the anti aging nut cracked within the next 50-60 years \nanyway. I've thought for the past 10 years when I see interstellar travel \nmentioned I always thought that indefinite lifespan would be cracked far \nsooner than getting to the nearest stars in less than a century would be \nachieved.
