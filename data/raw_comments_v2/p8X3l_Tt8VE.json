Racism as a word, and this \nis what so many people don't get, doesn't mean showing racial stereotypes. \nStereotypes like tropes and other cultural phenomena, like Nerds wearing \nglasses or Jocks alway playing football is done to show someone fast and \neasy to udnerstand, who a character is without having to tell the audience. \nNorally it is more often used in kids shows, Pumbaa in the Lion King is fat \nand clumsy and a pig, the Witch in a Movie is ugly so kids can see who is \nweird and perhaps not with well intentions.\n\nRacism or sexism or whatever-ism means that not only are people different \nand showing that exaggerated. It means that these people are \"inferior\" or \nhave a \"lesser quality\". Racism thinks that some Races are better than \nothers. Islamism thinks that Moslems are better than other people. Sexism \nthinks that Men are more intelligent... or women are more intelligent. \nRacism means, that people of other races are not entitled to the same \nrights and priviliges that the \"own\" race has.\n\nShowing differences is not racism. Denying differences is stupid cause \neveryone is different. We are all different and showing that is no problem. \nBut we should have the same rights and priviliges. Nobody is better or \nworth more because of race or gender or intellect or anything. That's the \npoint of not being racist. And not to hide differences or not showing them.\ufeff",

The blackfacing is one of the best \nexamples of this problem.\nThere are nations where blackfacing was used in their history to make \nracist jokes against black people (I have in mind in special U.S. and for \nsome extant for example the Netherlands).\n\nOther nations instead never used this to make fun of black people. \nTraditionally these nations never importat many slaves into their boarders \nso that there were never many descendents of these slaves to make fun of. I \nam living in Germany and as far as I know, the first black people living \nhere were the children of U.S. soldiers made in the after the second world \nwar.\nI heard about the racist conotation of blackfacing the first time when I \nheard about autrages in the U.S. because of this action. The only situation \nwhen a person blackens their face I knew about here in germany is an old \ntradition on Epiphany when three children walk from door to door, blessing \nthe houses while they are dressed as the three kings. Since one of the \nthree kings was black, they honor him by putting ash or other black paint \ninto the face of this boy.\n\nYou see the diference: U.S. blackfacing to ridicule, Germany (for example) \n= blackfacing to remember that one of the three kings were black. It is \nnormal that the act of painting a face black is seen completly different in \nthese culturs and that it can happen that you walk during carnival into \nsomeone with a blackened face, making party in the streets. It is not seen \nas a bad thing to do.\n\nTo get back to the video: You can't say something is rasist by the \nstandarts of your society when you judge some product of another society \nwithout considering their cultur and their traditions. Maybe, something \nthat offend you is ment as an honor by the other person.\ufeff",

I grew up in Korea \nand was well immersed in its culture, and black facing was... a common way \nto play the role of a \"tribal\" like character, most likely in a comedy or \nsome type of play, usually depicting the character as uneducated, \nuncivilized human. But not trying to purposely degrade tribal people, but \njust in a way of playing a \"uncivilized\" character. Of course, it can be \nvery (well it probably is very) offensive, but people of Korea wasn't \naware, at that time, of the consequences of being racist and how ignorant \nthey can be seen if they did such things in the eyes of the international \ncommunity. Back in the early 80's and late 90's they probably threw on a \nblack face to make caveman sounds to make people laugh, thinking it's \nfunny. Nowadays though, you don't see any black face in any Korean media, \nbecause they learned that what they did was... Terribly racist. It's easy \nto be quite racist when you're born and raised in a country where you don't \nsee a lot of different looking foreigners about, and the only really \ndifferent looking foreigners you see is through the eyes of TV. But Korea \nis visited by many different foreigners these days, and being more exposed \nto other international cultures and gaining perspective. \n\nTo put it shortly, it was a mistake, without ill-intent and better \nunderstanding of how the international community would react to a such \ncharacter. People can fight for Jynx and Mr Popo's right to stay pitch \nblack, but I think it was a better move to change their color to avoid \nupsetting some people... Unless... I don't know, their original color is \nabsolutely vital to the plot or the game or something. Racism is such a \nsensitive issue, I think it's better to just side step.\n\nIf Nintendo (or the creator of Jynx) knew the exact details of issues \ncaused by racism (and the issues that caused racism) in United States, they \nwould think twice about creating a pokemon that can possibly upset and \noffend many people like that.\ufeff",

But, in countries where they don't have \nsuch history, black face does not have any racial connotation. In fact, if \nyou actually think that US perspective of racism is the only right \nperspective, you are being ethnocentric as you refuse to even consider  \nperspectives from other countries and cultures. Ethnocentrism is as bad as \nracism.\n\nWe should also consider the intentions of those people. If people said \nracial slurs, we really need the contexts. Did they say those slurs as they \nwere really hateful? Or did they say those slurs because they were talking \nabout racism and racial slurs? If it's the latter, then you cannot say they \nare racists, not even the slightest. Racists love to dehumanise other \npeople. But, labeling certain people racists when you don't even bother to \nfind out their intentions means you dehumanise them.\ufeff",
