But I \nwill share what I have been told from Astronomy class.\n\nBlack holes are primarily formed from high mass stars when they die - they \nrun out of fuel. This causes fusion to stop, and since fusion is the force \nfighting against and balancing out gravity in stars, gravity is allowed to \nrun rampant. Gravity will crush the star in on itself, and granted that it \nis a star of high enough mass, it will be crushed down to an infinitely \nsmall point. THIS DOES NOT MEAN INFINITE MASS. It means infinite density.\nThe black hole will have something called an event horizon, within which \nlight (and therefor nothing else) can resist getting sucked into the \nsingularity, due to gravity. Please note: this event horizon is very tiny. \nIf you were to force our sun down to the size of a singularity and create a \nblack hole (and technically any object with mass could create a \nproportionate black hole if somehow crushed down enough), the orbits of the \nplanets would be unchanged. this is because the MASS stays the same (and \ntherefor the gravity effect a bit out from the even horizon), disregarding \nwhatever is absorbed after the fact. \nBottom line: The literal definition of a singularity is a point of infinite \ndensity. It's perfectly possible, and the math works out. To be able to \nunderstand things on a galactic/cosmic level you have to kinda ditch your \nclosed minds.\ufeff",
