If the rain clouds are not moving very fast and \nthere is a vast amount of clouds incoming from any direction, it'd be best \nto move or run to a new destination. (Preferably a shelter from the rain) \nThough the wetness per meter may not change between running or standing, \nthere is a certain point where you are completely soaked and the excess \nwetness does not really soak into your clothes or hair anymore and then the \nwetness is not an issue.
