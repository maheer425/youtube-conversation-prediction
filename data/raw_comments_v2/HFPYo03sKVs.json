However, while my mom is Irish, Hungarian, and \nGerman, her side is all blonde and light brown. If she does carry the gene, \nit's gotta be extremely far back, because it hasn't shown up for several \ngenerations. On the other hand, the pain reception is extremely true. I \nhave an extreme phobia of needles (which sucks being that I have \npre-melanoma freckles removed from my skin about every 2-3 years), and \npeople just don't understand that for me it's not \"just a pinch.\" I also \nhate being tapped or hit lightly, because while it doesn't bother most \npeople it's extremely irritating to me, even painful sometimes.\ufeff",
