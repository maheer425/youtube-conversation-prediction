Currently, the max per annum tuition fee is \u00a39k($13.5k). The \npoorest students can apply for fee waivers or grants from their university. \n[A quick note, the highest fee was \u00a33k/yr ($4.4k/yr) prior to 2010, the \nDeputy Prime Minister, who signed a pledge not to increase the fee, has \nconstituency with a high student population - the UK elections are in a few \nweeks].\n\nAs the UK has a system of devolution, each of the 4 nations can decide how \nmuch of the tuition students in their country pay. Scotland has chosen to \nmake tuition free for all Scottish students, England chose the maximum and \nWales/Northern Ireland are somewhere in the middle.\n\nHowever, all loans are administered the same way. All fees are paid to \ninstitutions on a student's behalf, you don't have to take out personal \nloans. As an EU citizen, the same applies if I want to travel abroad to a \nEuropean university for a term(semester). You can get funding through the \nEramus Programme.\n\nThe interest rate is 3-5% and the debt does not affect your credit rating \nscore. The new system means you'll only pay back loans on your income above \n\u00a321k($31). If you fall below this, your repayments stop. After 30 or so \nyears, the slate is wiped clean.\ufeff",

The reasons for this are \ncomplicated (human action is complicated) but to sum it up, the state makes \neverything expensive (taxes & regulations & inflation & welfare & war & \ncorporate favors et al) which in turn makes it hard for existing businesses \nto make a profit (they lay-off or worse, close down) and makes it hard for \nnew businesses to start (higher barrier to entry.)  Even just recently, \nmajor internet companies like Comcast are now benefiting from the so-called \n\"net neutrality\" (just bumping up the internet into \"public utility\" \nclassification) in that the cost of developing a new internet company has \nshot way up, meaning less competition for existing corporations, meaning \ngreater profit margins for them but overall Americans are worse off since \ntheir already shitty internet at outrageous prices are going to get \nshittier and yet more expensive; why should they improve?  What are you \ngoing to do, go to another company?  There is no other company!\n\nFrom what I can tell, most Americans wanted this to happen, because, \ny'know, the market is evil and all that.  So unless Americans pull up their \npants and strap on their big boy belts and start accepting that life \ninvolves risk, that no government can ever protect them from that, which I \ndoubt will happen soon enough to turn this sinking ship around, then you \nshouldn't be worried about paying off your debts, because you likely never \nwill; at this point you're lucky to make ends meet on your own.  This is \nnot even considering the national debt which has exceeded the point of no \nreturn, but I guess we're not going to talk about that.  What happens when \nthe U.S. government can't pay its bills (esp. consider its military bill) \nbecause no nation wants to lend us money anymore and there are too few \nbusinesses left to pick up the tax burden?\n\nThat's right kiddies, no more USA, at least not as we know it.  But fuck \nit, good riddance; no American likes how things are now anyway, ironically \ndespite being the #1 cause of its woes (no, it's not the politicians, it's \nnot the feds, it's not the banks, it's not the corporations, it's \nAmericans, who give these people power over them); corruption is rampant, \nwe're all broke (you're lucky to be just broke, a ton of you guys are even \nworse off than that), constantly depressed, tired from working too much, \nunsatisfied with just about everything.

My med school books are all over 4,500 MXN, about \nmaybe 300 USD, and 2 books of mine are 12,000 MXN, like 800 USD. Are \ncolleges in the US all private or have to pay a hefty fee? In my school I \nonly pay literally 50 cents of a Mexican peso (0.3 cents in USD). For a \nfull year. UNAM. and my university UNAM is the best in Mexico and in the \ntop 5 of latin america, definteley not comparing Mexicos Universities with \nUnited States, the top Universites of the World are in the US but, why is \ncollege so expensive in the US? I have a friend thats from Panama and he is \nrenting an apartment for 16,000 MXN (about 1,200 USD) a month. And food is \nrelativity cheap in Mexico.\n\nAnd transportation, I spend 10 pesos every day to get on the Metro. Less \nthan a dollar.\ufeff",

            "text": "Two points: (1) Dispite its expense, advanced education is still vitally \nimportant for individual job seekers as well as society as a whole.  \nHowever, we need to rethink how we approach education.  As someone with \nmultiple degrees and a mountain of student debt, my best recommendation to \nall prospective students who do not have access to affordable education is \nto ignore everyone who says you need to take out loans and get your degree \nin 4 years or less.  Make staying debt free an equal priority to getting \nyour education.  This of course, will require that you work at least part \ntime while going to school part time, find cheaper substitutes for books \nand learning materials, live at home or in cheap/shared housing, ride a \nbike when possible, eat cheap, attend schools with the lowest cost per \ncredit hour, etc.  This is also your best way of boycotting the for-profit \neducation/lending insustry in the US.  In order to get cheaper loans and \nmore student friendly student loan laws, we must make the industry compete \nfor our business.  The only way to do that is take your business away from \nthem.  Otherwise, the industry will continue to abuse its captive consumers.\n(2)  While it is true that student loans are generally non-dischargeable in \nbankruptcy, there is one hardship exception that students with special \neconomic circumstances such as large medical bills, serious health \nproblems or other serious obstacle to repayment should talk to a qualified \nbankruptcy attorney about.  However, this exception is rather difficult to \nmeet.  Bankruptcy rules, including the hardship exception mentioned above, \nbecame much harder on students since 2005 due to lobbying efforts by the \nlending industry which successfully achieved far more creditor friendly \nrules.  These are the same lenders that caused the Great Recession that is \nstill making it difficult for new graduates to find jobs to pay off those \nexcessively large and high interest student loans.  Schools and lenders \nshould be held at least partly responsible for selling students on a highly \nexpensive and largely financed education that fails to deliver good paying \njobs.\ufeff",
