When I first came to China 3.5 years ago, my Mandarin was \ndreadful, but I still got a slew of compliments on a daily basis. These \ndays, with my fluent Mandarin, I feel like the reactions I get from cab \ndrivers, waitresses etc...are pretty much the same. This has made me truly \nrealize how generous their evaluation of my Mandarin was 3 years ago...",

Its good that you want to learn so many languages, but Japanese \nand Russian took me 2 years to a good conversational level. Some months ago \nI satrted Moroccan Arabic (not the standard one) and also that is a pretty \ncomplicated language. Since this is the beginning of your journey, pick ONE \nlanguage and later one, when you have more experience you can learn 2 at \nthe same time. Because you have to think about it: A language journey will \nnever end. You will never \"complete\" Japanese, you will learn more and more \nlanguages at the same time.
