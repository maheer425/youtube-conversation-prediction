If time slows down the faster we move relative \nto the speed of light, and the speed of light is a constant.  How fast are \nwe actually moving right meow, I mean right meow, right meow, like RIGHT \nNOW TRACE!!!  How fast are we moving???\n\nWe are on this Rock we call Earth rotating on this axis at 0.29 miles per \nsecond at the equator (Google, 2015).  The Earth is revolving around our \nGreat Sun at some 18.64 miles per second (Google, 2015).  Our Solar System \nis revolving around our magnificent Milky Way Galaxy at a some 125 miles \nper second (Google, 2015).  And our Milky Way is moving at an \"unknown\" \nincreasing speed from wherever we were, to wherever we are going (Big Rip, \nBig Freeze, Big Bounce, Big Bang, etc...).  Because I am not perfectly \nstill, assuming that I am moving at some percentage of the speed of light, \nI'm 31 years old now, how old would I be if I was not moving at all in this \nuniverse???  What is my True age?\n\nThanks Trace, and DNews for all the knowledge you have embarked on me.\n\nI'm going to go to the Gym now, I've procrastinated enough.\n\nSee you Later,\n\nMurat\ufeff",

If you get what I mean.\n\nI've always seen time as the passing of events, and I've used this to help \npeople with depression and such as I try to motivate them to fill their \nlives with activities so that time can pass on quicker for them, and they \ncan draw further away from those past times that hold them down.\nThe reason why I feel that works, is that if you have something bad happen, \nand after that you don't do anything new with yourself, then essentially \nyour mind is in the same time zone as when that bad situation happened as \nthere's no new information to fill it, and you're reliving the most recent, \nnotable event that has occurred in your life.\nSo my understanding of time is purely theoretical. Purely a measurement we \nuse in order to determine how many events need to pass until the bus will \narrive (if you don't get what I mean by that, pass it off as irrelevant or \nask me if you wish)\n\nBut science, I feel, is saying it's something physical. And if it's \nsomething physical, then what exactly is 'it'? The form of time changes \ndepending on the variables; such as how slow or how fast you're traveling. \nAnd that to me is where I get stuck in trying to comprehend what exactly \ntime 'is'.\n\nThis may come off as pretty silly, and I can understand why considering so \nmany others I've talked to have had no issues with understanding the \nphysical being of time more so it being purely theoretical as I've always \nseen it to be, but I genuinely want to know and understand how others know \nand understand what time is.\n\nI would appreciate any and all constructive feedback.

They both get up in at 7am and perform the exact same \nroutines, day after day.  We put one on a spaceship traveling very fast and \nthe other remains on earth.  In this case each dies when their clock \nreaches 35 years and each did the exact same amount of tasks.  They each \nbrushed their teeth the same number of times, watched the same amount of \nTV, etc.  In this respect one did not live any \"longer\" than the other and \ndid not do anything more than the other person.  From each persons \nperspective they only lived 35 years, no more and no less.\n\nSecond is we can instantly travel into the future by passing very near or \nthrough a black hole who's gravity condenses both space/time.  So that is \nexactly what we do and travel 300 years into the future in only three \nminutes by our clock as we emerge on the other side.  We claim we instantly \ntraveled into the future!  But someone taps us on the shoulder and says no \nyou didn't.  Year after year we came by and saw you seemingly frozen near \nthe black hole.  You never left us.\n\nNow for the mind twist..\n\nA photon travels at the speed of light because it is light.  At the speed \nof light time comes to a complete stop and space condenses to a single \npoint.  While we can measure the protons progress through space and it's \nlocation every second during the 8 minutes it takes for it to travel from \nthe sun to the earth, to the proton whose time has stopped and space has \ncontracted it sees its origin and destination as being the same place \nand it's travel time was instantaneous.  To the photon there is was no \nspace or time, it is only us who can see the space between its origin and \nend and measure a difference in time it took in its travel.
