However, the build of their \"mouths\" makes it for them \nanatomically impossible to pronounce human words. They know the language, \nbut they cannot speak it themselves. But they still understand what a human \nsays. Same thing with humans - they know the prawn language, but they \ncannot pronounce \"words\" in it. So it is very reasonable that they speak in \ntheir own languages and still understand each other.\ufeff",

Most of resources that you can get on earth you can get in space \nstarting from hydrogen ending in huge comets made from diamonds, silver, \niron, gold... etc etc \nAnd because they have technology, they can just fly to this comet and take \nwhat they need.  \n2. If they would be explorers like most of people think they could have \nship prepared to long travel, with all backup systems you can get, and with \nlots of smaller vehicles/ships that would help you explore new planets, not \nonly with one or two small ships...   \n3. Most of technology, even medical are made because of wars. So its not \nlike just because you have hi tech devices and ships you are ideal species \nthat want to explore space. And its not like just because you have all that \nships you dont need to get resources and fuel when you are in space.\n4. So only reason why Aliens would travel through galaxy it would be to \nfind new places to colonize and store resources and food. because dont \nfoget that Alien or not every living creature need energy, stored as a food \nor any other type of \"energy\" that it can get to live.\nAnd why colonize? Maybe because there is too many creatures in planet, \nproblem with food, sickness, some natural disasters.\nMaybe first plan after gaining hyper-space technology is to get resources, \njust like we doing now. Like latest Rosseta mission, its one of first step \nto get information about this.\nBut something goes wrong: war, natural disaster and we have loots of space \nships that need to find new place to live, and because most of technology \nis made in times of war we have spaceships filed with weapons just to make \nsure you can get food and resources in first planet you encounter.\n\nIn this movie we have such situation, what you need to know more to get it? \n \ufeff",

The control module for the big ship was damaged and fell off \nthe ship to the ground, where the main alien character (Christopher \nJohnson) had hidden it underground. It took him 20 years to repair the \ndamage and find fuel for that control module by refining some liquid that \nwas used in their technology. That's what we see him doing early in \nthe movie. He said that he finally had enough when the eviction from \nDistrict 9 started. But the whole point was, he was going to use that to \nreturn home. We never learn exactly what went wrong, but the implication \nwas that they ended up at Earth by accident. It said that the \nhumans believe the aliens had a caste system and that all of the aliens on \nboard were part of a worker or soldier caste. It was suggested by one human \nthat all of the ruling caste might have been killed in an accident or by \ndisease. We never learn the truth on this, but it's implied that their \nplanet is definitely still there. The humans didn't realize that \nChristopher Johnson was part of a higher caste and smarter than the rest of \nthe aliens. It even tries to show you that he's smarter than the rest with \nhis interaction with his friend at the start.The aliens were not enslaved, \nthey were oppressed. And that's really kind of why the story is in \nJohannesburg. The aliens showed up during the time of Apartheid, then we \nenter the story some 20 years later, Apartheid is over, and whites and \nblacks are BOTH oppressing and exploiting this other disadvantaged group of \npeople.
