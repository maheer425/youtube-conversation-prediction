You suddenly say its like twilight even though you just saw the \ntrailer and how exactly does that make you better than me?)\n\n... Yeah its a \"monster falls in love with pretty girl\" thing... \n\nBut you dont get it. \n\nR wasnt obsessed with Julie, he just wanted to form a bond with her. He \ndidnt push her to love him or anything, he was just there for her when she \nwas in danger. He wanted her safe, he wanted whats best for her. And Julie, \non the other hand, she at first, was wary of him, but when she sees he is \ntrying hard to keep her safe, she warms up bit by bit. \n\nEdward puts bruises on Bella while she sleeps, did R do that? And when \nEdward goes away, what does Bella do? Try her best to kill herself.\n\nYes, its just like twilight.\ufeff",
