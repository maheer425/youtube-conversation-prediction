Two drunk guys aren't gonna \nknow where the cow's centre of mass is.\n\nFurthermore, they aren't trying to accelerate the cow- that would involve \nmoving the whole cow. As was pointed out, this would be very hard. Instead, \nthey are trying to tip the cow, which only requires them to move the cow \nsuch that it will be in unstable equilibrium- that is to say, it will \ntopple. Therefore, we apply the physics of moments m(p)=fd (the moment \nabout a point is equal to the force applied about said point multiplied by \nthe distance between the perpendicular of the acting force and the \npivot) Cows are very top-heavy (big bodies, [relatively] thin legs) meaning \nthey have a high centre of mass, and have very long legs (meaning a larger \nmoment). This makes tipping a cow over relatively easy.\ufeff",
