So you can def add 1 or 2 secs to his \nlap time as he knows how to handle the car better as he does after 2 days \nwith the other ones.\n2. the Porsche GT3 RS is the insane version  of a sports car - the bmw and \nmerc are two insane versions of everyday limos. So if there was a insane \nedition of an Audi RS4, it would be a better car to compare here.\nBut still, fun to watch him drive :)\ufeff",
