General \nAlexander Haig said 2 days after Obama was elected, that over 3 Trillion \ndollars in the \"Pentagon alone\" was unaccounted for, yet never talked about \nagain. The Fraud goes all the way down to our Local Governments, so why is \nthe holy Grail \"Apollo\" exempt?\n\nIf there was no fraud they wouldn't need compartmentalization where - \nnobody knows - what the other guy is doing.

STAGE WHICH DIDNT \nEVEN MAKE IT INTO ORBIT BECAUSE THE FUEL WAS EMPTIED DURING ASCENT!!!\n\nSecond: A free-return trajectory is a trajectory of a spacecraft traveling \naway from a primary body (for example, the Earth) where gravity due to a \nsecondary body (for example, the Moon) causes the spacecraft to return to \nthe primary body without propulsion (hence the term \"free\").\n\nIn the case of the Moon we can distinguish:\n\nA circumlunar free-return trajectory around the Moon. The perilune is \nbehind the Moon; the spacecraft moves there in a direction opposite to that \nof the Moon (the path is 8-shaped).\nA cislunar free-return trajectory. The spacecraft goes beyond the orbit of \nthe Moon, returns to inside the Moon's orbit, moves in front of the Moon \nwhile being diverted by the Moon's gravity to a path away from the Earth to \nbeyond the orbit of the Moon again, and returning to Earth by Earth's \ngravity. The perilune is in front of the Moon; the spacecraft moves there \nin the same direction as the Moon.\nThe flight time for a cislunar free-return trajectory is longer than for a \ncircumlunar free-return trajectory, especially for trajectories with a \nsmall perilune radius (close approach of the Moon): flight time for a \ncislunar free-return trajectory decreases with perilune radius, while \nflight time for a circumlunar free-return trajectory increases with \nperilune radius.\n\nIn the simplified model where the orbit of the Moon around the Earth is \ncircular, the special cases of free-return trajectories in the plane of the \norbit of the Moon are periodic: after passing the Earth the spacecraft \nwould return to the Moon, etc. The same applies of course for similar \nthree-body problems; this problem is an example of a circular restricted \nthree-body problem.\n\nWhile in a true free-return trajectory no propulsion is applied, in \npractice there may be small mid-course corrections or other maneuvers.\n\nA free-return trajectory may be the initial trajectory to allow a safe \nreturn in the event of a systems failure; this was applied in the Apollo 8, \nApollo 10, and Apollo 11 lunar missions. In such a case a free return to a \nsuitable reentry situation is more useful than returning to near the Earth, \nbut then needing propulsion anyway to prevent moving away from it again. \nSince all went well these Apollo missions did not have to take advantage of \nthe free return, and inserted into orbit upon arrival at the Moon.\n\nDue to the landing site restrictions that resulted from constraining the \nlaunch to a free return that flew by the Moon, subsequent Apollo missions, \nstarting with Apollo 12 and including the ill-fated Apollo 13, used a \nhybrid trajectory that launched to a highly elliptical Earth orbit that \nfell short of the Moon with effectively a free return to the atmospheric \nentry corridor. They then performed a mid-course maneuver to change to a \ntrans-Lunar trajectory that was not a free return. This retained the safety \ncharacteristics of being on a free return upon launch, and only departed \nfrom free return once the systems were checked out and the lunar module was \ndocked with the command module, providing back-up maneuver capabilities. In \nfact, within hours after the accident, Apollo 13 used the lunar module to \nmaneuver from its planned lunar orbit insertion trajectory to a free-return \ntrajectory.Apollo 13 was the only Apollo mission to actually turn around \nthe Moon in a free-return trajectory (however, two hours after perilune, \npropulsion was applied to speed the return to Earth by 10 hours and move \nthe landing spot from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean).\n\nThird: I'll explain to you what gravity is so you understand why the \nrotation of a body in space does not accelerate smaller bodies entering \nit's orbit. Gravitation or gravity is a natural phenomenon by which all \nphysical bodies attract each other. Gravity gives weight to physical \nobjects and causes them to fall toward the ground when dropped.\n\nIn modern physics, gravitation is most accurately described by the general \ntheory of relativity (proposed by Einstein) which describes gravitation as \na consequence of the curvature of spacetime. For most situations gravity is \nwell approximated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which \npostulates that the gravitational force of two bodies of mass is directly \nproportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to \nthe square of the distance between them.\n\nPlease, stop and learn about physics and then learn English grammar, thank \nyou, I will end this conversation now because you obviously dont know \nanything about science.",

Do you just look at \nheadlines and draw your own conclusions?\n\n\"I am to send 3 persons throughout radiations that are basically unknown\"\nOh really?

What about the many Luna probes, \nLuna 2 impacting the surface and Luna 9 making the first soft touchdown \n(had to pass through the belts to get there).  What about the Surveyor \nline, including Surveyor III, where Apollo 12 targeted its touchdown?  And \nthose are only SOME of the unmanned probes.\nNow, lets get into manned ones - Gemini X, reaching the lower outskirts of \nthe belts, with no ill effects, so Gemini XI penetrating in a little \ndeeper, no ill effects.\nUnmanned again, Apollo 4 and Apollo 6, full flight models of the \nspacecraft, automated with no crew, penetrating well beyond the densest \nlayers, no significant climb in radiation within the cabin and no damage to \non board systems.\nThen two more manned missions BEFORE Apollo 11, (Apollo 8 and 19.  9 was an \nLEO test of the LM).  And even then, remember the orbit inclination a \nspacecraft follows when launched from Florida?  Last time I checked, \nFlorida is not on the equator.\n\nWhich tests had left pilots barely alive?  Gemini X, Both John Young and \nMichael Collins survived.  Collins became the CMP of Apollo 11, Young the \nCMP of Apollo 10, commander of Apollo 16, and Shuttle Columbia STS-1.  \nBarely alive?\nGemini XI, both Pete Conrad and Dick Gordon survived, and both flew on \nApollo 12, and Conrad flew the first mission to Skylab.  Barely alive?\nApollo 8, Frank Borman, Bill Anders and Jim Lovell survived, and Jim Lovell \nwent on to command Apollo 13, and is still alive and in great health \ntoday.  Barely alive?\n\nThe ONLY mission of the American program that suffered any ill effects on \nits astronauts, from 1961 to 1975 was SA-204 \"Apollo 1\", and that wasn't \neven a mission.  There was clear oversight because of the rushed schedule, \nand poor workmanship on the part of North American Aviation, but it had \nnothing to do with an actual spaceflight mission.\n\nSo once again,... which test mission are you talking about where astronauts \nwere barely alive?",

The flight lasted one day, \nafter which the spacecraft was deorbited ahead of its planned recovery.

To prevent this, an explosive charge was detonated during \nreentry.[3] Both Pchyolka and Mushka were killed in the resulting \ndisintegration.[2] They were the last dogs to die in a Soviet space \nmission, after Laika, who was never intended to survive her Sputnik 2 \nflight, and Chaika and Lisichka, perishing after the rocket carrying their \n\"Korabl Sputnik\" spacecraft disintegrated 20 seconds into the flight.

At least that's what you numbskulls hear.\n\nFor people with more than a remedial grasp of the language, they would have \nunderstood that there's a difference between how a smooth surface reflects \nlight, and how a rough one does.  People who have read nothing more complex \nthan \"Telescopes for Dummies\" will get the concept that \"rough\" and \n\"smooth\" depend on the wavelength hitting it.  What looks smooth to a radio \nsignal can look rough to an optical one.\n\nTake a look again at where the reflection of the sun is--it's on the far \nright side of reflective part of the helmet.  It's a lot closer to being in \nhis right ear than \"in his face\".  The shadow of the reflected astronaut \nshows that.  Funny how you clowns make such a big deal about shadows when \nit suits you, and then ignore it when it doesn't.\n\nThat means that he's at about 60 degrees to the sun.  If the sun was 'in \nhis face\", the reflection wouldn't be off to the side--it would be in the \nmiddle of the shield.  So we can add \"how light reflects off of things\" to \nthe list of stuff you have no clue about.\n\nAs for the \"rectangles\"--I'm wondering if those opaque pieces on the sides \nof the helmet cover might, you know, block light and cause a shadow? \n(especially since that's what they were designed to do).  And before you \nstart gassing on about how there shouldn't be a shadow on one side if there \nwas only one light, look up the term \"indirect lighting\".",

            "text": "+GShock112 Yes, actually I was.  But there's a big difference--the moon \nis much better as a reflector of radio waves than light.\n\nBecause radio waves have a much longer wavelength, small surface \nirregularities don't disrupt the reflection the way they do with light, \nwhich has a much shorter wavelength.  That's one reason that the dish on a \nradio telescope doesn't need to be figured nearly as accurately as an \noptical mirror--your Direct TV dish makes a crap mirror, but it's more than \nsmooth enough to use with the satellite signal.\n\nAt the wavelengths of visible light, the particles making up the lunar soil \nare big enough to spoil the signal.  If you use the 2m band to bounce radio \nsignals off of the moon, something has to be six feet across before it \nstarts to cause problems.\n\nOf course, there are a lot of things on the lunar surface bigger than six \nfeet, which is one reason why the signal loss bouncing radio off of the \nmoon is horrendous--something like 250 dB.  With the more severe \ndisturbance at optical frequencies, there just wouldn't be a recognizable \nsignal.  That's where the LRRs come in--optically precise, and designed to \nreflect the light right back at the source.\n\nAs for your other \"evidence\"--on the Youtube video--of course, it's \nimpossible that they weren't standing exactly facing each other, right?  \nBecause if they weren't, they wouldn't have had to turn very far to get the \nlight on both bubble helmets.\n\nBTW, you might not want to use that video as \"proof\", because it highlights \njust how shallowly you guys think.  He was talking about the horizon height \ncompared to the astronauts and how it changed, which he said is \n\"impossible\".  Yeah, it's impossible--unless one of them was standing in a \nfucking crater.  It's not like you'll find *those* on the moon.\n\nFinally, do you really not understand the difference between taking a photo \nfrom earth that shows a recognizable LM, and shooting a laser at the moon \nand getting some photons back?

As Apollo astronauts will all say they never saw any \nstars with their naked eye. Landers have to land horizontally as it flies \ndown to the moon. Apollo's landers stop in mid air and land straight down, \nwithout creating a crater and the lander managed to be so clean. Real \npictures aren't as picture perfect. The sun will be really really bright. \nWatch some videos on the Chang'e 3 on youtube and see when the lander \nseparates from the rockets. Lots of debris and stuff. Most Apollo videos \nare so clean. Shot in a studio for sure. Anyone who understand photography \nwill tell you in different conditions, cameras will react differently, to \ndust, to bright sun light, to debris being infront of the camera or blurred \nby temperature differnces.

The best you can do is a dot? It takes today's technology \n10 years to build a rover. NASA claimed they sent 20 astronauts to the moon \nfrom 1969-1973. Multiple missions in 4 years! How about this, US had \nannounced it wants to \"go back\" to the moon. I bet the US can't do it today \nin 10 years. The best rocket US has today can barely lift 20 tonnes of \npayload into orbit let alone the moon. Why isn't China putting men on the \nmoon, they got money, can send 3 astronauts into space. According to Tom \nHanks, all you need is a thruster to bring you into orbit of the moon? \nApollo 13 is to brainwash the masses that trip to the moon is possible. \nIt's not.
