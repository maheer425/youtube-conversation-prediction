No wonder the learned professor of Islamic Law saw nothing wrong with \nit. And no wonder why opposition to attempts at imposing a minimum age for \nmarriage in Yemen have been led by muslim clerics.\nSuch is the example of the Prophet - who muslims regard as \"The Perfect \nMan\" (\"al-Ins\u0101n al-K\u0101mil\") or  - \"the person who has reached perfection.\" - \neven the so-called 'moderate' muslims believe that.\n\n \"O Prophet! Why holdest thou to be forbidden that which Allah has made \nlawful to thee?\"  - from the Quran, Surah (chapter) 66, aya (verse) 1.\nNothing to do with Islam?\n\nThere are Muslim clerics who argue well against child marriage but that \ndoes not mean that those in favor of child marriage have no leg to stand on \n- they do. Theirs is a legitimate interpretation of the Quran and the \nSunnah (the norms derived from the words, deeds and practices of the \nProphet). Contrary to the common belief of many Westerners, the Quran is \nnot the sole guide for Muslims; the Sunnah is just or even more important.\n\nThe fact that many islamic countries don't allow it is not because Islam \nprohibits it - far from it; it is because of several reasons:  1) \nIndividual countries ignore the example of the Prophet and use their common \nsense and innate moral compass. They do that by saying that the \"consensus \nof the muslims (ummah)\" has resulted in doing away with a particular \npractice; 2) It is not in the cultural tradition of a given Islamic \ncountry, and 3) because international - meaning Western - values, pressure \nand criticism have actually impacted islamic values.  The latter reason is \nwhy some muslims hate the West. They feel that the West have polluted or \nseduced the 'purity' of Islamic culture.\ufeff",

Unfortunately, women, especially when they are little \ngirls ( under or not at the age of puberty) do not have any right to \noppose; worse, they have the duty - it's an islamic obligation - to accept \nand be \"happy \". In the 21st century, the islamists and their allies want \nthis to be seen and considered as normal.  It will never be the case. For \nhumans, and from a human point of view, the Sharia is anything but Culture. \nOther societies are confronted to similar problems, but with the huge and \n deep differences observed between what derived from \u2013 and is - custom, and \nwhat becomes law, like in islam.   \nAnyway, unfortunately, Women are still seen as goods, a consumer product, \nsex and pleasure machine for men, etc... rather than our equal, and of \ncourse, equal in Freedom and respect. Here lies a basic element of what is \na conflict of civilization we are faced with Islam.\ufeff",
