The point was \"How much energy is required to move Thor's \nHammer when it is at rest?\"  What would happen if you stuck a \n5th-directional push-pin into 3D spacetime?  All the matter in the universe \ncouldn't move it.  Imagine your existence in a piece of flat paper and a \npush-pin point was popped through your flat paper reality.  That is Thor's \nHammer.  You cannot move it because the forces that move it exist outside \nand are way more powerful than your reality (like a push-pin to a bunch of \nline art).  A paper clip would distort your paper-sheet-world spacetime in \nmagnetic-thermal-temporal ways, but you could do nothing about it.  If you \nhad a pad of paper in your paper-sheet-world universe you would have \n\"alternate realities\" \"stacked on top of each other\".  And Thor's Hammer \ncould Godlike-Push-Pin them all.\nYou could fling worlds at the Hammer of Thor and they would be the literal \nmasses encountering a 5th-directional IMMOVABLE OBJECT.  When Thor lifts \nhis hammer, he removes the Godly-Push-Pin from the current location.\nSince Thor's Hammer doesn't rip the world asunder when placed in a \nlocation, I consider it a \"courtesy move\" by Thor.\nHe merely pins it to a relative location on a larger moving object which is \nmoving through space.\ufeff",

When i \nsaw the avengers i got mad sooo many times. first of all Loki is not and \nhas never been Thors Brother. Thors farther Odin and Loki is bloodbrothers \nand Odin has always regretted to let Loki inside Asgard. second of all Hulk \nlifting Thors hammer? nope its motherfucking impossible i hate marvel for \ndoing that and i turned of the movie instantly after that.\nSorry for any spelling/grammatical mistakes English is not my first \nlanguage.\ncheers\ufeff",
