            "text": "I see flirting with girls kind of like how I see a game of high stakes \npoker. You have to read your \"opponent\" and their body language, how they \nact, and what they say. You at the same time make your own bets and ante \nwith what you say, do, or if rather or not you should  try to make physical \ncontact with the girl. Sometimes though if you are lucky, the girl ends up \nmaking the first move. That is like winning in a poker game simply because \nthe other players caused the main opponent with the better hand to fold \nbecause they became intimidated or got bluffed out and folded when they \nshouldn't have. Or in this case you got lucky and a couple of potential \ncock blockers at the bar came up, offended the women, and she came home \nwith you. Although allot of women really don't realize that if they really \nwant a man all they have to do is go up to and talk to them like anyone \nelse. If the guy is talking to you and you have a good conversation going, \nthen he will probably go home with you if you ask. The whole cultural \nstigma of the man being the only one who should ask the women out in my \nopinion is stupid. This isn't the early 1900's or prior. We are in an equal \ngender society now (or at least working toward and getting very close to \nthat) and things should be addressed as so. However now a days it's finally \ngetting to the point where men sleeping around with dozens of women is \nfinally seen as an equally bad thing. I don't know.. call me an idiot but I \nget annoyed or pissed off when I see or hear about a guy that sleeps with \ndifferent women every other night but then calls a women a whore because \nshe wont stay with one man. Sorry but if we want gender equality the same \nstandard should apply. I've never cheated on a women. I've came close but I \nstopped myself. But basically the best way to flirt in my opinion is by \nusing the true and oldest nature of it. Start by subtle and even normal \ntouching in normal social relationships. You then gauge their reaction and \nif they seem relaxed, cool, or better yet happy about that slight touch you \ndo a little bit more and go from there.\ufeff",
