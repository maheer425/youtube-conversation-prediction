I figured you'd need mashed bananas \nobviously (though I'm surprised up to 5 which seems like a lot), flour and \neggs... and that's it, lol.  Goes to show how much is actually involved.  A \nlot of bowls are required too it seems though I don't mind doing dishes.  A \nmixer is a surprise but I guess it shouldn't be.  In other words it's only \na surprise since I don't know much about baking, lol.  I just want banana \nbread darn it!  Sorry sorry, I need to calm down.

Here are some things to check:1 - Did your oven get hot enough? \nYou can double-check the temperature by buying a separate thermometer and \nplacing it inside to see if its temperature reads the same as the oven \ntemperature. \n2 - Was the oven preheated before you put in the bread to cook? \n3 - Were the eggs and bananas at room temperature? They'll mix more easily \nwhen room temperature. \n4 - Also, it's important not to over-beat the batter when folding the \nbananas into the flour mixture. Too much beating will take air out of the \nbatter and keep it from rising. \n5 - Was everything measured accurately? (Here's a link to the original \nrecipe so you may review the ingredients: \nhttp://allrecipes.com/recipe/banana-banana-bread/detail.aspx)\n6 - What size are the bananas? If they're too large, they can add more \nmoisture to the batter and make it harder to rise.\nWe hope you try the recipe again. Let us know if you still have problems.",

It's hard to know exactly what went wrong and \nmake a diagnosis, but a guess about what's happening would focus on the \noven--not anything you did or the recipe. It sounds like the oven's \ntemperature is off. This isn't unusual. Maybe you've noticed it before with \nother things? The best way to check the oven temperature is to buy a small \noven thermometer you can set inside the oven to check the actual \ntemperature against the oven's setting. If there's a difference, you can \nusually recalibrate the oven temperature following instructions in the \nowner's manual. Or you may manually turn the oven down to accommodate the \ndifference. Does your oven have two heat sources? It's possible one is not \nworking, which means all the heat is overcooking the top of the loaf. If \nyou can share anything else about what you noticed, please let us know and \nwe'll offer more ideas.",

Margarines vary a lot in the types of oils used, so \nyou need to look at the labels. Those that contain higher amounts of fats \nare best for baking, as those with less fat will contain more water and \nwill cause tougher baked products. Flavor varies with margarines too, so \nyou need to find one that you like. Hope that helps - Happy Cooking!",
