After an awkward moment and a few smiles from customers, \nthey used to come back and complain that I must have given them a frozen \nbottle and if I could give them another - not frozen bottle. Of course I \ngave them another \"almost frozen\" one. After close inspection they \nconfirmed that the next one is not frozen and went back to table to pour it \nto the same customer, but as soon as they open the top and tilt the bottle, \nit froze again. But the second time usually everyone at the table is \nwatching that happening. Customers always liked this trick. Even though it \nwas a little embarrassing to the waitress, but after receiving extra tips \nthey usually forgave me.\ufeff",
