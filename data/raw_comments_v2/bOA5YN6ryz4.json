On any form of \nlong sweepers or midsize corners the AWD will actually inhibit understeer \nthat the RWD won't experience.  If the 45 here had the same Super Sports \ntires, it would have given the BMW an even bigger beating.  The 320 hp in \nthe BMW isn't enough to overpower the rear tires very much coming out of \ncorners, except maybe the tightest of corners where the car is in the high \nparts of 1st gear or mid 2nd maybe.\n\nTires play a huge role in the performance of a car.  Look at how well the \nR8 V10+ performs on relatively shitty Pirelli PZero's.  If that car put \nsome really sticky Super Sports on, it would be hitting 60 in less than 3 \nsecods easily.",

It's an AMG car, come on! It's about the size of \nthat SLK AMG that Clarkson drove through a simulated urban battlefield on \nTop Gear, and that car is about the size of the A45 AMG so why not a V-8 \nlike they dropped into the SLK AMG? As for the BMW, I think aesthetically \nit has gone downhill since the first 1 series cars, so if it were left to \nme, I'd go with a nice certified pre-owned 1M from a few years back in that \nawesome looking metallic orange color they offered them in. And yes I'm \nbiased a little because I'm an M car nut, particularly the M3 and the M \nRoadster, and I am of the opinion that the 1M was really the true \nmodern-day successor to the original M3 in terms of size and wheelbase. And \nhaving a 3.0L I-6 with either the twin turbos or the single turbo, twin \nscroll setup making as much power as they do can never hurt. If it has to \nbe a hatchback and brand-showoff-ness isn't an issue, then I think that \nrecent hatchback-only generation of Subbie WRX STIs is the way to go, in my \never so humble opinion.\ufeff",
