Hell if your \npoor and get kicked out of the house at 18 (so long as your not a retard) \nyou can join the military and not even have to be in infantry. Your ass can \nsit on a ship, get a skill (mechanic, radar technician, computers, etc), \ntake college classes while in the navy and have your college paid for after \nyou leave. Plus the post 9/11 Gi bill gives you money to have an apartment \nonce your in college. Rules to life. Don't have a child until your \nfinancially ready. Always save save save. Get a skill. Not just a degree \nbut a skill. You may fall on hard times but you will succeed.

John states \nin this video that women make 77 cents to every dollar that men make in the \nUnited States--the same statistic that endless democratic politicians have \nreiterated repeatedly. Let me first say, that I am a relatively liberal \nthinking person and absolutely think that women should be paid equally to \nmen. However, this statistic that is used so frequently is just skewed. \nWomen make less money because by in large, they often go into careers that \nare associated with lower pay, despite being extremely important \ncareers...social work, nursing, education, etc. Also, on average, women \nwork less over the course of a year. Not because they are lazy, but because \nwomen tend to be more family-oriented (this ultimately results in a lower \nincome as well).\nThe statistic does not imply that women are making 77 cents less for the \nexact same job as a man--thats how politicians spin it, but thats not true \nto the statistic. To provide a personal anecdote, my father was head of a \nlocal police department, and thus had access to payment records. Female law \nenforcement officers were provided the exact same opportunities as men \n(annual raises, same starting salary, etc.).\ufeff",

            "text": "There are many indicators that the wage gap is a myth, especially when it \ncomes to saying that equally skilled workers who are women are getting less \nfor their work. Here are some reasons as why that is the case: \n1. The data usually take all women and all men earnings in all occupations \nput them all together and divide by the number of women and men working \nregardless of their specific occupation, experience or skills; \n2, women tend to choose less lucrative occupation, like in child care etc. \nAll this is made by choice. I personally have witnessed very academically \ntalented girls of my age choosing to go to \"easier\" schools to take care of \nkinder garden children for example despite the fact they had the mental \ncapacity and work ethic to get them trough for more challenging (at least \nin academic terms) profession and definitely more lucrative profession than \nthey chose. Sure, they finished school sooner then I would finish law \nschool but take average earnings of a lawyer and a kinder garden teacher... \nyou get the idea.\n It makes up for the much of the difference in overall earnings that men \nmake compared to all women; \n3. women tend to put family first more than men. For some reason it is \nconsidered less valuable than to further your own personal career but you \ncan always look at it from another perspective, she is putting the needs of \nothers above their own personal ambition - it takes a strong, unselfish \nperson to do that.\nIt means that men do more work in paying jobs, but the money a man receives \nis not all his if it's a married man, or a man with children - part of it \nbelongs to his wife or to finance children. It's more common for a man to \nbe working in paying job but it doesn't mean he has more money than his \nwife who is at home because it's their money. Also, a women divorced who \ngets alimony is entitled to part of her ex husband's earnings, but stats \nthat only show working and unemployed would show he got all the money \nmaking huge difference and further creating a myth of wage gap.\n\nI've read a study that women tend to be more critical towards their own \nwork and therefor less likely to ask for a raise - this actually goes in \nfavor of the original statement that women of equal skill are payed less \nthan men, but if you go to your boss with: \"Pay me more or I am out\" \nattitude you are risking losing your job, so maybe women are being more \ncareful, which is consistent with the fact that women take less risks than \nmen. It may seem unfair at first but that's how women and men generally are \ndifferent - no one says it's unfair that men tend to lose their lives in \naccidents more because we all know men tend to do more crazy stuff. Nature \nof men to take risks by has some rewards but a huge downside as well.\ufeff",

For a Hussein to be armed first by US in the early 90's, \nand then taking him down with European allies, where nobody should have \nbeen, creating ten times more extreme ISIS in a process. Endless cycle, \nthat got nothing to do with \"protecting\" anybody. Western European \ncountries and North America remain to be close allies, but after Iraq much \nof the western Europe has started questioning some of US's actions military \nwise. \n\nAlso I don't know how well you are aware about geopolitics, but \"just \ninvading\" Denmark and Ukraine is a bit different to put it slightly. One is \na country that had a pro Russian dictator just couple of years ago and was \npart of Soviet Union till the 90's with over 23% of ethnic Russian's and \nmany more pro Soviets/Russians. Country that is not part of European Union, \nNATO or any other big western institution that would tie it to West. \n Another is a rich western country, that is part of European union, NATO, \nNordic defence union (pretty much gathering all western countries as ally). \nAttacking any of these European union or NATO countries would mean WW3.",

But taxing an \nindividual to run a government is needed and necessary.  However, when \ngovernment applies taxes to \"\"things\"\" like Death or the taking of money \nfrom people who don't earn much to begin with is the crime of government.\n\nFor instance.\n\nwhen a person dies the people inheriting the money may have to a pay a tax. \n Why, that dollar has already been taxed.  Why should those receiving the \nmoney be taxed on that money that has already been taxed?\n\nWhy should a person making $15,000 a year gross income pay a tax of $500 or \n$700 dollars?  If the objective is to LIFT that person out of poverty is \nthe goal than would it not make sense not to tax that individual?\n\nNational Parks do you mean like Yellow Stone?  Yellow Stone woods, and open \ngrasslands have existed for 100,000 of thousands of years with no \ngovernment involvement. Same is true for the Grand Canyon.  Why do we need \na parks and recreation department to keep those areas open? Are they not \nalready open spaces to enjoy?\n\nSure we use tax ,money to maintain structures such as the Lincoln, \nJefferson, Washington homes, monuments.  But did we really need to close \ndown the World War II Memorial during the last government shut down?  Whats \nthe point, its OUTSIDE anyway.   It continues to be OUTSIDE.\n\nEveryday Government is involved in your life from how much water your \ntoilet uses, shower head uses, dishwasher uses.  Government sets standards \non cars, trucks, power equipment.  Government sets safety requirements. \n Government tells mattress manufactures, bed sheet makers, blanket \ncompanies what they can and can not use as material for those products.\n\nI am NOT saying that a mattress, bed sheet, blanket company should  Willie \nNilly use flammable materials, but its the FREE MARKET that decides that. \n Example if you could purchase a Comforter for a bed and you knew the \nmaterial inside was highly flammable would you buy it? I would hope not, \nand therefore because people don't buy that product the company goes out of \nbusiness.\n\nYEARS before Ralph Nader, car companies were already designing safety \nfeatures into vehicles because that's what people wanted, safer cars.  Did \nRalph Nader's involvement speed it up sure it did...but I ask you why can't \nI buy with out seat belts?  Because the Laws in some states require you to \nwear them...requiring said item just jacks up the price of a car...right?\n\nMy point is this, we need government but not the nanny state we have today.",

Unfortunately, that is not entirely so with \nwomen. \nI do agree with you on one point, that a women can achieve her goals \nthrough hard work (if you are rich, educated, childless, and preferable \nwhite). There are no set rules to prevent a women from doing that nowadays, \nbut we have to take a look at the deeper story to understand why there is a \ngender pay gap and why women are entering lower pay occupations. The story \nisn't as simple \"they chose to\" \n1.) Exposure\nThere are not many successful women figures our children can look up to, in \nreal-life or in media. Only about 20% of parliament are made up of women \n(The US ranks second to last, only beating Japan), there has been no female \npresident in the US history, and even in media a women's measured by her \nlooks. What is it telling our children, that there are no powerful women \nwho achieved their success through \"hard work\" AKA the American Dream? It \nwould be a lie to say, that these exposures to what an \"Ideal women\" should \nbe, does not affect our children. These are messages deep-rooted into them \nfrom birth, something that they can't simply \"ignore\". \n2.) Sexism \nSexism is hardly ever the only reason to the gender pay gap. Would it not \nsound appealing to you as a CEO, to pay a portion of your workers 20% less, \nfor reasons you don't need to justify yourself? Of course, genuine \nworkplace sexism does exist. There are many studies that compare salary of \nwomen and men from the same occupation with the same education, which still \nshows the gender pay gap. Choosing to enter a lower paying job, is a lousy \nexcuse to cover up the issue. Really, with a history of male-only workers \nand gender stereotypes, why would the gender pay gap surprise you? \n3.) Social Pressure \nIf our wonderful girls in school spend their time chasing the American \nDream instead of doing makeup and suffering from body image anxiety issues, \nthey would be a lot more productive no? But it is not \"their choice\" to \nsuffer from anorexia, it is not \"their choice\" for feeling the need to be \nsexually appealing to be accepted. Children, like a piece of clay, are \neasily moulded by their environment and society. Like I have stated above, \nthey learn from taking in what is shown to them. They can't just disregard \nsocial pressure, tell a man in the 50s to become a stay-at-home dad while \nhis wife supports him and disregard the pressure. (A bit overdramatic, but \nyou get my point) \n4.) Childbirth \nAs if childbirth should ever be a reason against women, because it is never \none gender that is responsible for a pregnancy. Even though the American \nsociety is aging at a lower pace than Japan (but still aging), childbirth \nshould never ever ever be the reason 50% of the workforce should be \npenalized. I will go more into the consequences in the next post.",

This isn't a one-of-a-kind finding either. It has been repeated \nin small and large companies and even in lab settings. That's not to say \nthere isn't also evidence that DOES correlate monetary incentive with \ncreative performance. Nonetheless, we can no longer make the assumption \nthat lessening massive wages will lead to a significant decrease in \ninnovation. There are likely more complicated factors at work (namely \norganizational/systematic features, like skill-building and autonomy.)\n\nIn addition, a fallacy arises when you compare high taxes to removing \nincentive because it implies a kind of false dichotomy. You are not \nactually removing the incentive when you raise taxes, only lessening it. \nThere are clear diminishing returns on the amount of productivity that can \nbe inspired by more incentive, and so it's obvious you can only follow that \nless tax, more productivity logic so far up the wage ladder. Gallup surveys \neven revealed that happiness typically stops increasing around $75k/year in \nterms of wage increases. So fighting to protect wealth from taxes, \nespecially when you reach that fairly wealthy level, is self-defeating. \ufeff",
