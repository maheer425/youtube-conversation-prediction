            "text": "Usually when they make a movie based on animes or video games, it goes like \nthis:\n1.They search around titles which have a large audience. \n2.They go shopping and buy the rights to use the title to make a movie (you \ncan also blame the japanese who sell the rights without any restrictions or \nany supervisions on how the final product will be. It was funny how Uwe \nBoll was kicked out by Blizzard when he tried to buy the rights for a \nWarcraft movie)\n3. The most idiotic movie producer gets the oportunity to make the movie, \nwho never even saw the show, he doesn't have ANY idea what is about.\n4. That movie producer takes a pen and a paper and is asking a guy who saw \nthe movie to tell him a couple of things about who the fuck the characters \nare and what the fuck is the story about. It goes like this:\n\"So about the characters...\"\n\"well there's this guy Goku, he's strong, he can beat others....\"\n\"Okay... Goku...strong...throws kicks and punches, noted. Enough about him, \nnext\"\n\"later he marries with ChiChi...\"\n\"Chichi... wife. noted. NEXT!\"\n\"there's Yamcha, Bulma...\"\n\"are those women?\"\n\"Bulma is a girl...\"\n\"...girl. Okay, others\"\n\"His... his grandfather Gohan finds him and raises him but later dies\"\n\"Bulma's?\"\n\"No, Goku's grandfather. And later He's trained by Roshi, who's living \nalone in a...\"\n\"Yeah, okay what's the plot?\"\n\"Well there are seven Dragon Balls to be collected which can Summon Shenron \nand the dragon is making your wish come true...\"\n\"Ooookay... Thank you. And send me an email with some pictures about how \nthose dragonballs look like. See you later then.\"\n\"That's enough? I mean he has friends and others that might be important to \nthe story\"\n\"There are enough characters. I have to go now, I have an appointment\"\n5. This movie producer makes a movie based on that information given to him \nin a short time.\n\nAnd they do exactly this with MANY titles. Those guys who are making the \nmovies NEVER saw the anime, or games they made movies about. They just \nbought the rights based on the numbers of audiences. That is a real insult.\ufeff",
