I have seen every gory film under the sun soooo it doesn't really \naffect me o.o I enjoyed the traps too XD In my opinion it's the best serial \nkiller film out there.

I felt like I was watching \ndeadman wonderland in a sense only without collars of poison or the dead \nman fights and the wheel of torture... Oh wait they did have a wheel of \ntorture XD In a sense. o...o But I digress saw to me is the most demented \nand twisted you can get. Because they are all given a chance to live and \nescape but if they fail they die and it's basically their fault for not \nobeying the psycho's rules XD\n\nMeh it was super enjoyable how everything fits together all you gotta get \npast is the gore and the gross stuff. If you have a strong stomach like me \n( Iron stomach ) Then by the end you will be like \" NEVER SAW THAT COMING! \n\" No pun intended XD the sad thing though o..o Is to see all the \nconnections you need to watch all seven movies within a few nights XD like \nwatch a marathon then you are like NO WAY IT FITS TOGETHER! XP I enjoy that \nit does have a plot. >o> it's not just traps and gore. But the first one \nreally wasn't all that great it got better as it went XD\ufeff",
