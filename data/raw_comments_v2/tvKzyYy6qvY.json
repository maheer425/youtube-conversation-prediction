It's about love and pain and joy and hope. I \nreally believe this movie can inspire someone to change their life if it's \nheaded down the wrong path. It helped change mine. The writing, acting, \ndirecting, soundtrack and score are 10s across the board. What more can you \nask for?\ufeff",

That being said, it's PG-13. But that's early 90's PG-13 so \nby today's parenting standards it's probably rated X, as these days kids \ncan't be exposed to anything other than pretty rainbows and unicorns, and \nparents can't even put their kid in a car without strapping them down like \nthey're on Apollo 11. #3- Let your kid be a kid.
