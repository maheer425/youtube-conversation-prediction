Let's start with \nnumber one: something from nothing.\n\nFrom my knowledge of modern physics (which is admittedly amateur), reality \nis not said to have sprung from nothing. As you said, that would break \ncausality. Rather, reality has always existed (though not our particular \nuniverse). And the big bang is part of some cyclical mechanism from which \nour universe emerges.\n\nBut that's theory and unknowable (currently, anyway). It also doesn't \nmatter since there is a better argument.\n\nIf it's required for *the universe* to have a cause, it follows that a \n*creator* must also have a cause. If you hold that causality is axiomatic, \nthen it must hold true universally. If reality had to be created then a \ncreator must also require a creator and so forth.",

            "text": "+slicedtoad I have a lot more sympathy for people leaving cults after I \nspent about six months weighing what I'd have to believe if the world were \nnot the way I'd been raised to think it was. Holding two conflicting \nviewpoints at the same time when you're not sure which is correct is a kind \nof mental anguish that I had never before experienced, and it went on \nwithout letup unless I tried very hard not to think about it, and I hope to \nnever experience it again.\n\nEventually I figured out this much, from which I was able to build most of \nthe rest of what I believe now (less certain than I was growing up, but on \na more solid foundation, I think):\n\nIn order for this reality to exist without any intelligent force behind its \ncreation, there would have to be:\n\n1. *Something* that came from *nothing*.\n2. *Energy* that came from *nonenergy*.\n3. *Matter* that came from *nonmatter*.\n4. *Order* that came from *chaos*.\n5. *Information* that came from *noninformation*.\n6. *Life* that came from *nonlife* (several factors, including eating and \nexcreting, growing, reproducing).\n7. *Sexual reproduction* that came from *asexual reproduction* (and note \nthat this has to happen to two separate entities at the same time).\n8. *Memory* that came from *nonmemory*.\n9. *Sentience* that came from *nonsentience*.\n10. *Creativity* that came from *noncreativity*.\n11. *Morality* that came from *amorality* (because torturing an infant for \nyour own amusement is wrong for any being at any time in any culture in all \nrealities, and if this fact is not true then everything else, *everything* \nelse breaks into shards and nothing matters).\n\n...pretty sure I had more than that but it's late and I can't remember them.\n\nAnyway, the first one breaks the idea of causality, the second breaks the \nidea of thermodynamics, the fourth breaks the idea of entropy, and the list \nin general makes a sense of probability meaningless. Without *compelling* \nevidence that these things all happened, I can't bring myself to believe \nthem because they are patently ridiculous. It's like trying to believe in a \nlibrary without any authors or, perhaps more accurately, a Steam library \nwithout any programmers.\n\nThat plus the variety of symbiotic lifeforms got me from nothing to the \nidea of some form of powerful, super-intelligent designer. And I don't know \nany way to conceive that other than theism. So I started investigating \ntheism variants to see which one made the most sense.\n\nRegardless, I'll never be able to believe my way back down that list again. \nSo that's a kind of solid ground for me, at least.\n\nP.S. If you see two identical beings who seem to be Johnny Depp, and find \nthat it is impossible to tell which one is the real Johnny Depp and which \none is actually a robot duplicate, because the robot duplicate is just that \ngood at duplicating Johnny Depp (up to and including organic processes such \nas eating food), does it make any sense at all to ask who designed a robot \nthat well but *not* ask a similar question about the designer of Johnny \nDepp himself?",

In fact, many \nsociologists argue that your early-life environment entirely determines how \nyou think (so basically \"who you are\").\n\nOf course, the obvious counter is \"but I left that\" (rebelled, shed, \ndistanced, rejected, etc). The somewhat depressing reality is that almost \neveryone just manages to flip to the other side of the coin.\n\nMoving to the opposite of something does not free you from it's influence. \nYour actions are still \"slave\" to it, just inverted. Your mind still \nprocesses things in the same irrational way. This is almost never \nrecognized by the individual, but quite agreed upon by sociologists.\n\nLet's look at Atheists. Notice I'm using a capitol 'A'. I'm not discussing \nthe scientific perspective on deities. *That* perspective has been quite \ngood at moving progress forward.\n\nBut for the group that does not practice anything related to science and \nyet *defines (labels) themselves by their non-belief in a deity*... They \nare just as trapped in dogma as their religious counterparts.\n\nThe theist judges values based on *ethos* (authority). An argument \nsupported by an appeal to authority is not *always* wrong, of course. If a \nbiologist says something about biology, it makes sense to weigh his \nargument higher than someone else's.\n\nBut to make all you life decisions based on the say-so of a church leader \nis insane. *Likewise to make ethical, social or political judgement based \non the authority of a physicist.*\n\nSo, unless you are exceptional (literally), to actually escape the \nreligious \"chains\", you need to become very introspective. Question \neverything about yourself. Critique every thought, especially those related \nto ethics and identity. Go back over your values and try to find their \nsource.\n\nFind the areas of your mind that are painful. The parts you shy away from. \nThat's where your dogma is.\n\nLook at the values that you despise. Why do you despise them? Is it in \nreaction to your upbringing? That's bias. Kill it with fire (or \nrealistically, by chipping away at it).\n\nOr don't. Just be part of the post-christian Atheist crowd, rebelling but \nnot actually changing except in name. Eventually, I imagine the dogma will \nfade and is hopefully replaced by something healthier. But it'd be nice if \nit would happen sooner rather than a century from now.",

Do not waste your time worrying what others have or what \nthey inherit.(By the way, you will likely inherit more than I will)\n\nWhen you say I would have been a progressive in the past... I have been a \nprogressive in the past.  When I speak with local progressives at my door \nwhen they want me to recall the Republican Gov Walker, they even tell me I \nshould be one of them, as I am more progressive than them in many ways(avid \norganic gardener, drive a ultra low emmision Honda), but I do not vote \nleft, and I do not covet what others have, I do not support \"man made \nclimate change\" that is intended it pass carbon taxes and credits, and I \nstrongly support the 2nd amendment after being pistol whipped during an \narmed robbery in 2004.\n\nHealth and safety are my two greatest interests in life, and I feel \ncarrying a concealed firearm is the safest thing a person can do.  Months \nafter I was pistol whipped, Wisconsin passed a concealed carry bill, only \nto have Dem Gov Jim Doyle veto the bill.  His mansion was less than one \nmile from the business I was working at when pistol-whipped, and he had \narmed guards on the States dime at said mansion... Fucking hypocrite.\n \nIt took Republican Gov Scott Walker to get Wisconsin's concealed carry bill \npassed, and thankfully I am now and licensed to carry, and I carry each and \nevery day.  The Leftists said the sky would fall...\n\nI could go into the health aspects, but I'm just going to end this here, \nbut I did want to reply to your comment about how \"There still should be a \nregulation on how much fish a single person gets\"  There is(1 per day), and \nno muskie fisherman Ever keeps or intentionally kills a single fish.  We \ntake quick photos, and we quickly release them... Most have spent hundreds \nin safe release equipment(I sold my Beckman release net for $100 used!) and \na proper hook cutter(Knipex) is $50 alone.  Any muskie fisherman that \naccidently kills a muskie takes a ton of shit from every other fisherman \nfor doing so.  When water temps reach 80Fdegrees, 99% quit fishing because \nit is too hard on the fish.\n\nWe fish for photos alone, and if guys catch one stupid huge(well over 50\") \nthey may spend $500+ on a fiberglass replica.... Would you still like to \nplace a limit on how many fish a single person can catch?\n\nPS. Back to a Hendrix quote I made in an earlier post \"When the power of \nlove overcomes the lover of power, the World will know peace\"  As long as \nwe keep putting those in power that desire power, we have the wrong people \nrunning the show. The community organizers that are always speaking about \nwhat others have, are doing so to manipulate you for your vote so they can \nachieve power.  Just like Animal Farm.\n\n Look into Dr Ben Carson the brain surgeon.  The man did not want to run \nfor President, but after years of folks begging him to run he is \nconsidering it.  He is a brilliant Black brain surgeon that came from the \nbottom, and worked his way to the top... And most leftists hate him.  I do \nnot yet know enough about him to say I would vote for him, but he sure \nwould make for an interesting candidate coming form outside politics.
