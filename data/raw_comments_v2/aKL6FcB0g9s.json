Of course, they \ndon't roll out patches every week, yes, but they give time to people to \nadjust and savor the new stuff. League is always rushing somewhere, \nconstantly changing stuff for no reason, really and doing a half-assed job \nat it and it's a shame.\nI'll probably try it out when it will come out, but I'm getting really \ntired of changing things for the sake of changing them.\nIf it's not broken, don't fix it. If it is, do it all-out and release one \nbig patch. That's my 5 cents. \ufeff",
