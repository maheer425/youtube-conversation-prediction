And all his follows are dumber than Justin \nBieber fans. Let's not forget this is the same dude who cared so much about \nthe poor crashed and burned in a Half-a-million dollar car. AND YES I KNOW \nHE WASN'T DRIVING!!..Everyone who last saw him and his 'race car driver' \nfriend said they were going out to test the speed of that car. This dude \ntold kids to don't speed because F/F movies had stuntmen and professional \ndrivers, then he goes out and sit in the passenger seat next to a speed \ndemon. Lets use common sense for once. Paul Walker said don't cry for him \nif he died speeding, those are the words of an adrenalin junkie, so I'm not \ngoin to cry for him, in fact fuk him. And don't give me this crap about his \ncharity work because there are plenty of  people alive right now tht devote \ntheir lives to charity work who don't speed\ufeff",
