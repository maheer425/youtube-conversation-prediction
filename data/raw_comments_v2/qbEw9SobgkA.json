The warming trend idea is not \"and \ntherefore your zip code will be x degrees warmer year round,\" it is the \nfact that the average temperature over the entire Earth increases.  So \nwhile you may be cold right now, you are not feeling the average \ntemperature of the Earth, you are feeling your local weather.\n\nAdding energy to a system like this is not going to just flat out up the \ntemperature by a certain amount and do nothing else.  Instead, climate \nchange is expected to increase the extremes in local weather (exactly what \nyou are feeling now, an extreme in weather.)  The southern hemisphere, on \nthe other hand, is getting the opposite effect right now, it certainly \nisn't having a record breakingly cold summer.  The increases in temperature \nelsewhere are greater than the decreases in temperature you are feeling \nlocally.\n\nIt is also worth noting that not all of the increased energy goes into heat \nenergy (hence the misleading nature of \"global warming.\")  Lots of the \nenergy goes to increase the kinetic energy of the atmosphere of the Earth \nas a whole, which would mean more churned up air and bigger storms.  The \nkind of churned up air that could, for example, bring cold polar air \nfurther south than it normally goes (polar vortex style.)\n\nSo in summary, the record breaking winter fits well with the predictions of \nglobal climate change.",
