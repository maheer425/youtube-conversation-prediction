Since the valve/block assembly is \ndisconnected from the system, there is no pressure in the load spring's \nchamber (the hole minute 3:37) since it drains to tank. Any backpressure on \ntank line is aditive to the valve seting for this reason. Some PORV's have \nthe spring chamber vented indepdently. I hope my note is helpful.\ufeff",
