Even lovelier that you decided to put such a great message into your \nvideo to reach a rather big audience... that is the kind of compassion we \nshould all have for one another. Lilian's story brought me right back to \nlast summer, when I built a school in Zambia with my friends. Wonderful \nexperience, and I honestly believe that donating either time, money or \nother things to people who need it most is the least we can do!\nGreat work on these videos and messages, keep up the awesome work Ann!\ufeff",
