The only things that matter are facts and data.\n\nThe economy is in much better health than it was in 2008. Stock indexes are \nuniformly up, as are home prices, the GDP, industrial production, etc. Job \ngrowth is sluggish, but that's completely expected coming out of a \nrecession. Debt is an issue--putting two wars on a largely Chinese credit \ncard and slashing taxes on the rich is, as it turns out, a bad idea--but \nit's not really much of an issue, and austerity is a terrible solution. \nNational debt isn't household debt, they don't work the same way at all, \nand America has been borrowing less from abroad since 2008 than it has in \ndecades. The real concern is the decline in median household income, which \nis a systemic and nonpartisan problem relating to the age of the workforce \nand systematic changes in the makeup of our economy. Look for both \nhousehold income and unemployment to shift as the boomers continue to \nretire, but I wouldn't count on the former going up as the latter goes \ndown. The transition to a service and subsequently a knowledge economy has \nleft us without a middle class structure, and NOBODY knows how to solve \nthat yet. We may even bridge to post-sufficiency in the next century, but \nour collective apparent loathing of the welfare state makes us uniquely \nill-suited to it.",
