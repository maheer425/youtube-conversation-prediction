Same with raising taxes adequately to pay for the programs.\n\nThey could borrow money, but there's a problem with new Texas currency--it \nwon't have the guarantees or buying power the American dollar would have \nwith the other 49 states backing it, so their credit rating will be shaky \nat first and interest rates would high, supressing potential new investment.\n\nPlus Texas now has to pay for its own national defense.  The US owns all \nthe US military assets in Texas and would likely shut down its bases or \nwithdraw its forces. Some bases may stay open through a rental agreement \nwith the US, like the US has with other countries, but it would be for only \na handful of facilities So that leaves Texas only with what its National \nGuard has and lots of Rednecks with small arms, which they're going to \nlearn can't really defend them from any kind of serious external threat. \n So they'd have to invest in that, and in turn would lead either to \nborrowing, higher taxes, and/or deep cuts, all of which will be unpopular \nand could lead to unrest.\n\nBut there's more!  No feds mean they have to pay for their own border \nsecurity with Mexico, so they'd have to pay for all the manpower there too. \n   Given how xenophobic Texas is right now, that's another huge expense \nadded to the ledger.\ufeff",

They will together constitute a federal \nrepublic: their joint deliberations will not impair the sovereignty of each \nmember, though they may, in certain respects, put some restraint on the \nexercise of it, in virtue of voluntary engagements. A person does not cease \nto be free and independent, when he is obliged to fulfil engagements which \nhe has voluntarily contracted.*\n\nThis ties into Federalist No. 39:\n*On examining the first relation, it appears, on one hand, that the \nConstitution is to be founded on the assent and ratification of the people \nof America, given by deputies elected for the special purpose; but, on the \nother, that this assent and ratification is to be given by the people, not \nas individuals composing one entire nation, but as composing the distinct \nand independent States to which they respectively belong. It is to be the \nassent and ratification of the several States, derived from the supreme \nauthority in each State, the authority of the people themselves.

It must result from the UNANIMOUS assent of the several States \nthat are parties to it, differing no otherwise from their ordinary assent \nthan in its being expressed, not by the legislative authority, but by that \nof the people themselves. Were the people regarded in this transaction as \nforming one nation, the will of the majority of the whole people of the \nUnited States would bind the minority, in the same manner as the majority \nin each State must bind the minority; and the will of the majority must be \ndetermined either by a comparison of the individual votes, or by \nconsidering the will of the majority of the States as evidence of the will \nof a majority of the people of the United States. Neither of these rules \nhave been adopted.*\n*Each State, in ratifying the Constitution, is considered as a sovereign \nbody, independent of all others, and only to be bound by its own voluntary \nact. In this relation, then, the new Constitution will, if established, be \na FEDERAL, and not a NATIONAL constitution.*\n--The Federalist Papers : No. 39\nSo the USA is a federal republic, not a national one-- i.e. a purely \n*voluntary* association of sovereign nations, each ruled supremely by its \n*People.*\nThus since the states were legally sovereign nations by law,  the Lincoln \nregime accomplished its war by lies and *censorship,* locking up anyone who \ntold this truth, and even toruturing them with horrible tortures including \nshoving hoses down their throats and filing their lungs with water until \nthey exploded, in addition to running concentration-camps for anyone who \nresisted. THAT'S how they won the war.\nHowever with the internet and other modern technology, there's no longer \nany way to do this and get away with it; and so once the truth is known, \nthe end of tyranny will come not with a shout, but with a Twitter. Like \nwhen Mayor Daley's police beat up the Chicago protestors of the Vietnam \nwar, \"the whole world is blogging.\"\nIn contrast, here's the White House's official response to Texas's petition \nfor secession: \n*Our founding fathers established the Constitution of the United States \"in \norder to form a more perfect union\" through the hard and frustrating but \nnecessary work of self-government. They enshrined in that document the \nright to change our national government through the power of the ballot -- \na right that generations of Americans have fought to secure for all. But \nthey did not provide a right to walk away from it. As President Abraham \nLincoln explained in his @19 in 1861, \"in contemplation of universal law \nand of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual.\"*\nAs proven by the above passages, this is clearly a lie. And once this lie \nis exposed, and the People of each state learn that their state IS a \nsovereign nation-- and that they ARE the ruling sovereigns--  then that \nwill be the end of it, states will secede at whim..... just like they can \nsecede from the UN.\n\"The pen is mightier than the sword.. and the truth shall set you free.\" \n--Lord Byron and John 8:32\ufeff",

They will together constitute a federal \nrepublic: their joint deliberations will not impair the sovereignty of each \nmember, though they may, in certain respects, put some restraint on the \nexercise of it, in virtue of voluntary engagements. A person does not cease \nto be free and independent, when he is obliged to fulfil engagements which \nhe has voluntarily contracted.*\n\nThis ties into Federalist No. 39:\n*On examining the first relation, it appears, on one hand, that the \nConstitution is to be founded on the assent and ratification of the people \nof America, given by deputies elected for the special purpose; but, on the \nother, that this assent and ratification is to be given by the people, not \nas individuals composing one entire nation, but as composing the distinct \nand independent States to which they respectively belong. It is to be the \nassent and ratification of the several States, derived from the supreme \nauthority in each State, the authority of the people themselves. The act, \ntherefore, establishing the Constitution, will not be a NATIONAL, but a \nFEDERAL act.*\n*That it will be a federal and not a national act, as these terms are \nunderstood by the objectors; the act of the people, as forming so many \nindependent States, not as forming one aggregate nation, is obvious from \nthis single consideration, that it is to result neither from the decision \nof a MAJORITY of the people of the Union, nor from that of a MAJORITY of \nthe States. It must result from the UNANIMOUS assent of the several States \nthat are parties to it, differing no otherwise from their ordinary assent \nthan in its being expressed, not by the legislative authority, but by that \nof the people themselves. Were the people regarded in this transaction as \nforming one nation, the will of the majority of the whole people of the \nUnited States would bind the minority, in the same manner as the majority \nin each State must bind the minority; and the will of the majority must be \ndetermined either by a comparison of the individual votes, or by \nconsidering the will of the majority of the States as evidence of the will \nof a majority of the people of the United States. Neither of these rules \nhave been adopted.*\n*Each State, in ratifying the Constitution, is considered as a sovereign \nbody, independent of all others, and only to be bound by its own voluntary \nact. In this relation, then, the new Constitution will, if established, be \na FEDERAL, and not a NATIONAL constitution.*\n--The Federalist Papers : No. 39\n\n\nSo the USA is a federal republic, not a national one-- i.e. a purely \n*voluntary* association of sovereign nations, each ruled supremely by its \n*People.*-- who simply *delegated* powers to the federal government on a \nvoluntary basis, as with any treaty between separate sovereign nations. \n\n\n\n(In short, the \"Supremacy clause\" never relinquishes the national \nsovereignty of any state or its People, though small minds are known to \ninfer things not present or intended. On the contrary, the entire \nConstitution simply *delegates* powers to the federal government, by the \nvoluntary will of the sovereign ruling People of each sovereign nation or \n\"state.\"\nObviously you ignored my entire previous post, or were unable to comprehend \nit.) \n\nThus since the states were legally sovereign nations by law,  the Lincoln \nregime accomplished its war by lies and *censorship,* locking up anyone who \ntold this truth, and even toruturing them with horrible tortures including \nshoving hoses down their throats and filing their lungs with water until \nthey exploded, in addition to running concentration-camps for anyone who \nresisted. THAT'S how they won the war, i.e. ruthless conquest. It wasn't \nany \"insurrection.\"\n\nAnd that's what you're parroting for now-- your own enslavement.....like \nthe \"useful idiot who sells you the rope to hang him with.\". \n\n\"I will concede on Jefferson in the convention he did not participate but \nin my defense he was listed as a delegate from Virginia. \"\n\nNo.  He was an appointee but not a delegate... it seems you have trouble \nwith many words and their correct meanings, as well as facts.",

On any other hypothesis, the delegation of judicial power \nwould annul the authority delegating it; and the concurrence of this \ndepartment with the others in usurped powers, might subvert forever, and \nbeyond the possible reach of any rightful remedy, the very Constitution \nwhich all were instituted to preserve.*\n\nGet that? \"On any other hypothesis, the delegation of judicial power would \nannul the authority delegating it--\" i.e. the *People* of the individual \nstate against which their law was being applied. So the People of a state, \nbeing its ruling sovereigns, could vote in convention to overrule the \nfederal government. \n\nAccordingly, he also wrote:\n\n*The other position involved in this branch of the resolution, namely, \n\"that the states are parties to the Constitution,\" or compact, is, in the \njudgment of the committee, equally free from objection. It is indeed true \nthat the term \"states\" is sometimes used in a vague sense, and sometimes in \ndifferent senses, according to the subject to which it is applied. Thus it \nsometimes means the separate sections of territory occupied by the \npolitical societies within each; sometimes the particular governments \nestablished by those societies; sometimes those societies as organized into \nthose particular governments; and lastly, it means the people composing \nthose political societies, in their highest sovereign capacity. Although it \nmight be wished that the perfection of language admitted less diversity in \nthe signification of the same words, yet little inconvenience is produced \nby it, where the true sense can be collected with certainty from the \ndifferent applications. In the present instance, whatever different \nconstruction of the term \"states,\" in the resolution, may have been \nentertained, all will at least concur in that last mentioned; because in \nthat sense the Constitution was submitted to the \"states;\" in that sense \nthe \"states\" ratified it; and in that sense of the term \"states,\" they are \nconsequently parties to the compact from which the powers of the federal \ngovernment result.*\n*It appears to your committee to be a plain principle, founded in common \nsense, illustrated by common practice, and essential to the nature of \ncompacts, that, where resort can be had to no tribunal superior to the \nauthority of the parties, the parties themselves must be the rightful \njudges, in the last resort, whether the bargain made has been pursued or \nviolated. The Constitution of the United States was formed by the sanction \nof the states, given by each in its sovereign capacity. It adds to the \nstability and dignity, as well as to the authority, of the Constitution, \nthat it rests on this legitimate and solid foundation. The states, then, \nbeing the parties to the constitutional compact, and in their sovereign \ncapacity, it follows of necessity that there can be no tribunal, above \ntheir authority, to decide, in the last resort, whether the compact made by \nthem be violated; and consequently, that, as the parties to it, they must \nthemselves decide, in the last resort, such questions as may be of \nsufficient magnitude to require their interposition.*\n\nAnd that includes both nullification and secession.\n\n\"Perhaps you should have taken your own advice and remained silent.  I am \nnot the coward hiding behind the picture of a Great American President, who \nincidentally was at the Constitutional Convention that devised the \nRepublic. \"\n\nThat would be some trick, considering that he was ambassador to *France* at \nthe time, and his interaction was strictly via correspondence... which only \nunderscores your abysmal ignorance. \n\nI use Jefferson's picture because I preserve the integrity of his \nintentions against dweeb-faced noobs who distort it, talking right out of \nyour assholes having grown arrogant  in your 7th-grade classes in history \nre-written by the victors.

I do believe that our central \ngovernment is ever so slowly turning the tables and taking some power away \nfrom the states. It has not yet reached the point as to strike at \nFederalism, a principle of the Constitution, but it may get there. As of \nright now, the division and distribution of power in the national \ngovernment, and the smaller state governments is for the most part, \nbalanced.

The Berlin Conference broke up a culturally unified Africa into \nover 50 disunited and culturally conflicted countries, so that European \ncountries could obtain certain resources. Another example is India. British \ninfluence has caused several wars, leading to the formation of Pakistan and \nBangladesh. Pakistan and India have had some of the most heated border \nconflict since 1949. Not a single soul I have spoken to holds grudges \nagainst the Europeans. You people have to say America is \"bad\" because that \nseems to be the worldwide trend. I get that many of you criticize America \nbecause of its political interests, and that's fine. But criticizing \nAmerica because of crude and unthoughtful stereotypes is wrong. \"Americans \nare fat\", \"Americans are stupid\", \"Americans buy more than they need\". All \nof these are stereotypical statements. Every country has obese, \nunintelligent, and greedy people.

That means secession is simply a change in the Texas \nnational foreign policy with the other states by abrogating the \nconstitutional agreements with them. \nHappens every day.\n\n>>\"The Union was built on secession -- seceding from Great Britain.\"\nBy each colony BECOMING A SOVEREIGN NATION-- \n\n\n*His Brittanic Majesty acknowledges the said United States, viz., New \nHampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, \nConnecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North \nCarolina, South Carolina and Georgia, to be free sovereign and independent \nstates, that he treats with them as such, and for himself, his heirs, and \nsuccessors, relinquishes all claims to the government, propriety, and \nterritorial rights of the same and every part thereof.*\n\n\n\n\nlike Texas did in seceding from Mexico. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoining a union doesn't mean that sovereign nations lose their \nsovereignty-- it must be EXPRESS and INTENTIONAL, and the states fully \nintended to RETAIN their sovereignty. \nAs with the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union:\n*Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every \npower, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation \nexpressly delegated to the United States, in Congress assembled.* \"\nOr with the Constitution:\n\n\n*Each State, in ratifying the Constitution, is considered as a sovereign \nbody, independent of all others, and only to be bound by its own voluntary \nact. In this relation, then, the new Constitution will, if established, be \na FEDERAL, and not a NATIONAL constitution.* -Federalist 39\n\n\nSo it's not a question of retaining their legal right to secede, but simply \nretaining their SOVEREIGNTY as a separate nation, under which the right to \nsecede is absolute and sacrosanct.  \n\nThe USA is an international Union of sovereign nations, NOT a single \nsovereign nation of subordinate states. And that makes all the \ndifference. Specifically, Texas-- like each of the individual 13 original \nstates-- joined the Constitutional USA as an independent sovereign nation \nto itself. The Constitution NEVER formed a new state or nation, and never \nrelinquished the national sovereignty of any state TO such a new state or \nnation; on the contrary, each state remained a sovereign nation, ruled by \nits PEOPLE not its state government.-- and so, the People of each state \nsimply delegated certain powers to state and federal government, while the \nPeople remained the absolute supreme ruling sovereigns.In other words, each \nstate was like a corporation where the People were the stockholders, and \ngovernment was just the hired managers. Likewise, the Union was just a \nPARTNERSHIP of these corporations, i.e. there was no mutual ownership of \nany one corporation over another. So in the beginning there was a \npartnership of 13 corporations, each owned by various stockholders; the \nConstitution was simply the partnership organization and by-laws. So like \nany partnership, a state can leave the Union by vote among its People, just \nlike a corporation can leave a partnership by popular vote among its \nstockholders.END OF STORY.\n\n\n\n\nSo each state fully intended to become-- and REMAIN-- a sovereign nation \nunto itself.

Still, we're not accounting for \nthe thousands of Texan US soldiers that would be loyal to Texas, not the US \n(I'm not saying ALL Texan US soldiers, just the honorable ones) resulting \nin mutinies from within and strategic assassinations from the inside of the \nUnited States armed forces. Even still, we have the fact that our current \npresident (Obama) is too spineless to even send troops to fight TERRORISTS, \nlet alone people who actually SHOULD get what they're fighting for. Then we \nhave the people in the US that would ridicule any president who \nnon-collaterally killed thousands of innocent people with no previously \nhostile people in the area. All of these factors combined could, without \neven fighting, cause the US to be to scared to fight a war with Texas and \nits would-be allies, and if they DID decide to fight a war, all of these \nfactors could easily result in a Texan victory.\n\nThanks,\nA Future Citizen of the \nRepublic of Texas\n\nP.S.
