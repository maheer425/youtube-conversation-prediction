First an end to slavery, then women's rights, \nAfrican-American voting rights, interracial marriage, abortion and gay \nrights... Every time the more conservative side (basically God-fearing \n\"republicans\") tried to withhold rights from others. Just think of the \nabortion and gay rights movements now. The conservative CHRISTIANS are \ntrying to restrict what other people do, even when it had nothing to do \nwith them. And do not tell me it has nothing to do with religion.",
