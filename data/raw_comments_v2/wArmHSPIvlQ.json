First 3 were ten \ntimes better in my opinion, and the opinion of most other people i would \nsay, although they still had lots of action. The trailer for MOS didn't \nfeature any of the CGI heavy carnage and hinted at a film that would be \n'deep', which it wasn't. And for a film of this length, 20 \nminutes of character development isn't much really. Sure there has to be \nsome action and 'super' stuff, but this film went overboard and for my \ntaste became just noisy and boring. The CGI was good, but that's to be \nexpected given the budget... depends if you like CGI I guess. It's ok in \nsmall, effective doses but special effects shouldn't be the centrepiece of \na film.",

Loved the chemistry between parker/gwen, but \neverything else just wasn't thought out right.  \n\nI often wonder with so much great source material (comics, graphic novels, \nect), why is it so hard for these guys to get certain characters right in \nthe movies (punisher, spiderman, iron man solo films, ect) and tv. \n Netflix's daredevil was amazing.  But Marvel seems to know what they are \ndoing with all this.  Endless river of opportunity for marvel.

Superman is supposed to be optimistic, that's why he \nstands for all of the good things that we used to idolize (truth, justice, \netc.)\n\n2) character development. clark's desire to save people seems to come from \nnowhere, especially since the only father he knew in MoS his whole life \ntold him to \"maybe\" let people die and told him not to save him from the \ntornado.\n\n3) form. all of its problems aside, the Richard Donner Superman movies (I \nand his version of II) stick with people because, like Star Wars, they \nadhere to the old monomyth, the story of the epic hero conquering evil \nthrough great tribulations. Man of Steel has the \"hero\" becoming like the \nvillain in order to conquer him.\n\n4) image. Superman is always, ALWAYS, being likened to the God of the \nJudeo-Christian tradition. i remember back in late 2001 where one magazine \nactually ran an article that said \"where was Superman on 9/11?\" just as \neasily you could replace Superman with your choice of deity and the \narticle's message (human heroes > fictitious ones) would have been \nunchanged. in light of that, and the Jesus imagery in this film, what does \nMan of Steel deliver about the notion of deities, what with Superman having \nthe glowing red eyes when he uses heat vision, letting thousands of people \ndie in massive collateral damage, killing his first foe and telling the US \ngov't that, despite showing that he will kill if forced (and let people die \nin the process), they should just \"have faith\" in him? i don't know, seems \nto give the same impression that the Noah movie made (and don't bring up \nCyclops from the X-men: nobody likens Cyclops to God, not by any stretch of \nthe imagination). i know most people probably don't believe in any god, so \nthen why do we need to have yet ANOTHER film that is fixated on attacking \nthe idea of God? we have so many, one would think nonreligious people have \nan undying god-hate fetish\n\n5) the plot. why does Zod (who isn't the satan archetype of the Donner \nfilms, further pushing Man of Steel from the monomyth) choose earth above \nall other places to use his world engine, especially when there are other \nplanets possibly more suitable? so that there is a conflict, you say? fine, \ni'll buy that. but why does Superman choose to, once again, let people die \ninstead of telling them to go transform another planet? (in this case, \nunlike the collateral damage from before, it is willful. he says \"Krypton \nhad its chance\" before destroying Zod's ship. it is a willful act that can \neasily be compared to genocide)\n\n6) petty annoyances. Zod shouldn't have said \"i will find him\" four times \nin a row (even Terrence Stamp's campier moments weren't that silly). the \nreaction of the people of earth after being threatened by destruction by an \nalien/knowing that there are aliens was very weak and unrealistic. i love \nAmy Adams, but i can't stand what the director did: imo, the charm and \ncharisma that i've seen her portray in her other roles is just not here\n\ncondensed: the tone was off and everything that Superman used to be was \nerased in favor of once again attacking the notion of God (see nu-Clash of \nthe Titans, Legion, Noah, etc.)",

Yup, not his first time. Nearly every comic character has \nkilled someone, hell Batman used to carry a gun.

This is about Kal El learning his way to becoming the \ntraditional Superman character. If you want him to just become the Superman \nfrom the comics during the first 30 minutes go watch the Reeve version \n(which i also love as well as this movie). This movie was about developing \nKal El into Superman. There's a reason it's called Man of Steel, and not \nSuperman. ",
