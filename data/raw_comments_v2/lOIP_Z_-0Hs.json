You \nhave 1 bacterium in a petri dish...and after time is divides into 2..then \n4..and the AMOUNT of bacteria grow...but the RATE of the \nreproduction/growth doesn't change, just the amount of bacteria dividing. \nAs space expands, that creates MORE space...that space will also expand.... \nSo what I'm saying is that the RATE of space growth is not accelerating at \nall. Just the more space creates more space so with each growth the AMOUNT \nof space grow faster. Any thoughts?\ufeff",
