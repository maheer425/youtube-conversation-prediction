So I cut the meat samgyeopsal style but I oven \ncooked it for me and my brother and made a sauce made of strong soy sauce, \nsweet soy sauce, spicy vinegar and mild vinegar and added black ground \npepper. I call Kuya (older brother in Filipino) Onichan (what I always call \nhim because of me doing aegyo a lot recently while doing a cute voice). \nOnichan ate a lot of my meat without rice when I let him taste it 'cause he \nthought I already got my share! Silly Onichan! >_< The meat tastes delicous \nas well but it's not as tender and gummy! Probably because it was a little \nbit frozen when I cooked the meat. I'm eating this while watching you cook \nand eat samgyeopsal in this video. >_<\n\nI actually like chewing the cartilage as well because I'm a Filipino and I \nfind it yummy especially the pork cartilage and on the ends of the chicken \ndrumsticks. I like gummy and non-gummy meat. :)\ufeff",
