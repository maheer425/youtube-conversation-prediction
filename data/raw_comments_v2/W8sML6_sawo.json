I can honestly say, though our cruises were different in the \nentertainment, I feel the same way. It was nice to be away from the world \nbut with a community of people who shared the love of music I do and being \nable to casually chill out with my idols. Your ship put our ship to shame \nbut honestly I can totally relate to how your feeling, especially the part \nwhere you had to return home to the cold. Trust me I live in canada and \nreturning home to the cold was not fun. You know what else wasn't fun \nthough? Separating myself from that community. I met so many awesome people \non board that ship and it makes me sad that we have to just communicate \nwith each other via Facebook until we can once again reunite in another 300 \nand some days. \ufeff",
