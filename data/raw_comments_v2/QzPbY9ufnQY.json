            "text": "The first as i saw you i thought, that you were born with \nHutchinson-Gilford-Progeria-Syndrome. There are so many children an adult \nwith the HGPS in the world. Now i am only a medical student, but I wrote \nabout this Syndrome my work and you are looking exactly as the other person \nwith this disease. Every person with HGPS have exactly that same face as \nyou and the same body as you as they all  would be all twins.  But you say, \nthat you have another syndrome, it surprise me sooooooooo much. Are you \nsure about your diagnosis? Or is it possible to have the both diagnosis - a \ncombination of that diagnosis, that you know now with a diagnosis: HGPS?  \nOr maybe only HGPS as I recognise with my eyes? Only your hair are not the \nsame, because children with HGPS lose their hair with age. But your face is \nexactly as of  HGPS. You are not alone. And dont be troubled about your \nface. You are so beautiful person and Jesus can see it. After this life on \nearth everyone will see who really is beautiful and who not. Because after \n100 years, wenn we all will be death and we will dont have our body, we \nwill see that we all are angels just from light and love. And bad people, \nwho on earth had maybe beautiful face, after death they are dark and \nwithout light and without love. They are really not beautiful. And many \npeople as you, who on Earth have troubles with their body, but have \nbeautiful heart, they are so beautiful in heaven, because of so many light \nand love, they shine. In heaven has nobody body from earth, but a new body \nfrom light and love. So YOU ARE IN REALITY BEAUTIFUL, maybe more beautiful \nas most of people. And Jesus loves you so as you are. And he makes you so, \nbecause your disease and your life is very necessary for him and for the \nlove, because you have a very important task in your life - to give others \ncourage and help to people dont be sad about their problems and dont kill \nthemselves, because of their problems. You have to show, that everybody has \nto live and has to learn how to live and can be happy, just if the want \nand  if they learn how and they have to learn their task in their lifes, \nthat Jesus gave them in this life on earth, so as you did. You are so \nbeautiful. I see you with my heart. God loves you, your family loves you, I \nlove you as well and many many people, who knows you, love you also. And if \ni would be you, i would ask any other doctors, as that you asked before and \nask them if it could be possible, that you have HGPS. See in google faces \nof Hutchinson-Gilford-Progeria-Syndrome, that has so many children in the \nworld, not so many, but many, more as you think. If i would be you i would \ncontact the others HGPSs to feel not alone. They have often regularly \nmeetings, they (from whole world) come maybe once in year together and \nspend some days together and speak together. When they are toghether they \nsee, that, they are as the others. And they find many friends there on this \nmeetings. You are really not alone. And we all love you. You have also this \ntask from Jesus in your life: love everybody especially them, they dont \nlove you, pray for everybody-especially, for them, who dont love you, \nbecause, they are bad people and need your forgiveness and your love and \nyour pray more as the other people to be saved for heaven after this life \nafter 100 years on earth. I love you.\nWith love Angel (Angelika)\ufeff",
