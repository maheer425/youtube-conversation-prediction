What I meant was, you need talent to make money with \nsoccer/football. its not that if you practice every day you get to play at \nBarcelona or Real Madrid. But if you practice freestyle every day, you can \nstart giving shows and clinics and ask money for it. and this is all \npossible in like a year. You must either be a 12 year old kid, or an \nAmerican because you're pathetic with your arguements. ",
