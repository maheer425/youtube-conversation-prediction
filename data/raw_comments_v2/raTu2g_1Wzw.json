And, even \ntoday, just a few years after the advent, things are leveling nicely, \npeople learn to cope, adapt and benefit.\n\nSo, no, cameras on streets, people wearing Google Glass - actually a good \nthing. The result may be a LOT of creeps preying on good folk will have a \nreally hard time in the future, and maybe, maybe the days of the average IQ \nstreet thug are finally over.\n\nNot sure you checked, but highly intelligent criminals focus on the goal \nand do not indiscriminately affect people.  Yes, they are more cruel, but \nalso only affect those that bring them benefit.\n\nWith way more smarts needeed, the days of the street gangster bullying the \ngay or the other race member might just be seriously threatened.\n\nMy opinion is firmly this: 150 years later, the easy way to bring disbelief \non the face of an average citizen, will be to tell them there was a time \nwhen people were shy of cameras.

Secondly, these machines \nmake firearms that are a one-and-done type of deal. This technology is \nstill in it's extremely early stages and isn't gaining any real steam \nanywhere in the near future. At least not until they can figure out ways to \ndeal with the major crippling problems like insane expense, the absurd \namount of time it takes to make a part the size of a kitchen knife (nearly \nan entire day) and the level of noise and resources needed to make it work \nin the first place. It's doubtful it will even be a slightly credible issue \nat any time within the next 20 years. Thirdly, if someone really wanted to \nget guns illegally, there are MUCH easier ways of doing it than printing \nout a weapon that someone could trace to your personal computer and your 3D \nprinting unit. There's this thing called the black market that predates the \nwidespread use of any form of electronic communications, and it's much \nsimpler, much less expensive, and much more difficult to trace than these \nprinters are. It's hard to hide a 700lb+ machine after you've committed a \ncrime - not so difficult to simply throw a cheap gun you bought on the \nblack market into the nearest large body of water or find somewhere no one \nwill find it. I get why people are concerned, but at this point, we have \nnothing to fear from 3D printers.\ufeff",
