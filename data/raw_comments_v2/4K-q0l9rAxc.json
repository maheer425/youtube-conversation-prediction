I look \nover and my boy Chris is sitting next to me, smokin a joint like nothing is \nwrong. He says if we are going to jail, hes gonna get high first. so he \nholds the joint for me so I can drive. we ditch the car on the side of the \nroad, jumped a barb wire fence, and just ran for about 3 miles with the \ncops on our asses. we came back into town, jumped in one of the rain water \ndrain offs. you know, the ones that are like 30 ft tall? ran about 5 \nminutes into that and just sat there. turns out we were two blocks from my \nhouse so we went there, blazed up, passed out. Next morning we find out \nthat there was a drug bust on that house. apparently dude was cooking meth \nin the basement and somebody at the party called the po without saying \nanything. apparently he was a vet from the first Iraq war back in 1991. he \nhad a surplus of grenades, claymores, and rifles with ammo...... So from \nthat day on we only drink at my house with maybe 4 people.\ufeff",
