They aren't native to North or South \nAmerica, but in fact make their home in Africa and South Asia. For a \nmoment, let's just say you meant meant \"mountain lion\" instead, as they are \nthe only big cats that live around Virginia. Mountain lions are extremely \nendangered in the eastern and central U.S. so hunting them is illegal. \nSecondly, mountain lions usually avoid humans. If provoked, they with most \nlikely run off, unless you are too close to a female mountain lion's \ncubs. This fact disproves you even coming in contacts with such a cat, let \nalone it trying to \"eat you\".",
