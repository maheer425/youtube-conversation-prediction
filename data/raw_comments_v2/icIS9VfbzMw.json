The \nbook was absolutely amazing, and I had a feeling that Augustus didn't \nreally love Hazel but that he just wanted to get over Carolines death \n(which was never even mentioned in the movie) and live a life until he \n*spoiler* died *but by now I think everybody knows this* and Hazel was so \nblindly in love she didn't even see Augustus play with her feelings BUT in \nthe movie it was like an everyday Comedy/Drama/Romance, which has totally \nabolished my views. I don't have that much to say about Paper Towns but \nwhat if it will ruin my view at the book? Is it that safe to watch it? \nPlease, I would really want to know because right now I am not looking \nforward to the movie but I'm actually terrified of it's premiere.\ufeff",
