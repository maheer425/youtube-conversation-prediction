What causes the eruption is the bag of organic \nmatter breaking the crust on top of the volcano causing a vacuum effect, \nallowing the lava to burst out of the top.\n\nWhen the top is pierced, it acts like a vent giving the lava somewhere to \ngo, and because the pressure is so great under the surface, it just starts \nto shoot up, and has a snowball effect on the crust around it.\n\nWhat you're seeing in the video has nothing to do with the mass of whatever \nhe put in the bag evaporating on contact with the heat.
