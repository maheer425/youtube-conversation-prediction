We just got our seven year \nold to eat pizza from a place that isn't Papa AJ's, which has given me food \npoisoning one summer and also constantly gives my husband gut aches. We've \nbeen eating there for probably 3 years, at least, simply because our oldest \nson won't eat pizza anywhere else. Until last week!!! THIS IS A MASSIVE \nVICTORY!!!!!!1\nNow, if we can get him to eat actual meat, that would be fantastic. At \nleast he's into chocolate flavoured protein in his milk. If he didn't eat \nMcDonalds Cheeseburgers sometimes, he would be a vegetarian. He also would \nneed to eat more vegetables and fruit. As in ANY vegetables and fruit. \nOur four year old, on the other hand, is not only quite fond of bacon, but \nalso enjoys a bowl of sliced cucumber and balsamic vinegar. He also enjoys \nthe act of trying most foods, which is something our oldest is just \nstarting to not fiercely dislike. \n\nThe moral of this story is GOOD LUCK when it comes to kids and food. I had \nto go to Amish Land, outside of Chicago, and order a \"safe\" chicken burger \nthat turned out to be orange pulp in between two homemade buns, to decide \nthat trying foods that are out of my comfort zone isn't a bad thing. \nBecause if something as simple as a chicken burger can be ruined, when \nthere are chickens RUNNING OUTSIDE, something is wrong with the world and \nUp is now Down, Face is Foot and maybe that strange pasta dish isn't so \nbad. \ufeff",
