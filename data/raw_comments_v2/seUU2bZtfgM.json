You have x, you add a small \nchange (delta x), and then you calculate the gradient and then take the \nlimit. The proof for e is a little more complicated (though it depends how \nyou define e, if you think of it just as 'a number' then you'll need to \nprove it, if you think of it by its definition, a number such that its rate \nof change is equal to its change, then it's simpler). The point is though, \nthat when you add delta x, you're putting it into the exponent rather than \non to e, so the formula you're used to doesn't apply.

In this case it\u00b4s x, so f\u00b4(x) = df(x)/dx = \n6x\u00b2.But e^x has the variable x in the exponent, not the base! When you are \ndifferentiating any function type of g(x) = a*b^x with a and b being \nconstants, x is the variable. So you are differentiating the exponent is \nthis case, not the base, as it was in the first function f(x).If you \ndifferentiate any function type of g(x), the differentiation looks like \nthis:g\u00b4(x) = dg(x)/dx = a*b^x *ln b with ln being the logarithm of b to the \nbase e. So when you want to differentiate h(x)=e^x, you are differentiating \nthe exponent like this:h\u00b4(x) = dh(x)/dx = e^x * ln e , but ln e= 1, so \nh\u00b4(x) = e^x and thats why e^x is so special, because any differentiation \nwill result in e^x, it doesn\u00b4t matter how often you differentiate.You can \nsay : [d^n (e^x)]/d(x^n) = e^x for any natural n you choose.

            "text": "+Jonathan Mercure What you're talking about is different base systems. We \ncount 0-9 because that's base-10 aka denary or decimal. Computers use \nbase-2, which is binary. Just like with base-10, once you've reached the \nlimit in base-2, you go in to the next column, which is a multiple of 2. So \ncounting in base-2 looks like 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111 (and so on), \nwhere each column is a multiple of 2 (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s). 101 would be (4 x 1) \n+ (2 x 0) + (1 x 1), which is clearly 5. So 101 in binary is 5 in denary.\n\nThe example you made is not dissimilar to base-16, which is hexadecimal. \nEach \"column\" goes from 0 to F: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, \nE, F, which is 16 in length. And instead of going from 1s to 10s to 100s, \nor going from 1s to 2s to 4s to 8s like in binary, you go 1s to 16s to \n256s. For example, 3A in hex would be (3x16) + (10x1), aka 58. This isn't \nexplained very well but if you don't understand it you can find more \nonline, it's just called a counting system.\n\nAs for your proposition, maths would work in exactly the same way. \nComputers use binary because it has 2 values, 1 and 0, whereas denary has \n10. Since computers use electricity, they can assign 0 to be \"off\" (no \nvoltage) and 1 to be \"on\" (high voltage). There can't be anything in \nbetween, so you can't have more than 2 values.

Pi would not be equal 3.1415... in your \nbase 13 system (..9,k,h,f), but its purpose in the equations would still \nremain since its definition is independent from our counting system. That's \nwhy mathematics are universal.\nThe human construction of numbers consists of counting the sum of all \n1-digit numbers, 2-digit numbers..., n-digit numbers. That is, in base x, \nwe would represent a number as: a*x^0 + b*x^1 + c*x^2 + \u2026 + z*x^n, where \na,b,c\u2026 < x are the amount of one m-digit, respectively. This way you only \nneed the finite set of numbers a,b,c\u2026 < x to construct any number. For \nexample, 104 in base ten, says that we've got 1*10^2 + 0*10^1 (i.e. no, 2 \ndigit numbers) + 4*10^0.",

All of the roots of those polynomials are still considered to be \nalgebraic, because an algebraic number is defined to be a number which is \nthe root of a polynomial with integer (rational) coefficients.\n\nThe idea is that algebraic numbers satisfy some algebraic relation.\n\nLet's say you're looking at the field of rational numbers.  You can adjoin \na new complex number to this field, and see what relations it satisfies. \n For example, if \u03b1 = sqrt(2), then adjoining \u03b1 to the rational numbers, we \nhave that \u03b1 satisfies the algebraic relation \u03b1^2 - 2 = 0.\n\nThis makes Q(\u03b1) a finite-dimensional vector space over Q.  Thus, we can use \nlinear algebra techniques (and group theory) to study the structure of Q(\u03b1).\n\nFor a root \u03b2 of x^7 + 3x, we have the algebraic relation \u03b2^7 + 3\u03b2 = 0, so \nQ(\u03b2) is again a finite dimensional vector space over Q, which can be \nstudied using linear algebra and group theory.\n\nFor a number like \u03c0, though, it doesn't satisfy any nice algebraic \nrelations, so Q(\u03c0) is actually an infinite-dimensional vector space over Q. \n This makes it much more difficult to study, so we consider it a \ntranscendental number.\n\n(By the way, x^7 + 3x actually does happen to be solvable by radicals.  The \nroots are 0 and the 6 sixth roots of -3.)\n\nI guess the take away point is that we like algebraic numbers because when \nwe adjoin them to Q, they are relatively easy to study.

Maybe the only numbers that are the same \nspecies are themselves, just like only Homo Sapiens are the same species as \nHomo Sapiens. To imply that just because they are both whole numbers that \nthey must be the same species, implying that 7 is a cannibal, implies that \n7 and 9 simply falling under the same category indicates a species \nrelationship. IT is equivalent to the philosophical fallacy \"Monkey is not \nhuman. Tiger is not human, therefore monkey is a tiger\". Both monkey and \ntiger are in the same category, not human, but are not the same species. \nTherefore, just like monkey is not necessarily the same species as tiger \n(and in fact it isnt) just because of a categorical relationship, neither \nis 7 necessarily the same species as 9. Furthermore, the argument saying \nthat the category \"number\" indicates a species relationship could also \nimply that any category that two beings share implies a species \nrelationship. All plants and animals are living things. Therefore, any \nplant or animal that eats plants or animals is a cannibal. Thus everyone \nhere is a cannibal necessarily because I found a category that both you, \nall other animals (humans are in the animal classification of nature) if \nthe argument that 7 is a cannibal because he ate a number (9) is valid. \nThis is obviously wrong. You are not a cannibal for eating a watermelon \nunless you are a watermelon. Therefore, only one very specific \nclassification between 7 and 9 can indicate that 7 is a cannibal. Since a 9 \nis not a 7, just like a human is not a watermelon, 7 is not a cannibal.\n\n\n\nAlso, PI is in fact delicious. The area of a circle is A = PI*r^2 . \nTherefore all perfect circles contain PI. Furthermore, PIE is perfect and \nis a circle, and is delicious and contains PI in the area of PIE that you \neat. Therefore, PI is delicious, at least when contained within PIE.",
