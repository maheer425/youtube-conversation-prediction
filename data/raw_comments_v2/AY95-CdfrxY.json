I wouls say why you just said the other day \nyou love McDonalds. He says \"I'll never be caught eating their. when i eat \nfrom their i have someone else go pick up the food\". I'm like for real bro? \ni have 3 dollars i can't go anywhere else. weve been through this like 20 \ntimes. either he would ditch me or i would end up going with him and eating \nnothing. and one time. the worst time. he went ahead and paid for me. I \nalready felt low. and he made sure to let me know how he was their for me \nwhen he paid for my food every time we ever got in an argument. as stupid \nand as sad as it sounds. We were best friends for years. but as i got older \nand was forced to be more responsible not growing up with parents or money. \nand as he grew up getting more immature selfish and he wanted to do was \nparty we grew apart. and it all started because McDonalds has to be so damn \ncheap. he told me he would eat there if their McDoubles or dollar menu was \na 3 dollar menu....... It's amazing what people can eventually spite you \nover....Its not my fault i was poor. matter of fact i could go as far to \nsay a big reason i didn't have money when i was friends with him was \nbecause of him. I had a job and got him a job at the same place. I'll be \ndamned if he forgot to pick me up and i lost my job. and when he brought up \nhim paying for my food i brought up getting him his job he said \"wow your a \nself centered piece of shit I helped you in your time of need and i didnt \neven need the job so it doesn't count.\" in yet 3 years later he is still \nworking there....\ufeff",
