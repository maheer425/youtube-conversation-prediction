The \ncombination of atoms that cause the black colour might not be able to be as \neffective as the combination of atoms that cause the green colour.\nMaybe the temperatures get even too high when it is black which could \nreduce the efficiency and it may cause water to evaporate too fast.\nI think it has a green colour by accident.

When zanaphyll \ncaptures sunlight, it's purple. All plants have zanaphyll in them. (their \nback up life system that supports 30% of their energy intake) The zanaphyll \nresides just underneath the chlorophyll. So to recap: all plants are \npurple--they're just covered up by green \nchlorophyll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \nNow, in some plants, through evolution and breeding and mendelian tricks, \nwe've bred the chlorophyll to die, so its death naturally occurs at the end \nof a life cycle or through response to cold or any other external factors. \nBut in some seeds we've bred naturally, the chlorophyll just dies at the \nend anyway. Most plants can be purpled up by getting the right DIF (short \nfor differential), which is your day to night temperential temperature \ndifference.\n                                                                                                                  \n(nomenclature are very important when dealing with scientific names) In \ntruth Xanthophylls are not as quite as simple as that as really purple is \nmade by a mixture of other colors such as reds, yellows and such as much as \nwhat we are seeing is \"purple\" but that is the \"net\" effect\ufeff",
