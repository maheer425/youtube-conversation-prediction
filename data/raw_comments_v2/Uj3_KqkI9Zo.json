            "text": "This DOES NOT WORK because:\n\nGuests DO NOT move from room number n to room number n+1, the shuffling \nmust start at infinity, where a new room is opened up designated as room \nnumber \"infinity plus one\", and rooms get shuffled into the adjacent \nvacancies that get opened up along the way, BACKWARDS to room number 1.\n\nIn other words, the shuffling does not start at room number 1, it starts at \nthe end of capacity, then shuffling the previous rooms all the way back to \nroom number 2, and then the guests from room number 1 can vacate it for the \nhotel's new guests.\n\nYou ask, WHY DO ROOMS HAVE TO BE SHUFFLED FROM THE END, BACKWARDS,  RATHER \nTHAN FROM ROOM ONE, FORWARD (as this video states)?\n\nLet's try it, both ways, but with a FINITE SIZE hotel with 10 rooms:\n\nIn the BACKWARDS shuffle (that I am claiming MUST be used), it's really \neasy. First, the guests in room number 10 are moved forward into the corn \nfield, thus vacating it. Next, the guests in room number 9 are moved \nforward directly into room number 10, no waiting for anything else to \nhappen. The next STEP in the SEQUENCE is for the guests in room number 8 to \nmove into room number 9, etc, ONE STEP AT A TIME, all the way BACKWARDS to \nroom number 1, whose guests get moved into room number 2, leaving room \nnumber 1 vacant for the new guests who check in. Simple, right? ONE bellhop \ncan get it all done because it all happens in 11 steps, one room at a time.\n\nIn the FORWARD shuffle (used in all of the examples in this video), yes, \nthe guests in room number 1 do move into room number 2, and so the guests \nin room number 2 have to move, and so they move into room number 3, leaving \nroom number 2 vacant, allowing the (former room 1) guests who were WAITING \nOUT IN THE PARKING LOT for room number 2 to be vacated, to move. As this \nchain of events progresses FORWARD, the guests in room number 9 will \"push\" \nthe guests in room number 10 into the cornfield, and everyone can finally \nget some sleep, ESPECIALLY THE BELLHOP, who had to PERFORM 3 times the \nnumber of steps, as compared with the backwards shuffle method.\n\nHEY, no big problem, they just had to give him a bigger tip, right?\n\nOK, that was no big problem for ONE roomful of guest checking in, but what \nif 2 want to check in at the same time (leading up to the example of a \nbusloads of guests arriving)... hmmm, let's see... with 2 set of guests, we \nnow need to hold the guests of BOTH rooms 2 AND 3 out in the parking lot, \nRIGHT? And now, the poor bellhop needs to make 5 times the number of total \nsteps to accomplish the task.\n\nWith 3 new guests, this now means holding 3 room-fulls of guests out in the \nparking lot, and it now takes 7 times as many steps to accomplish vs the \nsimple BACKWARDS shuffle method.\n\nEtc... And not only that, the total count of bellhop steps DOUBLES for \nevery new room added to the capacity of \"finite hotel\" using forward \nshuffling, but only increases by 2 steps for each room number using \nbackwards shuffling.\n\nAs the numbers of new guests arriving increases, the amount of QUEUING in \nthe parking lot becomes proportional to the count of new guests, and the \ncount of steps it takes for the bellhop to accomplish the task increases \nexponentially.\n\nNow, did you envision this from the simple descriptions and visualizations? \nThis is supposed to be the \"infinity hotel of endless capacity\", yet the \nguests really have to all wait at the check-in and in the parking lot \nqueues for the rooms to actually become vacant. OBVIOUSLY, this ISN'T what \nit seems... the devil is in the details, and this is proven by actually \n\"programming\" a \"finite hotel\" and seeing what actually happens before \nmaking grandiose claims about what would happen in an impossible scenario.\n\nIf this were the infinity hotel, the guests would have to all wait forever \nin infinite size queues out in the parking lot, and the bellhop would have \nto perform and INFINITE number of steps just to get the first guest in, let \nalone an infinite number of busloads. What they're not telling you is that \nthe first step could never occur because it requires an infinite number of \nsequential steps to be completed before proceeding to the next room... this \nscenario is IMPOSSIBLE and thus this is all total bull shit!!\n\nOK, OK, then why doesn't the infinity hotel just use my simple backwards \nshuffling method? Why didn't they explain this stupid paradox that way? \nOnce again, smoke and mirrors... if they showed you this very simple \nmethod, they would have needed to start at the last room in the hotel \nfirst, and work backwards from there... hmmm, so the first thing is to find \ninfinity, which is impossible, so instead, they act as though they can \nstart at room number 1 and don't have to even mention infinity... and \ninstead, they try slipping it in by not addressing the actual physical \nsteps it takes to accomplish the task in the forward method shown.\n\nmarty\ufeff",
