After a while of confirming evidence, you're hypothesis will gett \nclassified as a theory. But the testing never ends.\n\n... That is a reasonable scientific progress.\n\nA nother example could bet:\n1. You have allready proved that the gravity drag apears to be with all \nmass. You have allso proved your theory of how gravity often forms orbital \nsystems and how they work, you call it celestial mechanics.\n2. You observe large galaxies which at first impression apears to spin like \nthe orbial systems in celestial mechanics.\n3. You postulate your hypothesis of how galaxies are gravitational systems. \nWith you celestial mechanics you calculate how much mass and and which way \nit should behave, for a galaxy to be a gravitational system.\n4. You start your asignment to observe if you'r hypothesis is right or \nwrong.\n5. What you find is that there is only a fraction of the mass needed, and \nthe orbital systems of the galaxies does not work with celestial mechanics.\n6. Because allmost all of the evidence goes agaisnt the predicitons of the \nhypothesis, the gravity and celestial mechanics did not manage to become a \ntheory. The hypothesis is proven wrong, un till further evidence could \nprove the different.\n\nNow there is this theory that gravity can bend light, which is realy a \nprediction which is hard to prove the direct link between gravity and the \nbending of light.\nIt would be a realy good evidence if lensing of light wasn't proven to be \nthe result of light shining trough plasmas and gasses.

It's just hard to observe \nsomething you can't see.\nWe have also detected neutrinos, which is a small, but noticeable portion \nof the estimate amount of dark matter. However there is still missing a lot.\nA way to prove or disprove dark matter could be to find or not find weakly \ninteracting massive particles (WIMP's). Tests are being made for these \nparticles.\nIt's not like we aren't trying to confirm it or disprove it.\nSo your statement \"Higgs and his team gave a way to dissprove their \nhypothesis, by not finding any particles with the size they where looking \nfor.

If we can't find matter, \nthere is no gravity acording to the model.\nIf it smells like a dead body but looks, tastes, behaves and feels like a \nmushroom, there is probebly not a dark dead body there, which doesn't \ninteract with reality, except from giving out the smell of a dead body.\nThe galaxy gravity model is the dead body and the mushroom is reality.\n\nEven the fact that the spinning pattern exists shows to how a galaxy is not \nformed by gravity. You have to postulate a toroid of matter around the \ngalaxy, which is nothing that any scientific model can explain or predict.\n\nI do not know the history of the higgs boson, but I find no concrete \nevidence for it. As how I know of it, it is a typical example of...\n1: My hypothesis says there is a ball around the wall.\n2: You look quicly and finds a ball shaped object.\n3: Asumes it will smell like orange, and opens up the champagne bottle \nbefore they even started to study the ball shaped object.\nBut realy, im not in to higgs boson that much.\n\nAs I understand it, it is not a adhoc, but a prediction from a theory based \non the standard model. You know, like how the matter which wasn't found was \nthe prediction of the galaxy gravity model.\n\nWhat would be comparable to dark matter would be: Lets say that the \nresearchers at cern didn't find any particle where Higgs and his buddies \npredicted them to be. And they would respond by saying \"But this can't be \nright, everything shows our theories to be right, There have to be a dark \ngod particle, which can't be observed in any of our tests\".\n... That would be similar to the dark matter senario.\nHiggs and his team gave a way to dissprove their hypothesis, by not finding \nany particles with the size they where looking for. The dark matter \nhypothesis does not.\n\nYou think it is cool to use a unscientific theory, just because there is \nnothing better. But it isn't. If scientists are at a dead end, it doesn't \nbecome cool to cheat your way trough the scientific method, otherwise it \nwould be useless.",

This observation doesn't \nfit with our calculations, so our initial assumptions most be wrong. From \nthese observations we now form the hypothesis of dark matter. We already \nknow that there are some matter that weakly interacts with the \nelectromagnetic force, some that don't interact at all. This is dark \nmatter, planets, neutrinos, black holes etc. The model for dark matter then \nsuggests that there may be more matter that doesn't interact with the \nelectromagnetic force.\nAs I already stated, it is possible that all our models are wrong, but we \nstill don't have a better one. We have the assumption that the laws of \nnature works the same way everywhere in the universe. If it doesn't, then \nwe can't know anything about the universe. If gravity works in one way for \nplanets in our solar system, but in another way closer to the center of our \ngalaxy, then we have to discard or at least make some serious chances to \nthe standard model.\n\nDark matter explains our observations.\nNext step is to test it and yes you are right if we can't find evidence we \nhave to move on to a better alternative.

The hypothesis that there is a \ntypr os elemental particle, which is dark matter and which we havn't found \nyet, is based on the dark matter hypothesis. It will not be a scientific \nhypothesis if dark matter isn't one to start with.\n\nYou can't test dark matter, because it is a hypothesis free from base in \nreality or even content. There might be alot of theorems about how dark \nmatter should interact with reality, but they are all just random \nunscientific ideas, because they are trying to explain a purely abstract \nconcept.\nEven if any of these theorems would apear to be true, they would not suport \nthe existence of dark matter, because there is no scientific base for how \nany of them should be linked to dark matter.\nIf testing any of the theorems would actualy mean to scientifically test \ndark matters existence, dissproving any of them would mean to dissprove \ndark matter. But there is no way to scientifically dissprove dark matter, \nso it can't be scientific. This is nothing to argue, this is what the \nscientific method says, Neither is this of a minor importance for the \nmethod, but the oposite. Science is all about the first observations, \nunderstanding and the testing of the understanding with more observations. \nTo only be able to prove something would render the testing useless, and \nthe whole scientific method would fall apart and become pointless.\n\nDark matter even misses one of the first observations. It understands the \nuniverse with gravity and a abstract idea. Science should never ever \ncontain any abstract ideas. Because science is a bridge built from \nobservation to observation. If you take away the land for a bridge to stand \non, the bridge will fall.\n\nDark matter is not a good explenation, because it doesn't explain anything \nin a scientific sence. All it does is to invent a world, where the gravity \nmodel works. But I could in a abstract way change and add things to the \nuniverse how much I want, it wouldn't still be scientific. I could invent a \nnew force, which works with all the observations. But what would be the \npoint of that, I wouldn't advance anything in science.

I am not a super religious person, in fact I \nlove science and Space, and I like the idea of believing in what is proven, \nhowever God is something you will have to believe in someday, not that god \nreligions show you but at least a creator... Hawkings said in one of his \nbooks that the space didn't need a creator because everything is created \nbecause of the law of physics but where were the laws made? Why are they \nthere? It doesn't matter where you look the questions of why? and who? will \nstill remain...
