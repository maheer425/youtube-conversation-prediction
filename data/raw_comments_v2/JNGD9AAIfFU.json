People confuse safe lane-splitting with idiots doing dangerous \nthings on motorcycles while lane-splitting--two different things. Most \nlane-splitters I see (I mean, greater than 50%) do stuff I wouldn't do. You \nwouldn't call a motorcyclist weaving through traffic a lane-splitter if \nthey took the full lane on every pass of a car, but such riders are simply \nrolling the dice each time they pass a car--and one day they're going to be \nat the wrong place at the exact wrong time and get taken out--this is no \ndifferent than people in cars who are speeding and weaving through \ntraffic--it's dangerous because drivers are not expecting to be suddenly \novertaken, and many people are not alert for rapidly approaching vehicles \nwhen they lane change. Safe lane-splitting is safe. Dangerous \nlane-splitting is dangerous. I see many lane-splitting motorcyclists who \nare clearly inexperienced and don't understand the difference.\ufeff",

I have ridden extensively in Europe and Australia and found \nContinental Drivers giving room for you to split lanes and in this video \nnoticed them giving room. I give room if I am in a car as I like to see \nmotorcycles ahead rather than in my rear vision mirror.\n\"... it is certainly NOT safer.\". That really depends on the situation. Do \nyou seriously expect motorcyclists to sit behind stopped cars and wait AND \nNOT use their advantage (given there is room) and make their way to the \nfront?\nThe worse situation (given that cars are stopped) that could happen is \nperhaps some damage to the car (mainly the rear vision mirror) or bike (if \na car driver tries to quickly change lanes they might find a motorcycle \nrider on their bonnet). However as I have said before, California allowed \nit after two motorcyclists were killed after being rear ended by a car \nwhile they were waiting behind stopped cars.\n\nCarefully assess the situation before doing it and I have only done it when \ncars are stopped and then haven't gone out of first gear.

Ya, they need to obey \nthe rules of the road, but you on your little risk rocket must make sure \nyou stay away from cars and maintain that \"safety cushion\".  You have the \nmost control over that.  Other cars aren't just going to spread out across \nthe road and provide that space for you.

You \nALWAYS need to have an escape route when riding a motorcycle.  Without this \ncushion your routes are limited.  It's all there in the DMV/Safety course \nhandbook.

I support \nit 100%.  In traffic there is no cushion.  You're all squished together. \n That's my point.  It would be dangerous to sit still, even though \nsplitting seems to violate that cushion rule.  In those cases it's \nextremely beneficial to the riders safety to split the lane.

People \nare constantly running red lights, turning right when they aren't supposed \nto, going in the wrong direction on roads, not using headlights, etc. You \nalso constantly have cars and trucks veering into scooter/motorcycle lanes \ndue to their bad driving/blatant disregard for the rules. Finally, the idea \nof safety gear is virtually non-existent. In Taiwan, a helmet is required, \nbut most wear cheap turtle hats instead of full face helmets and wearing \nanything else is usually scoffed at.\n\nDriving between cars at highway speeds is usually not allowed for lane \nsplitting, but if done safely it can also be the correct choice. If you're \nstuck behind a slow pack of vehicles and someone comes behind you in a \nhurry, there is no where else to go. We make it our job to understand and \npredict what cars are going to do. We learn how to read tires, lane \npositioning, and driving behavior to better understand what people are \nplanning. I personally don't lane split at these speeds, but I do believe \nit is acceptable when done correctly. That absolutely does not mean \nspeeding past everyone because you want to go 100+ or speeding past slow \nmoving traffic, but going an acceptable, responsible speed.",

Basically, you want to increase the \ndistance between you and all cars. Lane splitting violates that unwritten \nrule of riding. However, the rule has exceptions in my opinion. At slower \nspeeds, the safety cushion should be violated to prevent being hit from the \nrear by an unaware driver, but while lane splitting your scanning skills \nand awareness must be increased drastically for the maneuver to be \nconsidered safer than sitting the line of traffic.",

But another way to avoid getting rear ended without actually \nfully lane splitting is simply stopping in between the first pair of \nalready stopped cars going in your direction rather than actually \ncontinuing to travel all the way to the front. Or if its single lane road \ndoing the same thing but stopping on the line marking the shoulder next to \nthe stopped car. That way you are not directly in line with the car traffic \napproaching behind you making it much less likely that a car will rear end \nyou but rather it would rear end the car next you. Lane splitting at \nanything above 20 miles an hour in any sort of moving traffic is just plain \nfoolish. And stop and go traffic on a highway is even riskier since cars, \neven when they are only moving at 10 or 20 miles an hour are unpredictable \nsince drivers have a habit of switching between lanes when the other lane \nnext to them starts moving ahead. Watch the opening scenes of Office Space \nto see a funny take on just that scenario. Drivers are just in to much of a \nrush and distracted nowadays to trust that they are going to pay attention \nto potential lane splitting bikers. I'll take my chances waiting patiently \nin the lane with the cars although I will keep myself to the far right or \nleft of my lane to minimize the risk.\ufeff",
