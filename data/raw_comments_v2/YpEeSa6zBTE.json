Add on top of \nthat, that they will lie and twist the truth to blame the other person \n(their partner was abusive, stole from them, never did any work around the \nhouse, lied and manipulated them, ruining the other persons reputation and \nalienating him from friends and family) when in actuality it is just a \nprojection of what the narcissistic person has done to the partner, \nsometimes for years (as in my case) or decades!\n\nTheir partner is usually co-dependent, (as I am), meaning they are overly \nhonest, trusting and kind.  That is why I can't relate at all to what she \nis saying and why I am so offended by this presentation.  It is a pack of \nlies that makes her out to be some sort of hero, facing adversity and \novercoming her weaknesses, when it is nothing of the kind.\n\nThere is a great deal of psychological abuse that this type of person piles \nupon their victims.\n\nLying is only one aspect of what they do, so admitting you lie doesn't \nbegin to cover the extent of the ailment.  That is why I question her \nmotives.\n\nShe hasn't admitted how badly she has abused her partner, the other tactics \nshe uses (shaming, guilting, twisting the truth, omitting the truth, \nstealing), how she uses and discards people, her over inflated ego and \nsense of entitlement or the fact that they show no empathy for others, are \nvery materialistic and hasn't shown an ounce of shame, guilty or remorse.\n\nShe has made up a category \"psychology of self-deception\" instead of \ncalling it narcissistic or the proper names for what she does.  As a Dr of \npsychology she should have easily been able to name the conditions \ninvolved. (There are 10 psychological conditions, many of which relate to \nthis condition).\n\nThat is why I question her sincerity and suspect she is hiding the truth, \neven while she's pretending to tell the truth!\n\nThey are that twisted!\n-----\nThis presentation should never have been put on TED talks.\n\nIt seems to present a good message, (because most people don't understand \nthe context or the psychological ramifications), but the speaker is just \nstroking her own ego.",

Feminism is a movement and an ideology. Two different things, \nindeed connected to one another, but separate none-the-less.\n\n'To be clear, you're saying that there is nothing logical about a women \ngetting paid the same amount as a man, solely because she's a women. In \nfact, you take this a step further by saying that \"feminists have a flawed \nview of the world,\" with no facts or backup of any sort to support your \nclaim. I would love to hear how equality is considered \"flawed logic.\"'\n\nSo many straw men, so many red herrings. You want some evidence to backup \nmy claim - you're providing it just by responding.\n\n'I bet, if the demographics you fit into came experienced discrimination or \nlower pay, you'd start to care a whole lot, wouldn't you?'\n\nRed herring/ad hominem hybrid? Definitely trying to attack me personally \nfor no real reason at all besides having an opinion about a \nmovement/ideology.\n\n'It's this twisted mindset you have that led to the Halocaust, and \ncountless forms of oppression around the world.'\n\nI don't know what the Halocaust is, but it was an ideology of victimhood \nsimilar to modern Feminism that lead to the Holocaust. You see, German \npeople were suffering - as women have been for quite some time. The Nazis \ncame along and blamed the Jews, who were better off at the time than the \nGerman people, for the German peoples' suffering. In a similar way, \nFeminism blames men (or some metaphor for men such as 'Patriarchy') and \nthus they justify treating men like shit with 'well now you're getting a \ntaste of your own medicine' or 'you're just losing privileges, deal with \nit'... pretty much how the Nazis would have viewed their oppression of the \nJews as being justified.\n\n'You reject equality of others because - in comparison - you'd no longer be \n\"superior\"; and you need every and any form of mental reassurance so you \ncan find to avoid the fact that you're not better than anyone. The mental \ngymnastics you must have gone through to make yourself believe that you are \n\"better\" than others just because of the way you were born is appalling.'\n\nMore ad hominems, red herrings... just irrelevant fictional bullshit that \nyou're creating in order to set up the scene, to create a fictional enemy \nfor you to attack.\n\n...and with that I'm not even going to bother addressing the rest of your \ncomment because you clearly have nothing relevant to say at all.",

I honestly don't know why I'm \nwasting my time trying to help you; you'll do whatever it takes to convince \nyourself that you're right, even if it means changing the perception of \nyour own words.\n\nBy addressing the lies that you tell yourself to avoid change, you can \nbetter understand the causes and consequences of maintaing a specific \nbehavior. I don't know what you were smoking, or what you were watching, \nbut it clearly wasn't this video.\n\nI would recommend seeing a doctor of some sort; you must have something \nwrong with your head.
