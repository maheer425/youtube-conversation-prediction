Your chances of an accident are automatically lower based on \nthe shorter distance alone. I just disagree with anyone who says helmets \nare not worthwhile for any rider. If you buy a $20 Schwinn helmet from \nWalmart, its going to look ugly and be uncomfortable. A quality helmet is \ndesigned to be very comfortable because they are worn for long periods of \ntime. Cyclists would simply exchange them if they were not comfortable. I \nhave used my Giro helmet on 110 mile rides and I forget its there. Its very \nlightweight, well ventilated, and padded on the contact areas. The bright \ncolors increases my visibility in the day and the reflective paint \nincreases my visibility at night. It blocks the sun from my head and it \nabsorbs sweat from my brow. If you think bicycle helmets are a fuss, try \nwearing a full sized motorcycle helmet and enjoy the neck pain while your \nbody gets used to all that extra weight on your head.\n\nI also fail to see why people who have avoided serious head injuries with a \nhelmet should not be riding bicycles.

It's a completely different design for a completely different \npurpose. Bicycle helmets are designed to take less impact. It's only \nprotecting your brain area. In a car, you need a full helmet to protect \nyour entire head, particularly your face, eyes, nose, and mouth, since \nimpact comes head on, more than it does falling off a bicycle. You need a \nthick fiberglass shell and a lot of padding, thats to protect you in \ncollisions that occur at full speed. Airbags protect you at low speed \ncollisions. And how are you determining that helmets are failing to work \nwhen you have no idea how many people were wearing helmets in these \nfatalities? That information is often not reported. There have been 3 \ncyclists killed in my city this year. None of the reports stated if they \nhad a helmet or not. I will say that if you live in a very bicycle friendly \ncity like copenhagen, and in an area that has very good infrastructure with \nwell maintained roads, and you are only riding a few miles a week, then \nthere's a lot less incentive to wear a helmet. For cyclists like myself, \nwho go fast, go far, and ride in high traffic american cities, it's a no \nbrainer (no pun intended). I don't think you have ever been hit by a car on \nyour bike, or ever fallen off your bike at full speed and landed if your \nhead. If you did, your viewpoint might change. I didn't wear a helmet \neither until an 80 year old lady in a corvette coming out of a parking lot \nknocked me off my bike and crushed it like a monster truck.

That means, almost \nnothing involving cars, nothing at speed, nothing where you go over the \nhandlebars, nothing where you skid or slide... Quite apart from harm or \ngood, a helmet is much, much, much more likely to do nothing at all in most \nreal-life situations. \n\nThis doesn't really change whether you think they're a good idea or not... \nif you said helmets do slightly more good than harm, I'd probably agree \nwith you. What it does do, though, is make those 'unimportant' factors \n(like comfort, aesthetics, self-image) more important, if you see what I \nmean?\n\nAs an analogy...\nNo-one turns down an angioplasty operation because they don't like the idea \nof the scar. The benefits (and risks) are massive, and cosmetic \nconsiderations pale into insignificance. You could reasonable say to \nsomeone worried about this \"Have the angioplasty,` you're a fool if you \ndon't\"\nHowever, if the operation was to remove a benign mole then the benefits and \nrisks are much lower and cosmetic concerns are no longer immaterial in \ncomparison. Even if the risks outweighed the benefits (and you could \nconclusively show this) it would be difficult to say that someone was \nunreasonable, let alone foolish, if they refused to have it.\n\nFor me, helmet wearing falls in the second category. You can't merely say \n\"Helmets save lives!\". As I hope I've shown, that is, at best, an \noversimplification and, at worst, dangerously misleading. \n\nAll put together, what I think you're really getting, at the end of the \nday, is (at best) a minuscule reduction in an already tiny risk.

That does not invalidate the safety of a bicycle helmet, and \na bicycle helmet is a lot cheaper, more comfortable, and easier to remove \nthan a driving helmet anyways. Plus bicycles don't have airbags (yet). I \nthink you probably choose not to wear a helmet because you do not like how \nit looks, and you're citing these bizarre instances like being strangled by \nyour own helmet, to justify your decision. Let's remember that helmets are \nnot just for accidents involving cars. Unseen obstacles in your path, \ndamage to the pavement, and hardware failure are common things that can \nsend you over your handlebars at 20mph, and a lot faster if you're \ndescending a hill or mountain. My helmet's bright colors improves my \nvisibility during the day, and it's reflective paint improves visibility at \nnight. I have worn it on 100 mile rides and don't even notice it's there. \nBottom line is, the helmet is far more likely to save you from serious head \ninjury than it is to hurt you. But it's your brain. If you think you'll \nfind yourself regretting wearing a helmet, then you can learn from your own \nmistake. I was fortunate enough to already know better when a trash bag \nflew into my spokes, seized my front wheel, and sent me into the curb head \nfirst. ",

            "text": "+Chris Nelvin I didn't intend it as an analogy. I was merely trying to pick \napart your second statement, which isn't as absolute as people may think. \nIf it were true, and there are no scenarios where you'd regret wearing a \nhelmet, why limit it to riding a bike? You're right, hardly anyone dies \nfalling out of bed, but it's still a couple of hundred people a year. You \ncould say to those people \"wear a helmet, you wont regret it, and it may \nsave your life\" with complete honesty. Plus, as is pointed out in the \nvideo, wearing helmets as a car passenger would save thousands more lives. \nIf people were genuinely concerned about saving lives and preventing \ninjuries, you'd imagine that's where they'd start.\n\nThe point about strangulation was to point out that this isn't true. \nHelmets aren't universally beneficial (although they certainly are in some \nsituations) and do have their own risks. There /are/ situations where you \nmay regret wearing a helmet.\n\nSince there certainly are situations where a helmet can actually contribute \nto an accident or injury (as well as times where it can mitigate or prevent \nit), it almost doesn't matter (for the purpose of my point) how often each \none happens, just that both can.\n\n\"Wearing helmets when cycling\" is not like \"giving up smoking\", which has \nmany positive impacts and no negative impacts. \"Wearing helmets when \ncycling\" is much more like \"taking statins to reduce your cholesterol\", \nthere are positives and negatives and, just like almost everything else in \nmodern life, whether you do or don't is about balancing the risks and \nrewards. It's not as simple as saying \"Wear a helmet, it's all good and \nnever bad\", and people need to assess this balance themselves after, \nhopefully, looking at all the evidence. The balance of evidence is not \nstrong enough to be able to say 'You're a fool if you don't wear a helmet\" \nand certainly not strong enough to pass laws on the matter.\n\nSo... yeah.

Its not very compelling. In controlled conditions, \nbicycle helmets are dropped onto an anvil to simulate an impact of 20kmph, \nbut this doesn't simulate real world conditions very much and the tested \nimpact speed is lower than that in which a helmet would be very useful, as \nyou indicated in your truck analogy. Unlike motorbike helmets, from an \nindustrial design perspective, bicycle helmets are highly constrained by \nneeds of lightness and ventilation, so they are not as effective as \ncommonly believed. There are many studies which purport to show helmets are \neffective in the real world, often compiled from hospital admissions data, \nbut these studies are not verifiable because they are not scientifically \ncontrolled - they don't account for many social factors such as the risk \nprofile of the rider, nor physical factors such as the type of impact or \neven whether the riders would have been better without a helmet (which is \npossible because helmets can actually induce injuries such as rotational \nconcussion or strap strangulation). The only way you can make sense of such \nstudies is to try and assess how helmets impact society at the macro level \ni.e are bicycle riders, on the whole, better or worse off after wearing \nhelmets? This is where helmets really fail, because the majority of data \ncomes up negative. This is especially true when looking at data from \ncountries like Australia and New Zealand which have implemented mandatory \nhelmet laws, but have some of the highest collision and injury rates in the \nworld, and again true in comparison to the Netherlands, where no one wears \na helmet, but have the lowest injury and collision rates. Legal factors and \ninfrastructure, among other factors, affect this data, but these are \ninterrelated e.g the Netherlands builds infrastructure for bicycles because \nso many people ride bicycles, because their population correctly perceives \ntheir utility and safety, but Australia builds much less infrastructure \nbecause, despite the better climate for riding, far fewer people ride \nbecause they perceive cycling to be dangerous and inconvenient. That's a \nresult of their helmet laws. TLDR: Helmets are not as effective as commonly \nbelieved and at the social level they are mostly ineffective. ",

I'm not going to try and \nconvince people not to wear a helmet, but the truth is, bike helmets are \nnot as effective as they're claimed to be. As a kid, I wiped out countless \ntimes. I never wore a helmet, but I never hit my head on the ground either. \nBasic human reflexes help prevent head injury. People should learn how to \nfall properly, when to let go of the bike, and when to use the bike as sort \nof a shield.\n\nIn 28 years of cycling, I have covered tens of thousands of road miles, \nfrom rural to urban, including several bike tours and commuting on snowy \nand icy roads. Making yourself visible to motorists is critical to safety. \nOn rural roads, LED tail lights, a mirror, and bright clothing make for a \nsafer ride than just a helmet. Riding defensively and predictably, \nfollowing traffic laws, using proper hand signals, and making eye contact \nwith other motorists are all good habits to develop. Avoid riding on roads \nwithout a large shoulder, but if one must, then wear a high visibility \njacket. Pay attention to the road. Expect the unexpected. That's how \ncyclists stay alive. My current commuter bike has a 1200 lumen LED \nheadlight, two strobe type tail lights, a reflective triangle on my rear \nbasket, mirrors, and lights on the ends of my handlebars. I always wear \nlime green or bright orange clothing with reflective lettering, a lime \ngreen cycling cap, and shorts with reflective strips. At night or on rural \nroads I wear a high visibility jacket. It seems excessive, but it's \neffective. The goal is to make yourself visible to motorists. Over the \nyears, cycling in the US has improved dramatically, thanks to share the \nroad campaigns, revised driver education requirements that now cover \nbicycles, and LED lighting. Even if you don't have all that fancy lighting \nor clothing, your common sense, eyes, and ears will do more to protect you \nthan a helmet.\n\nBike helmet laws don't make sense. Each person should have their own choice \nabout their personal well-being. Mandatory helmet laws will serve as a \nbarrier to cycling. Some people get careless when they wear a helmet. \nConstruction zone helmet requirements do make sense, as there's a very real \nrisk of head injury. On a bike, not so much.",

He does however \nreflect most my opinions in terms of best approach to cycle safety, & I \nthought it was worth sharing.\n(B)  It seems I did not say the 'wrong thing' to 'the right person'. I \nasked if you could provide a paper that demonstrates the *net* protective \neffects of cycle helmets, and yet you provided a list of mostly irrelevant \narticles:\n\n#3 and #4, #10 do not demonstrate any protective effects. They discuss \nstrategies for the promotion of helmets.\n\n#1 #2, #6, #9 and  #11 attempt to demonstrate protective effects, but only *given \nthe occurrence* of an accident. I don't think many people dispute the fact \nthat helmets  offer at least some protective benefit, but what is the \nrelevance of this in terms of safety strategy if, e.g., they increase the \nprobability of an accident occurring in the first place? To quote cycle \nhelmets.org: \"The reason for studying helmet efficacy is to predict changes \nin injury rates when a population of cyclists all start to wear helmets.  \nHelmets can only be considered effective if the increased helmet wearing \nactually reduces injuries\"....\n\nMoving on to the  papers that I did ask about ..i.e. the ones that do \nattempt to demonstrate net protective effects.. (which can include case \ncontrol studies and  'helmet law studies').\n \n#3 This was written in 2001. It is quite well known that it is  out of \ndate  and there have since been several published criticisms of the \nanalysis techniques used in this paper.   e.g.  see - \"Publication bias and \ntime-trend bias in meta-analysis of bicycle helmet efficacy: A re-analysis \nof Attewell, Glase and McFadden, 2001\", Rune Elvik, 2011.  The reanalyzed \ndata shows there to be no net protective effects of helmets.  [ Maybe If \nyou spent more than 30 seconds on your literature review you would have \nalso found this  ;-) ]\n\n#7 - Reading  the paper, I see that in fact, for anyone over 15 years old, \nthey report an increase in injury rates ! But interesting for the <15's. \nI'll read more thoroughly -\n...which leaves  only one\n\n#8 This is the most widely cited paper in favour of helmets ...although it \nis a case control  study and such studies have a number of limitations... \n(e.g. that  randomised controlled trial design studies do not) and it is \nbased on very old data.  There are many criticisms of the Review  as it \ndoes not comply with the criterion  that it should use randomised \ncontrolled trials and it fails  does not present all relevant evidence... \nsee http://www.cycle-helmets.com/curnow.pdf\n'Helmet law studies' are better as they exclude a bias related to the type \nof person that chooses to wear a helmet. Studies in countries where laws \nhave been introduced (e.g. Australia) have not shown any net protective \neffects.  Given these, I hardly think a less respected and widely  \ncriticized case control study is   justification alone for promoting \nhelmets as a safety measure...\n ",

There \nis a mandatory helmet law for all ages in my city and three years ago \nbefore this helmet law the trails in my city were teaming with cyclists, \nNow you could fire a cannon ball down those trails on a beautiful Saturday \nand you would not hit a single cyclist. Everybody has put their bikes away. \nThat means thousands and thousands of people will suffer long term health \nailments associated with anther crippling law enforced by the government \ndesigned to keep us inside our houses, not to mention the social benefits \nof families out riding together, or kids meeting each other on their \nbikes.Also, long term health care costs in the billions of dollars and on \nand on. A chunk of plastic also does next to nothing to protect you, The \nvast majority of head injuries is due to rapid head accelaration which no \nhelmet can do anything about. Also, the evidence is very clear about \nmandatory helmet laws. They do cause more injuries and deaths to riders. \nYou are ignorant,",
