You can \nbelieve what you will, but we're here for facts, believe it or not this is \nfactual. Nothing about this video criticizes god or anything, it's about \nwhat we know, and from this forms the question of how we know it; basically \nto say he'll explain in later videos. This whole \"Debate\" on evolution is \nquite chaotic if you ask me, because there's really no debating it, it has \nmore evidence than necessary to be a fact. This guy is basically explaining \nit all to us, and you all disregard it with answers of chance and god, when \nreally we know most of what had happened. Surely, there are things that we \ndon't know, but we won't sit back and relax saying \"Well, god did it\". \nThat's not how science works, it studies, evaluates, and explains what IS. \nSo as for your religious beliefs, you may keep them, just keep them to \nyourself, because we've examined our minds and understand so far that \nthere's nothing that can't be explained while disregarding creation. If you \ndon't already know, science began as the observation of what god had \ncreated, later, those early scientists began to disregard a creator because \nof it, and this doesn't just include evolution or the big bang, it includes \nall of science, and even then science doesn't prove or disprove a creator, \ncreation is unfalsifiable, can't be proven nor disproven, and that's why it \nis left out of scientific studies, and after all of that, people still \naccept science and believe in a creator, scientists who study evolution \nhave religious people within their studies, and same with many other \nbranches of science.

An automatic consequence of that is that its \nmath works out.\nAs for Einstein, he did not believe in a god as described in the bible or \nany other religion. He believed there MIGHT be a creator (he was an \nagnost), but not one that interferes with life.\nBut then again you have to remember that einstein was far from perfect.

They believe this amount of time is necessary for all \nthe life forms on earth to evolve.\n\n\nOne of the best ways to show that the earth is not \"billions of years old\" \nis to look at the sun.\n\nWe are all aware that the sun is burning. What you may not have thought of \nthough, is that it can not burn forever. Though the sun does oscillate, it \nis also rapidly decreasing in size and mass.\n\nFor the last 300 years Boyal Observatory in England. They have carefully \nrecorded the rate the sun is shrinking. They have determined that the sun \nis shrinking at a rate of 5 feet per hour. At this rate, the sun would have \nbeen twice its present radius only one million years ago. The farther you \ngo back in time, the larger the sun would have been.\n\n\"The shrinkage rate centuries ago would be determined by the balance of the \nsolar forces. Since the potential energy of a homogeneous spherical sun \nvaries inversely with the solar radius, the rate of shrinkage would have \nbeen greater in the past than it is now.\"\nThis means that today\u2019s rate of shrinkage (5 feet per hour) was faster \nyears ago. Perhaps at the rate of 10 or 20 feet per hour.\n\nThe sun would have been big enough to touch the earth only 20 million years \nago. Evolutionists claim the earth is 4 BILLION years old. You can see why \nthis is Impossible.\n\nIf the earth was Billions of years old, then the earth would have been \ndestroyed by the sun.\n\nThe Evolutionists idea that dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago is absurd. \nThis is far too long ago for the sun to have allowed life on earth.\n\nThe earth can not be millions of years old.\n\ufeff",

As we know people say the devil \ntries to trick and deceive, it would make sense for the devil (in this \ncase, 'God'), to trick millions into believing the wrong things by \nrewriting the Holy Text slowly over the course of thousands of years, \ngradually, until the entire 'truth' of the matter was completely flipped \naround so the benevolent Satan was seen as a brutal demon while the \ntrickster God was seen as the path to heaven?\n\nYou said \"It doesn't matter if it was re-written\", but this is an example \nwhere I would assume it being re-written means quite a bit. It would mean \nthe entire faith is currently based on lies, deceit and manipulated texts \nfrom centuries ago, which drastically changes the context and meaning of \nthose texts.\n\nNow, if you're saying the current message of the Bible (to be good to each \nother, don't be a dick, etc) is what remains constant, that's true, but \nthat's the underlying morals of the book. The morals of the Bible don't \nequate to the stories about creation being true.
