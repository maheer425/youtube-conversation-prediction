He probably didn\u2019t think well maybe I should \n set up a better education system instead.. Like the rest of us he\u2019s doing \nhis best to muddle through life and we all have bad and good qualities (we \nare all bat people ).\n\nI think we definitely identify with him as with anyone because we see \ntraits of him (anger and frustration as mentioned by Hank).\n\nBasically overall \u2026.
