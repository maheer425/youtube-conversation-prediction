La mayoria (si no son todos) de \ndirigentes guerrilleros, paramilitares, narcotraficantes, etc; no son m\u00e1s \nque criminales al servicio de su empresa ilegal. Sin embargo, la mayoria d \ncombatientes rasos, de a pie, no son mas que personas que cayeron en este \ntipo de organizaciones por la ineficiencia del Estado y del Gobierno para \ndarles las condiciones minimas de una vida digna. Si esto no fuera asi, \ncrimenes como el reclutamiento ilegal no harian parte del amplio prontuario \nde muchos criminales.
