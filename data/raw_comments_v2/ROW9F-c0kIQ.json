This means a lot and we should all take this into account. We use far \nto much plastic and it needs to stop before it gets out of control.\n\nAs we saw in the talk, we produce 300 million tons of plastic a year and \nthis is a phenomenal amount especially if we consider that if we keep going \nat this rate we will have no life left in the oceans. This is why I am in \nfull support of this talk. We need fish, we need animals that eat these \nfish, we need the animals who eat those fish because, at the top of the \nfood chain we have us. Fish is one of the main parts of our diets but with \nall of this plastic in the oceans, there will be no fish left. This is why \nwe need this idea and we need to execute it now. \n\nAs we found out in the video, plastic is something that we use everyday, \nwether it be from a lunch bag, a plastic drinking bottle or even the \nwrapper of our favourite chocolate bar, plastic is everywhere! Everyone in \nsociety has dropped at least one piece of rubbish at some point in their \nlives, this could be old, middle aged people or us, the main problem - \nteenagers. \n\nWe saw in the Ted Talk that plastic will always find a way into a stream, \nthese streams then feed into a river, these into the rivers estuaries which \nopen out to sea. 71 percent of the world is covered by water, the oceans \ntake up a whopping 96.5 percent of this water and it is all polluted in \nsome shape or form. And it\u2019s easy to stop it at the source but as we have \nfound out, nobody seems to care, they just say \u201coh it\u2019s the next \ngenerations problem\u201d and it really will be if we are stupid enough not to \nmake a start now. \n\nThe oceans have 5 main gyres that keep the water spinning all over the \nworld. These gyres in fact are the main problem. Because all of the rubbish \nis in the sea it means that it has to pass through one of these gyres and \nas we have found in the talk this is a big problem. The rubbish forms into \nmassive patches in the middle of the ocean and if a fish or any other sea \ncreatures were to swim into one of the rubbish patches they would be \npoisoned and would probably die from it.\n\nWe need to embrace this solution and accept that we as human beings were \nthe ones who started this so for the sake of the animals and us. If we \ndon't fix this global problem right now it will never be fixed. If we don't \nstart cleaning up the oceans they will become overpopulated with rubbish \npatches not algae. Next time you throw a plastic bottle in the stream just \nremember that small bit of rubbish in that stream from a plastic bottle can \nhelp contribute to a far bigger problem. This is a problem that can be \nfixed, by our generation and as we heard from Boyan Slat this is a \nprofitable option to take so why not give it a try? \ufeff",
