This is native American \nland to this day and everybody including the Mexican mestizos that are \nangry that need to go back to there old heritage to there old native ways, \nlanguages and cultural practices and be peaceful about it rather than say \nthey are going to take us over and drag there criminal law enforcement and \nproblems they inherited from being overrun and victimized as well \nby colonial terrorism and modern day greed.   QUIT BEING BLIND. ISRAEL \nFIGHTS TO THIS DAY.... WE WILL GET OUR COUNTRY BACK ALSO JUST LIKE THEM... \nYOU CAN START GIVING IT BACK TO US NOW BY ASKING THE EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS \nOR WHEREVER IT IS YOU CAME FROM TO ASSIST YOU SINCE THEY ARE THE FAULT AND \nTHE BLAME.  TO THIS DAY DISPLACEMENT OF PEOPLE GOES ON TO THIS DAY. THEY DO \nIT WITH WAR. THEY DO IT FOR CORPORATE GREED NOW TOO.   I AM ASKING YOU AS A \nTRIBAL USA NATIVE MEMBER TO TO DO IT IN A PEACEFUL WAY AND FINALLY SEE THE \nTRUTH AND JUST LEAVE. \"YOU THE PEOPLE\" KNOW WHERE YOU ARE FROM.... Remember \nyour people slaughtered our people and broke our hearts and we have to \nwatch it everyday right in front of us.\ufeff",

I'm very glad not to be \nrelated to you.  Let me explain racism from the point of view of the \ndifferent races in America for you:\n\n(i) If you're a white person (62% of pop.) racist against non-whites, you \nhate 38% of Americans.  Stupid.\n(ii) If you're an African American (13% of pop.) racist against non-afro \namericans, you hate 87% of Americans.  Very stupid.\n(iii) If you're Native American (1% of pop.), and racist against everyone \nnot a native American, *you hate 99% of Americans*.  MORONIC.\n\nI guess some people are so bitter and twisted, they just want to see the \nworld burn.  Well, go ahead and try; it's obvious you are too weak and \ncowardly to do it yourself, and people are too clever to fall for this \nrace-baiting shit.

However, it doesn't have any bearing on the illegal \nimmigration debate.  There was no immigration law back then.  There was no \ncountry.  There was never a unified country of Indians.  There was this \nmass of land known as North America which was full of tribes of various \nsizes who occupied different patches of land, many of whom were nomadic, \nmany of whom warred with each other.  Indians say, \"You cannot own the \nland,\" but then they turn around and claim that white people stole it from \nthem.  Which is it?  If you can't own the land, then it can't be stolen \nfrom you.\n\nSeriously, though, what happened to the Indians was wrong, but that's how \nmigration and nation building has been done since the beginning of time.  \nTwo people want one plot of land... they fight over it, to the victor the \nspoils.  The Indians migrated here from Asia... guess what?  They killed \nthe people who were here before them, the descendents of African emigrants \nwho resembled Australia's aboriginals.  That's just the way it is.  We have \nborders.  We have a governmental system.  We have to have immigration \nlaws.  Imagine if tomorrow everyone said, hey let's move to America, and \nthen you had 8 billion people all trying to fit into New York city... it \nwouldn't work out to well.  We need to be able to defend our borders and \nallow people into the country in a balanced, orderly way that's as fair to \nas many people as possible.\ufeff",
