There is a pagan holiday called Imbolc (candlemass) that \nfalls on feb. 2nd that has an old story that goes with it about an elderly \nwoman who would leave her house to gather more lumber for winter on that \nday. she would only leave to get the wood if it was pleasant and sunny and \nnot dreary and cloudy, (hence the seeing shadows thing because shadows wont \ncast on cloudy days). this is just research i stumbled across on my own and \ni noticed the connection.  i'm not sure if this is where groundhog's day \ncame from but it's a pretty neat coincidence.  a lot of modern holidays \nseem to have pagan influence, like Halloween (Samhien Nov 1st) and \nChristmas (Yule Dec 22) .... suddenly \"yuletide\" makes sense haha\ufeff",
