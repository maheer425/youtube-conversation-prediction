            "text": "All right, kids. I've read enough derogatory bullshit.\n\nWhat's up with you people? If you think TDK is so monumentally superior, *why \neven watch a clip like this*?\n\nWhy bother going down to the comments to take some wimpy, \npassive-aggressive dig at Nicholson or the film itself?\n\n*\"Yeah, Jack was OK. But Heath played a realistic psychopath...\"* setting \naside the complete inaccuracy of those kinds of remarks... What pent-up \nfrustrations do you hope to relieve by writing this stuff?\n\nI've grown to like *the Dark Knight* quite a bit, actually. Whenever it \ncomes on the tube, I watch. But I still view it in realistic terms rather \nthan mythic ones, & Christ - *B'89* creams it any any day of the week.\n\nAllow me to expound, as you folks have made me feel compelled to do.\n\n*B'89:*\n\nLoose, naturalistic performances; a lean, mean script; straight-forward, \nuncluttered storytelling; perfect atmosphere (a deft combination of levity \n& gloom); a superior score; a mysterious, tormented & emotionally remote \nBruce Wayne; a spontaneous Joker with a dark sense of humor & a propensity \nto *cause* chaos rather than recite speeches on the subject; an engaging & \ncompelling character dynamic between the two (*\"I made you?! You made me \nfirst.\"* As a long-time comic devotee, I don't give the slightest of fucks \nabout Joe Chill & never will - the most pointless, unremarkable, *\"we need \na guy with a gun for this scene\"* character in comic history); & absolutely \ngorgeous production design. The female lead has an identifiable motivation \nsomewhat central to the plot... & she's beautiful (& a decent actress) to \nboot. Yes, she unfortunately winds up a 'damsel in distress' - that was \ninevitable in an early comic-superhero film - but hey, at least she brings \non an intense, operatic finale.\n\nConversely, *TDK:*\n\nThe acting, for the most part, is stiff & weirdly stagey (apart from \nFreeman & Caine, who were outstanding); 3/4 of the *nearly 3-hour runtime* \nis recitation of repetitious, expository monologues (which seem to emulate \nthe mindless pontification of David Goyer's); the thread-bare story is \nconvoluted with a new plothole (or convenience) every few minutes; Bale's \nBruce is a narcissistic, tantrum-prone & completely uninteresting wimp; \nHeath's Joker is a one-dimensional cartoon (a growling, violent one, yes; \nbut a caricature nonetheless) who pops up out of nowhere with 10 or 15 of \nthose wonderful Nolan Bros. monologues in his pocket; there's no element of \nmystery to him despite his lack of backstory (or for that matter, character \ndevelopment); he spends more time *talking* about \"causing chaos\" than he \ndoes *actually causing chaos*; the theme music (*\"Ooh! I know! Less is \nmore! We'll just lace the same few cello-heavy lines with tribal drums & \npeople will call it intense!\"*) is not only as mindless & repetitious as \nthe screenplay, but is surprisingly derivative of Elfman's *'Descent Into \nMystery'* from *B'89*. The female lead - imbued with a thoroughly \nartificial (& borderline offensive) air of girl-power (first awkwardly \nshoehorned in by Goyer in *Begins*), is not only a pointless, grating, & \nunnecessary character, but by the end of *both* *Begins* & *TDK*, she - for \nall her assertive, brassy dialogue - winds up the same old 'damsel in \ndistress' character we hoped we'd get a break from.\n\nAs someone with a fair depth of understanding of acting & screenwriting, \nI'm still completely lost as to how *anyone* can praise *The Dark Knight* \nas some sort of masterclass when it comes to either.\n\nI probably shouldn't even mention the *visible cameraman* in the \ninterrogation scene, the proliferation of horrid one liners that sound like \nleftovers from an unused Schumacher script, or Oldman's Gordon *shouting in \na British accent*.\n\nYes, there should've been more focus on Bruce/Bats (& less on Joker) in \n*B'89*; Harvey Dent should've gotten some actual screentime, & Pat Hingle \nas Gordon was *horribly* miscast (& gave one of the worst performances in \nany Batman film), but it's better than making a \"Batman\" movie that plays \nlike drawn out, thoughtlessly produced episode of *CSI*. So either enjoy \nthis clip, or go watch something else.\n\nBats, cheers, & many more years.\ufeff",

            "text": "+Rooster Montgomery ha as long as you credit me, i'd be flattered. \nAlthough... I really don't even like to write stuff this negative anymore; \nI try to avoid it, & there are quite a few things about *Begins* & *TDK* \nwhich I *do* enjoy.\n\nBut I'm so often pushed. And overall? \n\nThey're starchy, stagey, full of bad acting (which is not to say *all the \nacting is bad*), not very well-written, & dour & self-serious to the point \nof cartoonishness - and as long as people insist on comparing them with \n*B'89*, I won't shy away from pointing that stuff out. \n\nBut apart from that, it's like the slagging of *B'89* is almost mechanized \nnow. People just come out with the same few digs like robots, and generally \nthey're not even legitimate flaws; it's just stuff that didn't appeal to \ntheir sensibilities, or things they invent to complain about because they \nhave this mysterious resentment for the movie. You could flip that around \nand say it about my digs at Nolan's films, of course - but you'd pretty \nmuch be inarguably wrong. \n\nAside from the fact that only I really slag them when heavily provoked, \nmost all that I complained about - monologues every few minutes that drag \non forever, expository dialogue from otherwise-pointless supporting \ncharacters who happen to pop up every scene, ham acting, plotholes aplenty \n- never mind the hamfisted socio-politcal stuff (subtext & underlying \nthemes tend to lose their subtlety & punch when they're clumsily written \ninto every character's monologues) or the rather lazy, *poor-mans \nexpressionist* cinematography (*\"Batman's a brooding character who comes \nout at night, right? Let's just turn the lights way down for 3/4 of the \nmovie & drain 3/4 of the color in post\"*) - all this stuff that I mention - \nthough my list is rather extensive & bitchy - really isn't even \nnitpicking... it's pretty much filmmaking 101. Considering that the *DK* \ntrilogy was the work of an A-list blockbuster directer with a limitless \nbudget & endless resources, I don't think it's too out of line to touch on \nthe reality of the films' quality when some guy's treating them as if they \nwere *Lawrence of Arabia* or something - &, more or less unprovoked, \nknocking *B'89*.\n\n(Sorry for going off the trail there for a minute!)",

Bale's Bruce Wayne and Batman both sucked (yeah, I \nsaid it, fire away!), Gotham is so bland and boring, the pacing is all over \nthe place, and everything else is just \"meh\" except Two-Face's face. What \nI'm trying to say is, Ledger does not make the entire movie great when he \nis the only thing really good about it. My point is, even if you can make \nthe argument that Ledger's better than Nicholson, one that I completely \ndisagree with but anyway, taking both Jokers out of the equation, Batman \ndefeats TDK in every way, hands down; Batman himself, side characters, \nstory and storytelling, music, and style/atmosphere.
