            "text": "I'm grateful that this video was suggested to me. My dear Mom suddenly \npassed away like 10 days before we go to the Temple and seal as a family, \nThat was the dream I had after my mission. We prayed much and worked hard \nfor the Temple journey.(Where I live, we don't have a Temple) I was heart \nbroken and feeling numb! Because my Mom is not just my Mom, she was my Best \nfriend too, she was well prepared and was a wonderful example to me and \nDad. We went to the Temple without my dear Mother, I had a feeling she'd be \nthere in the Temple in spirit. In the Temple Dad and I felt the peace and \nwe got sealed as a family. However few weeks later, I was tempted to \nquestion God why my mom had to leave the earth before we go to the Temple, \nand I was having the most depressing time when my mom passed away, because \nnothing was working right in my life, but my dear Mother always encouraged \nme, things will work fine after going to the Temple. However my faith got \nshaken a lot. I didn't question God anymore because I felt like He has \nforgotten me. I wan't so bothered to go to the Church on Sundays or read \nscriptures. My prayers became much shorter.I was very unforgiving and got \nmad easily and I was looking for peace and happiness in other ways than the \nChrists way, It was today I felt the Spirit after going to the Temple. *Thank \nyou sooo much for this video!* I really want to be the person I used to be, \nthis little video just helped me to take a baby step. :) Now I'm gonna \nclean and tidy up my room and going to listen some GC talks and read \nscriptures. I know my Heavenly Father and earthly Father and my dear Mom in \nthe Spirit world going to be very happy about this. Thank you, Thank you \nsoooo much for sharing this.G'day! :)\ufeff",
