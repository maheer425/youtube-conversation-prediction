They \nare naturally loyal loving and protective. They get along with other dogs \nand cats if raised with them and socialised often. They love all their \nfamily members and will protect all of them, but they will always tend to \none particular family member just a little bit more. They need daily \nexercuse and love to play tug and seek games. If you want a loyal intuitive \nfriend who will love you with all their hearts and are prepared to spend \ndaily time with them and allow them inside with the family and involve them \nin your lives fully, the the German Shepherd is for you. Invest in a good \nvacum though as they shed ALOT!!!!!!\n\ufeff",

Their German Shep slept in the \nmiddle of the room on her carpet between me and the family, which was \nsitting on the couch. I'm very tall and came through the kitchen which is \nquite uncommon. The sleeping dog, not already woken up shot up and bite my \nforearm as a reflex of protective instinct. Then she realized me.\n\nThat hurts a lot and gets very blue, a strong protective breed. She felt \nvery, very ashamed about her mistake. The most impressive thing was her \nbehavior afterwards, how she came over the next day to apologize on her \nown. I will never forget her eyes. She came over and licked my arm and said \nsorry with her body, with her eyes. Call me mad, but I've not had such a \ndirect and emotional communication with a human for a long time. I've also \nhaven't had seen that much interpersonal skills with a human for years.\n\nBut I hate how they breeded the Sheps butt down over the last decades (not \nmy friends one, general), these manipulative assholes. That causes so much \nstruggle, illness and pain for the dogs. Please, please buy yourself an \nolder kind of this breed, with a normal shape, with a healthy straighten \nbutt!

Say \"No\" \nand gently hold his muzzle so he/she can't bite/mouth you. They will grow \nout of this in time. On the other side, use rewards such as a tummy scratch \nto reward good behaviour... not food snacks! They like it, and they will \ngive you the classic motorbike kick start manoeuvre! ;)  Be careful of over \nenjoyment from your dog on your return home... I mean... Don't let him/her \njump all over you when you return home from a long period. Yes it is cute, \nbut should not be encouraged. Shepherds will do this as they grow out of \npuppy stage. Lastly, expose him/her as much as possible to only your \nclosest friends and family. They are fiercely protective to what \"they\" \nconsider their \"own\" .
