(2) Inability to refrain from a behavior even when \nundesired consequences of it are acknowledged. (3) Cognitive difficulties \nin accurately recognizing the relation between a behavior and problems in \none\u2019s life.'*\n\nAs #2 says you can't stop, even when you know you're damaging your life, \neven when you'd do anything to stop, you do not actually have it within \nyour power to do so. As a result diets and cries for self restraint do \nnothing to help the food addict.

I ate almost the same things everyday, so I lost \nappetite and ate by force.\nI asked my mom what was the best way to gain weight because I do excercice \nand I want to have muscles and a nice body. I have always been skinny even \nthough through the years I have eaten very much. My mother told me to eat \nwhen I am hungry. It was not as easy for me as many because I just ate 4 \ntimes a day.\nThe solution for your problem is easy, but you need to control yourself or \nit won't help:\n- Do not buy candies, except for special occasions.\n- if you eat sweet things, remember that glutony is not good for your body. \nJust relax and tell yourself \"I do not need it.\" It is ok to like sweet \nthings (even though I think Americans exagerate), so be good with yourself, \ntoo.\n- Do not think you are being punished, because you will try to eat more \nwhen you have the opportunity.\n- If you eat less food (menos comida xD I don't know if I used correctly \nthe term, but ok.) your stomach will contract. Do not exagerate. ((My mom \nused to help in the hospital and people that had anorexia were not capable \nof eating well because their stomach was too small.))\n- Relax, enjoy. Just remember that you are better than an eating machine.\nI hope you overcome your problem :)\nRegards.",
