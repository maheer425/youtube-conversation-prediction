            "text": "The notion that good can't be used in place of well is false. Good has \nmultiple meanings, one of which is free from infirmity or sorrow, which is \nperfectly synonymous with the desired meaning of well. To say that saying, \n\"I'm doing good\" means you are literally doing good deeds is like saying \nthat, \"I'm doing well\" means you're doing a spring of water, which doesn't \nmake any sense. So yeah, I'm doing good.\n\nHere is an entry from the Merriam-Webster dictionary:\n\nUsage Discussion of GOOD\n\nAn old notion that it is wrong to say \u201cI feel good\u201d in reference to health \nstill occasionally appears in print. The origins of this notion are \nobscure, but they seem to combine someone's idea that good should be \nreserved to describe virtue and uncertainty about whether an adverb or an \nadjective should follow feel. Today nearly everyone agrees that both good \nand well can be predicate adjectives after feel. Both are used to express \ngood health, but good may connote good spirits in addition to good health.\n\nSide note: Never let anyone tell you how to talk. English is all made up \nand changes constantly (the same as any language.) While there are \nconventions considered to be proper, working outside of them is not \nincorrect. If it has meaning to the speaker then it's language, whether it \nis or isn't accepted as proper by the listener is moot. If someone speaks \nJapanese to me, just because I don't understand it doesn't mean it isn't a \nlanguage. There are countless dialects in the English language. If I say \nsomething that isn't \"proper\" English, then I merely created a new and \nunique dialect. So shove it you grammar Nazis. And don't even get me \nstarted on how loose punctuation can be.\ufeff",

To say that the English \nlanguage changes all the time anyways and so it's okay to use words \nincorrectly is justifying the improper spelling of words along with \nimproper grammar. While it can be generally accepted that the word \"good\" \ncan denote more than action- this has only become accepted because the \ngeneral populous has decided it to be so- hence Webster changing things. I \nthink it goes along the lines of \"Well, they're going to say it anyways, so \nmight as well make it official.\"\nWhich is why we have words like \"funner\" and people say things like \"More \nbetter\". Most of the time, I just sigh and ignore it, tho the use of \"your\" \nin place of \"you're\" is still a pet peeve. But regardless of English being \n\"made up\"- that sort of correct grammar usage will never change.\n\nAll in all. It's comedy, no need to get so riled up.",
