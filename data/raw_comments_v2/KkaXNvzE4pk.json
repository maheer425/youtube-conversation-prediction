I would forget I had encounters \nwith people at work or dinner with friends; like they never happened. I \nlost all memories of dating my wife, my son's first birthday, etc. It \ndidn't bother me at all. I didn't know what I forgot to remember :). It's \nbeen hard on my wife explaining things over and over. I've had to become a \nworld class organizer to survive. Meds help but not completely. My seizures \nare simple partial meaning I can have one while continuing to do whatever I \nwas doing. They feel like dejavu. I still have no ability to put names and \nfaces together. People at work smile and ask detailed questions about my \nlife, kids, wife, etc. and I have no idea who they are. Procedural things I \ncan do just fine. Like the video shows, the best part is I get to watch \nSilence of the Lambs, Star Wars, and Breaking Bad over and over and not \nknow the ending. Music is different. I remember most all the music I've \nheard. Just the band names are iffy. It's a very interesting predicament.\ufeff",

I compensated with working \nharder and pretty much sacrificed everything else to keep up.

This was because as explained in the video the procedural memory was \nintact and being a former soldier, I had the discipline to trust myself to \nhave completed the previous steps before moving on. So I could just look up \nmy notes and see what step I had reached and move on despite no memory of \nthe work I had done the last couple of hours.

A doctor suggests a solution that would remove the pain, but \nalso all of his senses (like touch, taste, smell, vision and hearing).\nThere is a scale by which one can judge whether this \"solution\" is the \nbetter choice to make. It measures \"quality of life\".\n\nWhen you consider the two possible states of being, in one your experience \nof life is neutral, softened or non-existent, and in the other it is very \nnegative. It would seem obvious which choice should be made: Remove the \npain & senses.\n\nThere is another scale that can be used here. It measures \"value of \nliving\". This scale isn't based on your experience of life, but what you're \ncapable of doing with it by will. If the pain was continuous or \ndebilitating to the extent that the man cannot move/communicate, both \noptions would have the same value on this scale, but in any other case the \nbetter choice would clearly be: Keep the pain & senses.\n\nPeople tend to use both of these scales in the judgments they make about \nthemselves, with a heavy emphasis on \"value of living\", but when it comes \nto making judgement about others, the primary scale used is \"quality of \nlife\".\n\nSo did MD make the right decision to allow for this change in his brain? I \nthink you'd need both scales to answer that question, but that's not \npossible. With our limited knowledge of MD's life, we may not know what the \nvalues might have been.",

In those cases;\nA. Nobody gave consent\nB. The experimentation was known to be harmful (often deadly)\nC. The procedures were needlessly cruel and not intended in anyway to cure \nanything. \n\nFor example, the Japanese systematically submerged people in ice baths and \ntimed how long it took them to die of hypothermia. They also performed live \nvivisections and had people raped purposefully to observe the affects of \nSTDs. (Seriously the list of things done at Unit 731 reads like a horror \nnovel).\n\nHaving said all that, some of the data the Japanese and Nazi's gathered is \nstill of medical relevance today, mainly because it couldn't be gathered \nany other way. That's not a statement of support, just an unsettling fact. \n\nAnyway, I don't object to what was done to HM. Risky medical procedures \nalways have a chance of going seriously wrong. As long as they exhausted \nother options and he was made fully aware of the danger, the ultimate \ndecision was his to make. \n\nGathering data after the experiment was done was also vital for other \npeople in future that might be in HM's situation, or have other \nneurological conditions.",
