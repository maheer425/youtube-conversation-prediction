            "text": "Thank you. I have a friend who was caught selling pills, I knew he did and \nsold a little bit of weed here and there (between friends and stuff), and \nthat he had access to a few pills, but when I was told what he went down \nfor, I was shocked. He was making $1,000 to $2,000 a week selling \ncontrolled medication, occasionally a little bit of meth, and little bit of \nweed (between some friends). He was charged with felony distribution, and \nwhat got him off the hook, was that he was a sophomore in high school, as \nwas I. You couldn't pick him out of a crowd, he was just your typical \nfunny, fluffy, high school student who drove a little old beat up Buick, \nand lived in a slightly older middle class neighborhood. He was able to \nmaintain his operation for about a year because he blended in, like the kid \nin the video. People need to realize that it isn't some \"racist system\", \nand that the way you act, is a big part in the way you are perceived. If \nyou're lower class, and have a new Cadillac with chrome rims and roll up \ninto your drive way in the projects, and get out with shoe game, and you're \nnot even \"fresh\", and just have that ghetto thug mentality and behavior, \nyou're going to get caught. My friend and the kid in the video are savvy \nbecause they looked like everyone else while rolling in an exceptional \namount of cash, and they both had a fairly long term operation. My friend's \noperation was constantly evolving to avoid getting caught, and when he did \nget caught, there wasn't much on him, because entire operation was dim, and \nhe was constantly cleaning up after himself, not leaving a trail or any \ndirect evidence. Due to this, he got a light sentence, even in terms of the \njuvenile system. Maximum gain, minimum loss, and it's all due to behavior, \nwhich is what idiots need to understand, but yet then again, why have \nintelligence when you have the race card.\n\nI know someone who was a substitute teacher in the juvenile justice system, \nand she is a sociology major. She and a few other sociologists were \nassigned to do demographics work on the juvenile system, and in their \nfindings, when they asked inmates \"why are you in here\", or \"what have you \nbeen charged with\" (no statements that assume guilt though, to be fair to \nthe individual), they found that lower class inmates, along with minorities \n(specifically African Americans) would typically have a response that \nadmitted to breaking the law, but not doing anything wrong, and they would \nblame being in there on someone else, not their own actions. One example \nwas when she asked one inmate \"why are you in here\", and his response was \n\"someone told on me\". Now, if you analyze that statement, there is no \"I \nwas caught\" or \"I did this and someone turned me in\", instead they are \nplacing the blame on someone else, and taking no responsibility for their \nown actions. They also found that African American adolescents in a house \nreceiving a lot of government aid, specifically government funded housing, \nhad the most self-centered and narcissistic mentality of any other inmates \nin that facility. One 16 year old in there had shot 6 people total, 5 of \nwhich died as a direct result of their injuries, in gang related hits over \nthe past 4 years. When she talked to him, his response was, and I quote \"I \nwas keepin' it real in da hood you know\", his head was up, he had a lot of \npride, and just that thug/thug wannabe behavior. He later on went to say \nthat the officer didn't have to shoot him (he was shot twice while being \narrested in a crack house raid, I've seen the helmet cam, he fired at the \nofficers and took two shots to the chest right after that, a third round \nskimmed his shoulder), and that the officers were \"racist\" (despite the \nfact more than 2/3s of the officers performing the raid were black, and the \noperation organizer was black, and the head detective, and the head of the \nsting operation), and as you know, he said all of this in a stupid ghetto \nlanguage that I'm ashamed to be able to depict (I don't know why though, \nbecause I've rarely ever been exposed to it), that makes anyone who speaks \nit fluently sound like a complete moron who needs to get their head checked \nand go back to kindergarten. This is all an example of people not taking \nresponsibility for their own actions, and they have been raised to believe \nthat they can do no wrong.",

So they extrapolated that the amount being \ngrown would produce enough to make 20k a month if sold at extremely high \nprices in small quantities.\n\nOverall it doesn't take brain surgery to profit from someone you know that \nis growing pot.  Everyone knows at least one person that smokes it... then \nthat person knows at least one person and so on.  It's how the black market \ncontinues to roll on.\n\nNow if we heard about this kid pulling it off and writing a book 20 years \nlater and not got busted in that time frame... sure.  Heck if he was the \none actually growing the pot for two years this story would be notable as \nthe kid was smart or business savvy.  Since he'd have to grow it and keep \nit under wraps.  To handle transactions... any moron w/ friends can do that.\n\nI'm with Ana on this... how in the hell did the parents not realize?  It \nsmells like they were involved in some way or this kid hasn't profited near \nas much as the police want to tout.  I know when I got busted right after \nhonorably exiting the army (while collecting unemployment from \ndischarge)... the local police made me out to be a drug dealing king pin.  \n\nI was allegedly the biggest drug dealer and the dominican connection for \nthe past two years in my area.  I was stationed overseas in Korea for \nseveral months they alleged I was dealing.  Then was at Ft. Hood with the \n1st Air Cav for a year of the allegations.  Easily refuted unless as a \nscout I was out practicing or making war plus in my \"spare time\" (LoL) I \nwas flying back to johnstown to sell pot.  It is true I made friends who \nwere Dominican while in the Army but I never sold drugs while enlisted nor \nwas ever busted making a sale to this date.  My overall point is I'm sure \nthis is just another sensationalized \"news\" report about this kid.\ufeff",
