Sweden is now number two on the list \nof rape countries, surpassed only by Lesotho in Southern Africa.\nSignificantly, the report does not touch on the background of the rapists. \nOne should, however, keep in mind that in statistics, second-generation \nimmigrants are counted as Swedes.\nIn an astounding number of cases, the Swedish courts have demonstrated \nsympathy for the rapists, and have acquitted suspects who have claimed that \nthe girl wanted to have sex with six, seven or eight men.\nThe internet radio station Granskning Sverige called the mainstream \nnewspapers Aftonposten and Expressen to ask why they had described the \nperpetrators as \"Swedish men\" when they actually were Somalis without \nSwedish citizenship. They were hugely offended when asked if they felt any \nresponsibility to warn Swedish women to stay away from certain men. One \njournalist asked why that should be their responsibility.\ufeff",

One should, however, keep in mind that in statistics, \nsecond-generation immigrants are counted as Swedes.In an astounding number \nof cases, the Swedish courts have demonstrated sympathy for the rapists, \nand have acquitted suspects who have claimed that the girl wanted to have \nsex with six, seven or eight men.The internet radio station Granskning \nSverige called the mainstream newspapers Aftonposten and Expressen to ask \nwhy they had described the perpetrators as \"Swedish men\" when they actually \nwere Somalis without Swedish citizenship. They were hugely offended when \nasked if they felt any responsibility to warn Swedish women to stay away \nfrom certain men. One journalist asked why that should be their \nresponsibility.",

Four years have passed since the \nbeginning of that great internal revolution which in the meantime has been \ngiving a new aspect to German life. This is the period of four years which \nI asked the German people to grant me for the purpose of putting my work to \nthe test and submitting it to their judgment. Hence at the present moment \nnothing could be more opportune than for me to render you an account of all \nthe successes that have been achieved and the progress that has been made \nduring these four years, for the welfare of the German people. But within \nthe limits of the short statement I have to make it would be entirely \nimpossible to enumerate all the remarkable results that have been reached \nduring a time which may be looked upon as probably the most astounding \nepoch in the life of our people. That task belongs rather to the press and \nthe propaganda. Moreover, during the course of the present year there will \nbe an Exposition here in Berlin which is being organized for the purpose of \ngiving a more comprehensive and detailed picture of the works that have \nbeen completed, the results that have been obtained and the projects on \nwhich work has been begun, all of which can be explained better in this way \nthan I could do it within the limits of an address that is to last for two \nhours. Therefore I shall utilize the opportunity afforded me by this \nhistoric meeting of the Reichstag to cast a glance back over the past four \nyears and call attention to some of the new knowledge that we have gained, \nsome of the experiences which we have been through, and the consequences \nthat have resulted therefrom\u2014in so far as there have a general validity. It \nis important that we should understand them clearly, not only for our own \nsake but also for that of the generations to come.",

In Stockholm during the summer the sun rise about 3.30-4.30AM \nand then the sun set is at about 21-22PM during the winter the sun rise \nabout 7-8.30AM and sets at about a bit before 3-5PM. But it's also a pretty \nbig difference between the north and the south parts of Sweden, in the very \nnorth the sun never rise during a part of the winter and never sets during \na part of the summer. To explain this better for those who don't live in \nSweden, to me the winter is kinda depressing and dark and cold, in December \nit's usually dark outside when you go to school and dark again when it's \ntime to go home. On the other hand, the summer in Sweden is really nice, \nwarm but not way too warm and never too dark. ",
