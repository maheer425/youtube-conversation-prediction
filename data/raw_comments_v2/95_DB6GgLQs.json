And Marty went back to the dock so why didn't they \njust take the gas from the hidden car?

It was still something of a stretch.  \nMarty pays for his coffee and uses the pay phone.  A pay phone with a \nrotary dial.  Hey I grew up in the 80s, and while I did know \"what\" a \nrotary phone was (since there were plenty of old movies and old TV shows in \nreruns all the time in the 80s, so you had an idea of past technology like \nrotary phones and slide rulers), I sure as hell don't remember seeing \nANYONE using a rotary phone in the 80s.  Not in the early 80s or late 80s.  \nGranted I was young, but I don't remember rotary phones in public \nor private places.  So it was weird they made such a big scene about Marty \nhaving trouble opening a Coke bottle from the 1950s, but he so easily \nfigured out the rotary phone.   ",

The sequels were about \nMarty himself learning from both Doc and Seamus to reel it in a bit, and \nwhen man has to know to walk away and let words just be words.  Seamus \nwasn't a confrontational man like his brother Martin that got stabbed, or \nlike his great great grandson Marty, but he didn't let what people said \naffect him.

There was a \ntimeline where Marty disappeared forever.  The universe did this to balance \nthings out to self-heal from riffs that could destroy the fabric of time. \n Doc was mistaken about universe-ending paradoxes.  The universe has time \ntravel healing designed into it.  Doc wasn't that great of a scientist. \n The time machine was a fluke--inspired more by the mysticism of inspired \npsychic vision that scientific talent (as shown in the movie that the head \nbump brought a vision of the flex capacitor.)  The greatest truth that Doc \nand Marty did not figure out was that Timelords were interacting with Doc \nand Marty and moving the plot along for their own amusement.\ufeff",
