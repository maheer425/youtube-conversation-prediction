As they pack \ntogether they get denser and thus would sink. But water, as per the video, \nhas hydrogen bonds. When water gets colder they start sharing hydrogen \natoms, forming structures. When they get warmer the hydrogen bonds form and \nbreak up frequently. Because of the bonds at the colder end, they take up \nless space, thus floats. All of this was in the video.",
