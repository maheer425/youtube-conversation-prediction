That's \ncurrently a highly debated subject and there's only a few facts we can say \nfor sure right now. First, you have the most number of brain cells the \nmoment you're born and begin the process of synaptic \"pruning\" throughout \nmaturity and most sharply by adolescence. Though Neuronal count decreases, \nbrain volume increases with age until adulthood because of mylenation. What \npeople assumed was that number of brain cells and number of synaptic \nconnections is associated with intelligence, but in reality, the \"unused\" \nconnections are pruned away to make for more resources towards connections \nthat are used. Also, cognition is believed to decline after ages 25-30 but \nthat's challenged by studies that show brain plasticity well in to age 60s. \nThe problem is we know too little about the brain to make too many simple \nassumptions. We're born with more than we need, and we end up with the \nuseful ones until the effects of age catch up with us and begin our \ndecline. That is different from person to person and depends largely on \ngenetics, lifestyle and social sphere/culture.\ufeff",
