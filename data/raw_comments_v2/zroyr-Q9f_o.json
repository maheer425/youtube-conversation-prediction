Such a vehicle could fly to \nthe moon in an hour, Mars in a day, the asteroid belt in 2 days, or Jupiter \nin a matter of days-- all on solar-powered plasma-drive, because of the \nhuge energy-mass ratio.  \nAnother possibility of graphene is self-replicating machines, which convert \nlocal carbon into machines that either perform functions, or create other \nmachines; this could convert cabon-based planets into livable cities in a \nmatter of days, complete with solar-powered electricity and breathable \noxygen. This could convert  the  moon into a giant city in days, Mars in \nweeks, along with the asteroid belt into giant space-cities (since it's 3/4 \ncarbon), and  with the moons of Jupiter and Saturn in roughly the same \ntime. Mercury could also be converted in about a day, due to the intense \nsolar energy. \ufeff",

On top of that, no material is defect free, meaning the \ntheoretical strength misrepresents it's true strength. Also, the hallmark \nof good structural engineering materials is also safe failure, but carbon \nnanotubes build up a ton of elastic energy before they fracture suddenly \n(i.e. not safely).

Dr. Kaku says something quite silly here: \nsaran wrap made of one layer of graphene could support the weight of an \nelephant standing on a pencil....\n\nIt is popularized, online, that graphene as thick as saran wrap could \nsupport an elephant. This is wrong for many reasons; you cannot stack \ngraphene sheets to the thickness of saran wrap because then you're back to \ngraphite. And a layer of graphite this thickness would be difficult to \nhandle without crumbling, let alone the elephant!\n\nSo what if you take the atoms in a sheet of graphene and make those as \nthick as saran wrap? Well, not even nuclear physics allows for this \nexperiment, so it's literally NOT physically possible! That's as valid as \nsaying \"if you could enhance the strength of the weakest material ever, it \ncould potentially be the strongest material ever.\"\ufeff",

From the mass, the force of gravity, and the surface area, \none could in theory derive a very rough estimation for pressure. Also, a \npencil is filled with graphite, composed of grapheme, so if what Dr. Kaku \nproposes is true, then a pencil should be able to support the weight of an \nelephant because it's thousands of times the thickness of Saran wrap! \n(Gotcha-- we both know it couldn't) But I digress...\nThe more important thing is that inflating the properties of graphene does \nnot help explain the properties; it simply exaggerates them. There's no \nphysical realities in the information he provides.\nTo illustrate the concept, I would simply compare numbers.
