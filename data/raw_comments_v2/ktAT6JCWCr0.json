I personally would've gone for the kill, but at the \nsame time I don't have the mindset of Hiccup, who's alot more passionate \nand kind about things, if I were in this situation there probably wouldn't \nhave been a damn movie, I can say that probably that goes for all of us, we \neither would've just left Toothless after shooting him down, or straight up \ntried to stab him and either succeed or get eaten and blown up.
