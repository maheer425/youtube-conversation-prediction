If you consider every dinosaur to be a reptile and the \nfact that some flew, some swam and others stayed on land, there really \nshouldn't have been that many different types. Look at mammals today, some \nswim, some fly and the rest stayed on land, but I'm pretty sure we've \ndiscovered the majority of mammals that will ever exist. According to this \nvideo we may be discovering different types of dinosaurs for, maybe another \n200 years. That isn't including any we won't find due to their remains \nbeing in places we can't go, i.e. the bottom of the ocean. That's a sh*t \nton of different dinosaurs. LOL! I could see God wearing a I love Dinos \nt-shirt in his lab just going crazy creative like this should have spikes, \nand this has a long neck, and this one has a razor sharp albeit ugly \nlooking toe, and this one...\ufeff",

The first: depending on how you classify animals, \nmammals count as reptiles since mammals evolved from reptiles, therefore \nlarge (particularly strange) reptiles are /still/ the most dominant \n(depending on your definition of dominant) form of terrestrial animal life. \nThe second: dinosaurs of various types dominated terrestrial ecosystems for \n135 million years and finally lost that spot to mammals around 65 million \nyears ago; in other words dinosaurs were dominant on this planet for about \ntwice as long as they have been \"gone\" with only their descendants the \nbirds remaining. That second idea should show why there are so many types \nof dinosaurs out there, you should expect there to be around twice, though \nthat number is not guaranteed by any means.",
