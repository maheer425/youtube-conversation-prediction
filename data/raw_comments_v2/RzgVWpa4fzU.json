The failure was cultural and sociological. There \nwill always be conflict - our most scarce resource will always be time. \nEven in Star Trek, the replicators only produced one object at a time. And \neven if everyone had their own personal replicator, there are other natural \nconstraints - to use a recent experience - nearly anyone who wants to watch \nthe Super Bowl can find a means to do so, but there will always be a \nlimited number of seats at the venue itself. And its still costs time, \nwhich most gladly pay. And, obviously, there will be an even greater limit \non who can play in the Super Bowl, and who can hold the trophy at the end \nof the game. The constraints will cause conflicts, yet they do not \nnecessarily have to be harmful. \n\nSo to achieve a utopian society (or the closest that humanity can attain on \nthis lovely rock hurtling through the universe), the answer lies not in \naddressing the economics of scarcity, but in addressing the inevitable \nconflicts that will occur. Thankfully, we are seeing tremendous progress in \nthis area along with technological advances. From good governance \ninitiatives at the macro level to non-violent communication and conflict \nresolution training at the personal level, social scientists, including \nsocial workers, have enriched our understanding of human behavior and found \nfar better means of resolving conflicts than 'might makes right', or \n'whoever has the gold, makes the rules'. This is not to claim that those \nmethods have ceased to exist (any glance at the news proves otherwise), but \nthose methods have lost any claims to scientific validity, and are quickly \nlosing political and cultural legitimacy as well. \n\nSociety progresses along with technology, often in a wonderful symbiosis, \nwith new technologies (particularly in the field of communication and \ninformation, such as our host here) enabling social advances that in turn \nenable more people to engage in the pursuit of technology.\n\nWhich leads to the last point - our knowledge has expanded far beyond the \nlimits of any persons individual ability. It is currently stretching the \nlimits of many organizations. Only the very largest can keep their eyes on \nevery field and endeavor, and even then, lack the capability of acting on \nthat information proactively in the majority of circumstances. Thus the \nimperative before us is to learn cooperative methods and practice better \nmeans of dispute resolution at the macro and micro levels. \nThe final caveat is that democratic governance cannot work at the political \nlevel when it is not practiced at the economic level. As long as \nnon-democratic organizations continue to have undue and illegitimate \ninfluence on the political process, any utopian ideal will certainly never \nbe realized, or anything that remotely resembles it. \n\nNamaste to all those that read this far!\ufeff",

But then there will be another scarcity which will also be \nanswered by another technology and so on until we become a super \nintelligence expanding through the universe in order to harness as much \nmatter and energy so we can expand our intelligence further - therefore our \nscarcity will be that of speed. As we approach the saturation of matter and \nenergy in our universe we will eventually have scarcity of matter and \nenergy themselves which will mean we will have to invent our way into other \nuniverses or switching into a new paradigm of existence - like becoming an \n11 dimensional super intelligent species.

One must realize that it is a cultural thing.\n\nThe word 'bad', 'right' 'wrong' and 'good' is all social constructions. \nThings we have been taught and learned. It is not something we just know. A \nbully for example is a bully not (often) because he wanted to but because \nhim/her-self want to dish out what he/she received. Such a person often \ngoes with the logic of \"I was bullied and so will you because its fair\".\n\nThe meaning behind bad is contextualized by where and when you do it. Is a \npatriotic soldier not a trained serial-killer? What is the difference when \nyou strip away the facade?

We must also recognize that evil does \nnot exist as the perception of good and evil is subjective. Nothing but you \nyourself can define what is good and what's bad.\n\nEvil simply does not exist outside of our own individual brain. For example \nI see you as an 'evil' because I perceive you as a troll... or just simply \nsomeone that needs to be educated. I see myself as 'good' as I in a \nromanticized way am trying to 'cure the illness, the evil' I read from your \ncomments.\n\nWe humans are not evil, we are not good either. We simply are. It is the \npeople around us that shapes our views, our sense of right and wrong. We \nalone can't recognize anothers sense of 'good' and 'bad' actions if that \nsame person has not been brought up/ taught by the same general group of \npeople you yourself have been taught by.\n\nFor example if I take something that is yours (intentionally or not) you \nwill automatically label me a thief and a bad person because of it. You \nwill think this because it is how you probably have been taught to react.\n\nI on the other hand will most likely not consider myself a bad person. I \nwould most probably call myself good as I have been taught to look out for \nmyself, and most probably I did that by taking that something that was \nyours.\n\nxXx\n\n So yeah...

What we know from 15 years of good studies is that \nall of these people show remarkably consistent changes in brain patterns - \ne.g. increased activity in areas associated with compassion and empathy, \ndecreased activity in areas associated with mental chatter and rumination, \netc.  Huge changes, in fact.  These people have no desire to dominate \nothers or control the world.  They are not zoned-out zombies and the \nsocieties they lived in were certainly not utopias.  But they consistently \nrate very high on self-reported levels of contentment and in the neural \ncorrelates of a contented life. \n\nWhat I am suggesting is that we develop technologies that can help everyone \nto attain the same state of being without the insane amounts of time and \neffort these people have devoted to practice (such as 100,000 hours of \nmeditation).  If *everyone* becomes like them, they will not have any \ndesire to rule over others or establish a dystopian techno-dictatorship.  \nIt will not make people in to pushovers either, in fact advanced meditators \nare extraordinarily resilient to adversity and are often highly critical of \noppressive regimes.",
