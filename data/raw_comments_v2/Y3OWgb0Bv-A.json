Humans don't \"need\" three arms to \nsurvive, so anyone born with three arms will not have an advantage. And \nbecause it would be quite disturbing, that person would likely not have \nchildren so the \"three arm gene\" would be lost. To answer your question \nabout the balls, let's say we have a creature with two bones, the bones \nwill indeed rub together and be damaged, if a gene mutation makes some kind \nof protecting tissue in between those bones. That creature will have an \nadvantage and will be more likely to pass on it's genes. As more and more \npositive mutations occur, the tissue will become stronger and eventually \ntake a shape which gives the most strength and flexibility (which is a bal \napparently). I would like to remember you how long 4,6 billion years is, \nthe craziest things can evolve in such a long time. To wrap it up, I leave \nmany unanswered questions simply because I am not a biologist. I would like \nto compliment your critical view on this subject. But I would like to leave \nit at this.

A creature without any form of \nmuscle would not be able to move (btw i'm talking about animal life, not \nplant life that's a different story. As a life form gets bigger it needs \nbones for structural strength. Probably the first boned creature had only \none bone, a spine or something. So when more bones were required as the \ncreature evolves, bone joints were required too. So I think muscles evolved \nfirst and then bone joints. I don't know if I'm right, I didn't google any \nof this but I just wanted to show you things like this can be 'solved' with \nlogic (what I just said was a hypothesis, to solve the problem you would \nhave to look at fossils).
