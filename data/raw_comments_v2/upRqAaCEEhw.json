If after all discoveries have been processed and \nrecognized and after all the important names in the history book of Europa, \nif there was a section that put your name for contribution/funding, \nwouldn't you want to be a part of that. I would love to have my name in a \nbook other than a yearbook or one that wrote my own name in, for my kids \nand their kids to see. This message probably won't get noticed or will get \nchewed up by critics, but Mr. Nye if you see this it could possibly work. I \ndon't have much money but I would contribute the cost of a few cups of \ncoffee if I knew it was put towards exactly what was offered.
