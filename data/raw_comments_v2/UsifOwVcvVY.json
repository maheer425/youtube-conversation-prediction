Scarra \nsaid everything, Katarina is one of the hardest champions on the game, she \nis easy to play vs silver/gold but VERY HARD to play at higher elos. And \nthis isn't because \"the enemy team has cc, they can stop your ultimate\" as \nsome less skilled players usually say, BUT because of her lane phase. Most \nchampions can outfarm her easily, so the key to win a lane is to be \nextremelly agressive, as Scarra said and I absolutelly agree. Poke hard \nwith Q, max W to farm better undertower, and keep poking. Buy boots and \npotions for sustain until you see an opportunity to flash, E Q W and \nignite, ward-jump or minion-jump to safety after you kill your opponent. I \nhave tried almost every single build on her. I'm not the \"single target\" \nkind of player, so most of the times I don't rush DFG. I prefer Zhonyas for \nutility and outplay. Some heavy-counters to katarina if played by a same \nskilled player: Kassadin, Xerath, Riven, Malphite AP, Tristana AP, Syndra \nand late-game Veigar. Some champions I absolutelly crush: Ignite-Lux, \nDiana, Zed (5 pots+armor), Yasuo late game, Akali late game, Talon, Leblanc \n(after nerf). Champions that are usually even with Katarina: Ahri, Ziggs, \nOrianna, Cassiopeia, Zyra, Brand. These last players require the absolute \ntiming and aim to instantly kill Katarina, and that's where a simple \ncooldown or mistake can make the difference. Sorry for the long post and \nfeel free to give your opinion, there's always things to improve :) \nPS: Sunfire-Katarina works extremely well vs a full ad team, and especially \nvs a Zed! Give it a try!\ufeff",

Not only do you have \nto learn the champ, you're going to have to learn all of her matchups to \nthe core of the core. Not to mention ward jumping with her takes a little \ntime to get used to. Managing Kat's resets is what seperates a good Kat \nplayer from a great one in my opinion. I myself still haven't completely \nmastered it. Sure you can just face smash the keyboard in teamfights but \nthat almost never works out unless the other team is all low or you're \nextremely fed. Usually you want your W to do as much AOE damage as possible \nwhen you shunpo to multiple players while also timing the CD on everyone's \nCC, meaning I can't just kill someone and then jump to the nearest player \nwho happened to be lee sin who can ult me the second I get onto him. It \nreally isn't that hard to learn and be good with any champ but becoming \ngreat with that champ is the real challenge. Lol I got butt hurt a little, \nsorry >.<",

When i was \nunranked i played Katarina on mid vs Katarina who was Gold 3 and i beat a \nliving crap out of him! I was like 21/4/6 and he was 9/15/8. I am good \nplayer i was just too lazy to play ranked, that's why i was unranked. When \ni made my 2nd pentakill on ranked with Kata i played with my friend who is \nbronze 4, 2 guys who were silver 5, and one guy who was bronze 1. In enemy \nteam there was 1 guy who is Gold 5, one silver 3, one silver 1, and other 2 \nplayers were silver 5.\nAnd i have friend who is unranked because he is too lazy to play ranked but \nhe is really good player.\nSo, yeah, divisions sometimes mean nothing.
