He fixed/corrected what was wrong, BUT he did not notice that he \nwas no longer on the right lane of the road going in whatever direction was \nthe correct direction.  This was an Interstate where roads parallel, where \nthe median separates the two roads, with multiple lanes, going in opposite \ndirections.\n\nThen this scene happens.  So, John Candy is going in the opposite direction \nthat he should have been going, thinking that the couple yelling at them \nare in the next lane, not across the median, on the opposite road of the \nInterstate.  Basically, he was on a head on collision with any upcoming \ntraffic, which of course, ended up being the two 18-wheelers, which was \nHILARIOUS!!\n\nI was with my parents the first time that was saw this on a VCR.
