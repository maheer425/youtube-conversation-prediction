At some point I stopped following Teen \nTop, I'm not sure why maybe because they are not very well promoted as they \nshould be. I dont dislike the other boygroups but they are all very similar \nand I cant tell them apart most of the times. Their songs are not catchy \nand most of the times they try to look hip hop/emo/sexy/badass  which is \nnot a very good combination. I respect Teen Top for being true to \nthemselves musically and being unapologetically pop. ...Oh I remembered why \nI stopped following them, I profoundly hate Niel. I wish he would never go \non public again, other than that I would like to see more of teen top and \nsee them at their right place at the top.\ufeff",
