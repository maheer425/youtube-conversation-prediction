            "text": "Lol at your DNR tattoo.  In my state there is one form and one form only \nwhich is valid for a DNR.  It requires the signature of two physicians \nverifying that the applicant has a terminal condition.  If dispatch sends \nfire or EMS to your house and no one can produce the form, it is as if the \nform does not exist: you are getting CPR.  Also, your assertion that \"it's \nnot done right if ribs are not broken is also incorrect.  Perhaps your \nosteoporosis could result in breaks, but it is usually the cartilage which \nconnects the ribs to the sternum which dislocates and \"pops\" that people \ninterpret as a break.  A young person with flexible cartilage may not even \nexperience that.  For lay people (the target audience for this hands-only \napproach to CPR) there are laws to protect them, as mentioned above. But \nthanks for your unnecessary and misleading rant.  Who knew osteoporosis \nmade people that grumpy?",
