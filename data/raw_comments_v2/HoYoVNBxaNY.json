Link started the rap and Rhett returned each \nrhyme, then about a minute in, they use a transition with shorter rhymes so \nthen link has passed the rhyme basically because when he said \"my daddy \ninvented the wheel\"\nRhett didn't rhyme back, so he began the next few verses with the main \nrhyme that Link responded too. Then they swapped off again when Rhett said \n\"my daddy can beat up your daddy\" and that switched it back over to Link to \nstart the verses. Very clever lyrical writing. \ufeff",
