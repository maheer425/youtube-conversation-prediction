I'm not saying \nthat everyone is materialistic, or that you should be judgmental or that \nyou can choose how and when to love. What I'm saying is, this man loved \nDaniel because of his personality. The fact that he was magnetic, and \nseemed to have time for everyone. That's a condition. If Daniel had been \nselfish, rude or violent, would he have felt the same way?\nAnd is it always a good idea to follow love? What about in instances of \nabuse? People often say that they will hold on to their friendships no \nmatter what. What if this friend doesn't feel the same way? What if this \nfriend takes advantage of you, for no other reason other than that they \ndon't value your friendship? I'm not ashamed to say that my friendships are \nconditional in that way - if they are in trouble, or have motivation to be \nacting in a certain way (depression, desperate circumstances) that's \ndifferent. But people who treat you badly for selfish reasons are just not \nworth your time.\nI'm glad that this video brings other people joy, but it's a far too \nsimplistic outlook for me.\ufeff",
