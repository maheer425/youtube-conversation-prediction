This \nargument is based on the fact that the ratio of \u221a2 to 1 becomes the ratio \nof 1 to \u221a2 when you divide the larger amount (the longer side) by 2.\n\nYou start with a ratio of \u221a2:1. Divide the larger amount (the longer side) \nby 2, you get (\u221a2/2):1. But if you multiply (\u221a2/2) by \u221a2 top and bottom, \nyou get (2/2\u221a2), which is equal to (1/\u221a2). So the new ratio becomes \n(1/\u221a2):1, which is the same as the ratio \u221a2:1. And so on ad infinitum: the \nratio of the sides will always be \u221a2:1 when you halve the longer side.\ufeff",

The best we can do is conclude that a is divisible \nby the square-free part of c.  i.e., we know that the product of all the \nprimes which divide c must also divide a.\n\nExamples: if a^2 is divisible by 4, the only prime dividing 4 is 2, so we \ncan conclude that a is divisible by 2.  \nIf a^2 is divisible by 6, the primes dividing 6 are 2 and 3, so a is \ndivisible by 2*3 = 6.\nIf a^2 is divisible by 12, the primes dividing 12 are 2 and 3, so a is \ndivisible by 2*3 = 6.\n\nSo really, the proof you gave above would go like this:\n\n4 = a^2 / b^2\n4 b^2 = a^2\na^2 is divisible by 4, so a is divisible by 2, so let's call it a = 2c\n4 b^2 = (2c)^2\n4 b^2 = 4 c^2\nb^2 =  c^2\nb = \u00b1 c\nLooking back, we have a = 2c and b = \u00b1 c,\nso 4 = (2c)^2 / (\u00b1c)^2\nSo, 4 = 4 c^2 / c^2\n4 = 4",

In fact, you can scale and keep proportion with any side \ndivided by side factor. A mathematician should learn to watch his words \nbetter than this. The motive og the Ax format is like this: It should be \nmetric and the different standard sizes of the format should be possible to \ndeduced from the least amount of facts. Preferably only one fact about how \nto scale and only one fact about the index. The only possible solution to \nthis problem in the non complex space is \"the larger side divided by the \nsmaller is square root of two and index A0 is one square meter. Any other \nproportion will scream for a need to remember x or y for all the different \nsizes. Sure it was a clever idea if the most important thing was to have \nthe least number of facts to transpose between the sizes, but it really \nisn't. Much more important is to have a format that makes sense to they who \nuse the different sizes. Like for the A4 which is used for letters. \nEverybody knows square root two makes the width far too big. The margins \nwill be far too big when choosing a width that makes it easy to keep track \nof the lines and the hight is far to short for a letter, spcially an \ninvoice. It would make so much more sense to choose the golden rate as the \nproportion. Still you could use square root two to be your scaling factor, \nbut you wouldn't be able to scale by divide long side by two or mutiplay \nshort side by two, but when did you need that?\ufeff",

So, proof by contradiction is a very clever technique \nthat can be used to show certain statements are false.  Let's say you want \nto show that statement P is false.  If you assume that P is true, and by \nthis assumption, you arrive at a contradiction (a statement which is always \nfalse), then you know P must actually be false! (Since true statements \ncannot imply false statements.)  That is what is done here.\n\nHere, we want to show that sqrt(2) is irrational, i.e., not rational.  To \ndo this, we assume that sqrt(2) *is* rational.  In other words, we assume \nsqrt(2) = a/b where a/b is in lowest terms (every fraction can be reduced \nto lowest terms! just divide both a and b by their greatest common divisor \nif a/b isn't already in lowest terms).  So, assuming that sqrt(2) = a/b is \na fraction in lowest terms, we show that a and b are both even, meaning \nthey can both be divided by 2, meaning that a/b is not in lowest terms.\n\nBy assuming sqrt(2) was rational and equals a/b, we showed that a/b is \n*both* in lowest terms and *not* in lowest terms at the same time!  This is \nimpossible!  It's a contradiction.  So it must be the case that sqrt(2) is \nnot rational, or is irrational.",

However, in the U.S., where we use 8.5 x \n11 in. paper, if we cut our paper in half, it is 5.5 x 8.5 in., which \nis different from the original whole size, proportion-wise (and hence \ndisproportionate is the correct term). I'll try to give you an example:\n\nImaging scaling an image on 8.5 x 11 in. paper. Let's also assume that the \nimage takes up the ENTIRE paper, so it has an area of 93.5 sq. in. If we \nwant to scale it down to 50%, we want it to occupy an area of 46.75 sq. \nin., where the proportions of each side (we'll call them A and B) is equal \nto 8.5 x 11 in.. In other words the proportion (A:B) is equal to (8.5:11) \nsuch that A*B = 46.75. Solving for this system will give you an image with \nsides [A = 6.011 in. and B = 7.778 in.] The proportion is also equivalent \nto the original size, however it would be difficult to create this without \nwasting a bit of paper.\n\nI sure hope that helped...",
