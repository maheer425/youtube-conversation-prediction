I guarantee you that most people who commented on this video \nsaying a negative thing are very jealous and unhappy with their own lives, \nbecause they are sitting in front of a screen hating. Whilst jay and alexis \nare not affected at all by the negativity and are out there exploring the \nworld and having fun adventures. I have so much respect for jay and alexis \nand i say continue with your adventure and continue inspiring others to do \nthe same because we need more people in this world like you guys \ud83d\udc96 I'm \nlooking forward to the video in Tahiti \ufeff",
