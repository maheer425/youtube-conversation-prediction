So \n,this region expands and you dont have to consider the relativistic effect \nof the expansion but only the effect of the movement.\n\nThis effect which I have described has to do with time dilation and \nsynchronization .Of course does the effect of gravitational time dilation \nplay an important role as well, if the planet on which they live has a \nhigher or lower gravitation than earth. But in this thought experiment you \ncan disregard some of those effects. It should only show the existence and \nappearance of the different time slices, allthough this idea still doesnt \nexplain what time actualy is and why the different slices change for us . \nOr in other words ,why we move from one slice to a parallel one. \n\nA flat space time does not necessarily mean a static universe. However, so \nbecause of the fact that the curvature decides which form the universe has( \nnegative curvature = infinite size, positive curvature from mass and energy \n= finite , shaped like a sphere or hypertorus etc . ).  It applies that \nparallel photon lines would come closer inside curved space time and are \nalways parallel inside a not-curved space. At the beginning of the universe \n, as the photons were created , it was spread all around through other \nradiatons and atoms etc. .So we could find out from the smallest shapes and \npattern of the background radiation that the space should be infinite in \nsize with a deviation from 1 percent. This shape can tell us about the \ncurvature. It is like as if you would throw a stone on flat water and \ndetermine the waves. And the observation fits with our calculations.\nIt is very probable that the deviation is because of our not so precise \nmeasurements but many people think this indicates that we live on a finite \nuniverse. \nI think the infinite version is the case. Even if we lived on a sphere, the \nspace in which it would be embedded would have been infinite in size , not \nconsidering the fact that we arent able to describe a 4-d sphere version \nwith our mathematics.\n\nSo if space would be realy infinite in size, then one part of space is \nstill able to expand inside itself.

And that when it has no or \nlittle mono-directional velocity (lateral?) it spends its speed in angular \nvelocity instead, so that the two added together still equals to C (lateral \n+ angular). So the slower the 'particle' is in lateral velocity the \nstronger the effect of the strong force, thus the particle decays/lives at \na faster pace (and also attracts the matter around it to itself, or for \nobjects, contract themselves). Conversely, the higher the lateral velocity, \nthe weaker the strong force, and the object expends itself (in the \ndirection of motion), and any in system motion is slowed down.
