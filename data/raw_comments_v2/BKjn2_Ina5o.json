(It reminds me a bit of \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\", not \nthat many BLR fans would know that song...) When I first heard this song, I \nalso thought the lyrics took a dark turn around 2:16-2:26: not only does \nthe melody become darker, but the lyrics seem almost apocalyptic to me. \n\"Who do you think would win in a bear fight in the night\" seems to evoke \nsomething powerful, disturbing, and uncontrollable, almost like he's saying \n\"Judgement Day is coming and we'll all die\". Then the especially haunting \nline: \"Who's gonna hoard dark water for days?\" That sounds like it means \nsomething like: After the apocalypse, people will be driven crazy by the \nlack of necessities and will be driven to hoarding polluted water to drink. \nThat pair of lines sounds very philosophical and Pink-Floydian (look it up \nif you don't know what that means), certainly dark, cryptic, apocalyptic \nPink Floyd-like sentiments. And then, of course, he collapses our neat \nlittle house of cards by declaring \"Can't be around dogs who fart all the \ntime!\".",
