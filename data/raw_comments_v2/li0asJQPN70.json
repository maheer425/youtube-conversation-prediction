Almost as good as The Queen's Classroom, which \nis my favorite!!\nEveryone knows I love Eunjung, but in DH, my favorite character was\nHye Mi (Suzy). At the beginning she was so stuck up, but ended up being so \nawesome!! A great friend to Baek Hee (Eunjung)!!\nJin Gook (Taecyeon) probably never even liked Baek Hee as a person, cuz he \nknows she was the one that tried to hurt Hye Mi.\nSo even though she liked him, he would never like her back!!\nIn DH2, Rian (Jiyeon) was the same as Hye MI from DH. Very stuck up at the \nbeginning, but by the end had changed so much!!\nEpisode 1 of DH2 was very confusing!! I almost stopped watching it after \nthat, but decided to keep going.\nI'm glad I did, because I like it a lot!!\nSo in DH2 my favorite character was Rian!!\nNana (Hyolyn), I liked, too. Even though she was an idol, she never acted \nlike it. She was so nice!!\nWell, it's time to get ready for work or I would keep on going!!\nSo yeah, DH better than DH2, but DH2 was still good!!",

It \nwas a direct competition, along with IU's Red Shoes.  That led me to After \nSchool, Nana, Raina, Lizzy and eventually OC in that order, with you \nsomewhere connected in between it all.^^  She was not forgettable to me \nbecause of that connection, plus I think she is elegant, with high \ncheekbones, and of course those dimples! ^^\n\nYou know she was a dancer before becoming a singer......
