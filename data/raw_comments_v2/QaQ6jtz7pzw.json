            "text": "Visible light, ultraviolet light, radio waves, gamma waves, and the other \nkinds of radiation that I forget are all technically the same thing. They \nare all the same energy, just moving in increasingly smaller waves. If you \nwere to somehow lengthen the wavelength of gamma radiation, you would \neventually turn it into visible light. Not that we are currently aware of \nany way to actually do that, mind you.\n\nOur eyes are only \"wired\" to receive a wavelength of radiation from the \ncolor we call blue to the color we call red. Anything beyond that \nwavelength is too fast/small for us to see. One could argue that our eyes \nevolved to see this specific wavelength since this is the most common form \nof radiation on our planet. The early organisms that were born with birth \ndefects that interpreted what we call visible light into a stimulus that \ngave them a general idea of how the world looked around them had a \ncompetitive edge over other organisms and thus were more likely to survive \nand pass on their genes.\n\nIf, for some idiotic reason, there were a planet with an abundance of gamma \nradiation, it would be reasonable to imagine that at some point, the \norganisms on that planet (assuming they were somehow resistant to the \nradiation) would evolve ocular nerves that used a wavelength including \ngamma radiation to visually sense their surroundings. Of course, their \nocular nerves would probably fail to be stimulated by visible light.\n\nSince our ocular nerves were developed at such an early stage that pretty \nmuch all animals share the common ancestor, we all have eyes that work \nessentially the same. The only major variation is that a lot of animals \ndon't have cones in their eyes, only rods. This means that they cannot see \ncolor, only black and white.\n\nBut, if we were to imagine life evolving on another planet, it would, of \ncourse, lack our common ancestry. Thus, their ocular nerves, should they \nevolve any, would not even necessarily interpret the stimulus of visible \nlight to be the same colors that we see. It might not even interpret the \nstimuli into anything that we humans would call the sensation of \"sight\" at \nall.\n\nWhich brings me back to the original point of discussion. Is gamma \nradiation or ultraviolet light or whatever black? Yes and no. The concept \nof color is an entirely human one. At BEST, it is an Earth concept. It is a \nresult of our specific line of evolution. If someone's eyes were to be \ntweaked slightly, then the entire color spectrum would move in such a \nmanner that Ultraviolet light would be the new red, and the wavelength that \nused to be blue would no longer be visible. Gamma radiation appears \ninvisible (and thus black in the absence of visible light) to us because \nour eyes cannot sense it. That doesn't mean it is insensible and, \ntherefore, necessarily black in all circumstances. It just means that is \nhow humans see (or more accurately; don't see) it.\n\nAnd, to answer the question of what a perfect vacuum would look like, it \nwouldn't look like anything. No ocular nerves would be able to pick up \nanything. Thus, from a human perspective, it would appear black, the \nabsence of stimulus. Even a creature with differently evolved ocular nerves \nwould be unable to receive any stimulus. Thus, it would still appear as \ntheir equivalent of the lack of stimulus.\n\nAnd there you have it, a discussion on color from a non-humancentric point \nof view.",

Infrared, ultraviolet, \ngamma, etc. radiation is not visible to us because it does not trigger rods \nor cones in our eyes, so yes, it appears black to us (if there is no \nvisible light being emitted or reflected), but it is not black. The colors \nwe see are combinations of different signals from rods and cones in our \neyes, and so, if infrared radiation has no effect on our rods or cones, it \ndoes not matter if it is there or not, it still does not appear as anything \nto us; we would only see whatever visible light is emitted/reflected.
