Whenever I am reading or \nrelaxing? She will always jumps on my lap and or somewhere near me and fall \nasleep. My cat is a lovable angel. Hell, she is more like a dog then a cat \ncause she is so damn docile and cuddly. She may of bitten me once or twice \nas a kitten but that is about it. She will even allow me to pet her when \nshe is eating, which is kind of funny cause here she is chomping on cat \nfood and trying to purr at the same time, but I don't do it that often \ncause I don't want her to end up choking on food.\ufeff",

I can even walk around for hours doing other stuff, and he is still \nthere! When I finally convince him to stay on the floor (or furniture) he \nSTALKS me. Everywhere I go, he is there. Im almost stepping on him like 100 \ntimes a day, and he WONT shut up. EVER! He is talking to me ALL the time. \nAnyone knows how to fix this without having to kill him or saw off his legs \nor something?\nI cant even take a shower by myself.

Cat's are ungrateful and selfish. Owning a cat \nis a thankless task. They are stupid animals that operate on instincts to \nbe fed and to survive instead of having any intelligence. They will happily \nbite and claw the hand that feeds them without giving a fuck.
