            "text": "Hey guys. I hope Im not out of place saying this. But if someone can \ncorrect me. What is the significance of shooting short films on such high \nend equipment. I completely understand quality but at what cost. Im looking \nat this more from a producers stand point. If I raised $5,000 to film a \nshort film I know a lot of people would want to go right away and rent or \nbuy a bunch of gear. They would make an amazing little film that would look \nbeautiful. But then all of their budget would be spent up. Why dont people \njust focus on managing their budget a little more and spend more towards \nthe marketing and actually have their film go somewhere past vimeo, \nfacebook or small indie film festival. I have a lot of respect for Film \nRiot but there smart and they can play with these toys because they know \nhow to market themselves using brand integration or way of creating sources \nof income to fund this equipment and videos so they dont pay out of pocket \nfor these items. ( I can only hope). People need to understand that \nmarketing value is so much more important than fancy cameras. If you can \nshoot on a canon 550D. I know its not as good quality but its cheaper than \na Scarlet, than me as a producer would rather invest my funds into a film I \nknow might go somewhere with filmmakers who need pretty equipment and don't \nhave the talent to film frugal. Thats what separates Hollywood from \nIndependent filmmakers. I know its an unfortunate world we live in but if \nyou want to get past the Independant status you have to think corporate and \nwhat will sell. Your audience doesnt care on wether this was shot on a dslr \nor cinematic camera. As long as it looks GOOD and is entertaining. Think of \nhow Spielberg and Cameron were making films in the early days without all \nthis stuff. \ufeff",

I love the way the Red footage looks, and i have a friend that \nhas a friend that for some reason just has a Red sitting around that's not \ngetting used that much, and said we can use it for free to shoot with if we \nwant, but i told him that i feel the Red is over kill, and we don't need \nit. I can shoot great videos with out it, plus the Red is heavy. We where \njust shooting a music video, and the 5d mark ii, or even a t2i dose great \njobs on music videos so i did not see any need to use the Red, but maybe \nfor a small film i would. Some times on bigger projects you want every edge \nyou can get. I'm just saying its a time to use Red, and its a time not too. \nJust cause the footage looks great and the Red cost a lot dose not mean its \nall ways the best tool for the job, but some times its is the best, and the \ngo to tool for the job.
