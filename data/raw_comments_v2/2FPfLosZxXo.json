One business \nfact I did not hear in your show:  Car manufacturers use dealers as storage \nfor inventory of cars.  When you want a model and equipment combination \nthey can transfer the car from another's inventory.  This purchase of \ninventory plus the land costs, plus the inventory taxes are certainly an \ninvestment that car dealers have made in their businesses and would want to \nprotect.  Did not hear the business side, only the 'picking on Tesla' side. \n When Tesla grows, they will have inventory in dealers like everyone else. \n Yes, it looks like the effort to squash them as a competitor and reduce \ntheir chance of getting a foothold.  \n   Your point that Tesla is outselling BMW and Mercedes looked a bit \nimprovisational, because you added no backup of facts or numbers. Later, \nyour woman commentator said Tesla had a waiting list and could not fulfill \norders, and the panel agreed.\n Third panelist from the left begins decrying 'crony capitalism' where \npeople protect their interests,then by the end of the show he reverses \nentirely and advocates for Mr. Musk of Tesla to do exactly the same thing \nand boast about his wealth and attack lawmakers and other opponents.  \n  60 minutes from CBS news once closed with a segment called \n\"point-counterpoint\". Two people, differing opinions and each person held \nto their opinion for the entire broadcast.  Then the audience can process \nthe information.\n  You have the makings of a good formula, but have your team come from a \npoint of view, hold a perspective that we can learn from, or be consistent \nwith measurable examples.  This would set you apart, and put you ahead.\ufeff",

You, me and if I am not wrong, millions of people love \nTesla and that is the only reason which matters.\n\nOf course these kind of politicians should be booted out, but it shouldn't \nbe by a single person. People would get pissed when they won't be allowed \nto buy a Tesla (and people are realizing that, let the Model 3 come, it \nwill be a different scenario altogether). To quote Elon Musk, \"People take \na lot of convincing to realize that electric cars are the future\", and we \nall believe in the future which he has envisioned.\n\nGo Elon, you are awesome.\nThanks for reading this, have  a good one :)  ",
