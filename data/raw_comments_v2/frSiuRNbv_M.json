Moto Guzzi is in the perfect position to \ncapture the resurgence of interest in cafe racer motorcycles, and yet, from \nthis video, I didn't get any sense that the company is even considering \nproduct development in that arena.  So many cafe racers are being built \nfrom the ground up by specialty shops here in the U.S. (and England, among \nothers), some of which end up costing $20K, $30K or more.  The only \nproduction bikes available here in the U.S. that cater to the cafe racer \nmarket are the V7 Racer, the Triumph Thruxton, and perhaps the BMW R9T.  So \nmany of us who are interested in this style of motorcycle aren't buying any \nof these models because they are underpowered (exception being the BMW). \n The market isn't asking for 200 HP cafe racers, but they are asking for \nsomething that is relatively light weight, 80 to 100 HP, air cooled, and \nsimple that captures the essence of those bikes from the `60s.  A company \nthat can produce something as stylish as the V7 Racer could certainly \ndeliver on the concept I've outlined.  How about it, Miguel?\ufeff",

Hideous \nfairings, rubbish handlebar furniture,stupid side panels,seat catches \netc.They really buggered the headstock and breather system on the later \nones, but no improvements where they mattered.WHO was responsible for all \nthat nonsense? This has been going on for 35 years,  I have given it at \nleast 25 years of thought. Engineering these, & Many other little faults \nout and achieving perfection, occasionally.\n Working for at least 10 years in the trade,in London, trying to cover the \nfactory`s arse.\n It was often embarrassing, especially with customers who had recently \nshelled out for a new one, that kept going wrong. (Cali`3, a disaster) A \nproper PDI might take 16 hours!\nNow we all know that a properly finished Mk l LM (or Cali ll ) style 850, \n950 or 1100, with the right modern upgraded parts but the classic lines \nthat we all fell in love with, back then, IS what the world wants. Given \nthat it is still the same old meat with different gravy, coming out of \nMandelo. If we never see another V50 clone, no one will care. They are shit!\n But a better `Ducati`or `Gilera` style single could be respectable\n I was really pleased to hear Miguel say all the right things about \nclassic, beautiful designs, that are timeless.Ones that look like the same \nman did both ends of the bike.\nGizza job, I know you`ve got one ! :)\ufeff",
