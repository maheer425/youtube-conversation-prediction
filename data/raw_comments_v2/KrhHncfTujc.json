It would react to the overburdon of weight \ninside the car w/ 2 big boys or when pushing thru the corners. That'd cause \nbody roll and compress the shocks so, you could also install a hidden \nbutton that allows the driver to change the baseline pressure point in the \nprocessor, to allow a more aggressive driving.
