It acts like a barrier and won't blister. \nAlso, before wearing the shoes out, put on your thickest socks, usually bed \nsocks, and put the shoes on - wear them around the house - it will stretch \nthem out naturally. Alternatively, you can get zip lock bags, fill with \nwater and place in shoe where they need to stretch, put in freezer. As the \nwater freezes it will expand, stretching a shoe just a bit :)",
