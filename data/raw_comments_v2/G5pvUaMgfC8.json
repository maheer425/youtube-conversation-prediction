            "text": "I am somewhat offended by what Mr. Pampanin has to say here for a couple of \nreasons. Though I myself do not identify as gay or lesbian, it has always \nbeen important to me to advocate for LGBTQ rights. I am a single, \nrelatively \"straight\" female from San Francisco. I say \u201crelatively \nstraight\u201d not because I am in denial of anything, but because I eschew \nlabels such as \u201cstraight\u201d and I live by my own belief that we all exist on \na sexual spectrum. No one is 100% \u2018gay\u2019 or 100% \u2018straight\u2019 but SO WHAT? We \nas a society are broken in that we feel the need to slap a label on \neverything in order to \u201cunderstand\u201d it, and thereby, I think, control it. \n I prefer not to be categorized nor controlled, but to just be. Therefore I \ncount myself lucky to have friends who are GOOD PEOPLE, regardless of their \nsexual orientation. I am a someone who has been fortunate enough to have \nlifelong friends that happen to identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans \nor queer. Some of them also identify as artists, musicians, lawyers and \nteachers. Go figure! This is life, and they are people -  not arm candy or \n\"tokens\" to me. For him to suggest that I or anyone else, is so easily \nswayed, so shallow and morally bereft that they are using human beings as \nstatus symbols or the next \u201cgot-to-have-gadget\u201d is reprehensible, offensive \nand more than a little na\u00efve. Sure, it could be argued that there \u201care \nthose people\u201d who are supposedly so weak-minded that they look to the media \nand magazines, etc. to guide them in their quest for identity, however, \nlet\u2019s be real, here. A TED Talk it does not make. I think the fact that Mr. \nP was able to garner an award and a speech out of it is fine, but he \nneedn't extrapolate this \u201ctrend\u201d into anything more than what it is: a slow \nnews day story blown WAY out of proportion. Having said this, I do not mean \nto minimize the underlying meaning of what I think Mr. P is trying to bring \nto light. I have no doubt there are in fact dim-witted, lost, twitter- \ntwatters out there who are nodding along to the advice of said media \nwithout a clue about what they are doing. They are like this generation\u2019s \nStepford Wives, mindlessly following the orders given to them by the last \n\u201cGotta Getta Gay Guy BF\u201d article in \u201cSeventeen\u201d magazine.  And the fall-out \nof this insipid behavior is not only embarrassing to watch and hear, it can \nbe painful and degrading to the very people begin targeted. However, I \nthink it\u2019s important to point out that they are the minority. I think it \ndoes everyone a disservice \u2013 straight and gay \u2013 to give this \u201chot new \ntrend\u201d any attention. With any luck it will die the death of parachute \npants and we can all go back to  living and enjoying our friends \u2013 gay or \nstraight. \n\nLastly, I just wanted to say to Mr. P and anyone else who has been hurt by \nthis discrimination \u2013 I understand and empathize. I may sound snide in \nsaying that, I assure you I say it with complete seriousness and love. It \nis no fun being reduced to an object, a stereo-type or a \u201cthing\u201d seen only \nto exist for the enjoyment and pleasure of others. Mr. Pampanin, on behalf \nof females everywhere - welcome to our world.\ufeff",

People who say he fulfills the stereotype himself, \nyou miss another point.

I think the first part of the presentation was very well done and \nthe second was less so, however the message was clear and the intention \nduring the second half was to be use some aspects of the GBF stereotype as \ncomedy.

The \nlegal battles are one thing but getting down to the details of WHY and HOW \nsomeone should like me as a minority is questionable... No one likes to be \nstereotyped or pigeon-holed, but no one is forcing any gay man to hang with \nbasic you-know-whats either. And as another commenter (+Rod Neville )put it \nwhen these men (and women) get older, they'll change.\n\nSorry for the long reply here, but it's coming from a place of disdain \nagainst many speeches/protests over minute issues. NOT because I think that \ntheir whiny (I love discussions), but because they repeatedly seem to \ncoddle gay/minority youth, in a way that keeps them from deciding some \ninteresting identity questions for themselves. It gives us (and them) \nsomething to bicker about before actually experiencing it. \nA gay man with any interest in actually living out 'his gayness' will \nquickly find that how his 'girlfriends' treat him is among the very last of \nhis obstacles in the gay dating community. This is why for me, it was worth \nnoting Mr. Pampanin's 'look' and it's relative popularity in the gay \ncommunity; in a sense, as easy as it is for someone like him to 'enjoy the \nfull spectrum of gay life', it's no wonder that this issue is the one which \nsticks out to him when he sees gay characters in the media.\n\nI'm glad he made this speech but I'd rather a talk that encourages people \nto navigate their identity wisely than one which tells other people what to \nnot be entertained by.

His \npresentation focuses on the younger generation that faces the GBF issue and \nto illustrate that the GBF stereotype, or the general gay male stereotype, \ndoesn't apply to every gay man.  The presentation was to stop people from \ncontinuing this stereotype, and paint gay men as individuals who are \ndifferent from one another.   Your remark about thinking you're supposed to \nbehave in his manner is a definite point of misunderstanding.  His message \nwas that you can behave however you like, have the mannerisms you wish and \nbe your own person outside of someone deciding what you should be like \nbased on your sexuality.  You're sexuality doesn't define you, and while \nsome people do fulfill the 'gay' stereotype his message was to define \nyourself outside of the forces of someone who would see you only as a set \nof stereotypes (The GBF). You should remember that as a minority support \nshould start from within the community, classifying him as a sad stereotype \nisn't supportive of people who have found themselves to be close to the \nstereotype.  Everyone is different and while you may not follow the \nstereotype, he does to some extent and I don't think that should be the \nfocus of his presentation.

I agree that the commercialization of the GBF is \nan issue, but only because it promotes one-sided relationships and the idea \nthat there is just one type of homosexual (the effeminate gay man who cares \nonly about you and your issues). Outside of this, I think it's pretty \nnormal for women and gay men to seek each other out as natural allies. \nWomen tend to be less judgmental and more open and accepting than straight \nmen and gay men offer a supportive masculine presence that lacks aggressive \nsexual energy (i.e. we're not trying to get in their pants all the time). \nThe important thing is to make sure your friendships are real friendships. \nAlso, a straight girl calling you and your boyfriend cute is not a problem. \nI call straight couples cute all the time. Some couples just are. Deal with \nit and move on.   \ufeff",

And not even as a \nperson but as a thing, a accessory they must have. They expect us to all \nlove and be in the know on fashion, which personally I have no clue what's \ntrendy and what looks hot, amongst other stereotypes, and that is not all \ngay men.\nSure some men really fit the stereotypes, but that doesn't change the fact \nthat as he said \"Person. Mark.\" They are a person regardless and shouldn't \nbe tokenized because they fit the GBF stereotypes.\nAnd while some people say it is easy to find who you are while maintaining \na relationship like that, they are really dreaming about how it really \naffects young people. Everything people say has a big impact and this is a \nbig influence on them.\n\nAt the standard level, having a GBF has become a status statement like \nsaying \"oh i'm not racist because I have black friends\". Having a GBF as a \ntoken does not make you any less homophobic. Whether you treat them as a \nperson equal to you or not does, or have some people lost sight of what \nequality really means. This tokenization goes against the whole idea behind \ngay rights and people are saying \"oh we can use it to gain rights, then be \nwho we are\". Well that's not the rights we want at all.
