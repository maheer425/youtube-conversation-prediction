Not that the reader is unsure \nwhether or not Mersualt committed the murder--to a discerning eye, it is \neven obvious that the murder was intentional; No,--the story renders the \nreader immobilized at condemning Mersault for his actions. The reader even \ngrows to admire him for his inner-strength, no matter what what happens \naround him, Mersault remains equiposed; to this end He is portrayed \nstatically, /ad hoc/ aloof. On top of that, you know that he killed a man \ninvolved in the murder of a good friend of his. Camus burdens the weight of \njudgement on the reader even more, when Mersault literally sleeps through \nhis trial--what is he going to do, anyway?--He can't explain that in \nprotecting his buddy from the *law,* dude got himself killed by the Arabian \nmafia!^1--He can't site his victim taunting him with the sunlight off the \nknife blade startling him and causing him to fire (hem-ha-hem, just \nprematurely) the gun--There is literally. Nothing. He can do. Lemon juice \nto open wound, when Mersault is brought up to the stand, the prosecutor \nattacks *his* morals for 'not mourning' his mother's death... Oh, the \nirony, that it is moral to condemn a man to a pitiless death for not \nappearing to mourn. (Subtly compounded accusation, as you may remember \npeople at the funeral showing up just to... be seen there. Really.)\ufeff",

I think a great \nauthor like Camus does not need to be bound by continental philosophy or \nliterary interpretations that rely on the historical accounts of what the \nauthor's work was about. Psychology now has become cognitive science. When \nCamus published the stranger Freud was barely in the ground. Of course our \nmodern interpretations of character's motivations can be more clinical, we \nhave clinical information. The author's intentions are not sacrosanct. \nWanting to read the text as existentialist/absurdist is fine, but great art \nhas a way of pointing at truths that are more tangible than non-positivist \nphilosophy can handle. I think ignoring the naive realist reading, \"Dude \nwas psycho,\" or \"Dude was cray cray,\" is doing a disservice to society's \nability to assess why people break norms. His desire to escape death \nindicates that he is not purely rational being, or he would not have done \nsomething that would risk death in the first place. ",

            "text": "Categorizing Meursault can be a bit difficult. At the end, most definitely, \nhe has embraced an absurd lifestyle:\n\n\"As if the blind rage had washed me clean, rid me of hope; for the first \ntime, in that night alive with signs and stars, I opened myself to the \ngentle indifference of the world. Finding it so much like myself - so like \na brother, really- I felt that I had been happy and that I was happy \nagain.\" (122-123)\n\nFaced with his own mortality, Meursault truly recognizes the depth of his \nmeaninglessness. He has long recognized the meainglessness of existence, \ngoing as far as to state that \" everybody knows life isn't worth living '\" \n(114), yet it is in certainity of death that this meaningless is resolved \nin a larger, universal context. He will have no impact, he will not be \nremembered, and this is the nature not just of his life, but of all things. \nThis is the thought which comforts and brings catharsis to Meursault who \nhas so long struggled with the futility of existence.\n\nHowever, I would contest that Meursault is not nihilist at the beginning of \nthe next. This is all tricky, though, as existentialism, existential \nnihilism (what we would be discussing in regards to Meursault), and \nabsurdism all share common trends. However, in the earlier segments of The \nStranger, Meursault is living in the existential void. He hasn't \nnecessarily accepted that life has no inherent meaning or value, though he \nrecognizes these as facets of existence. This fine difference between \nacceptance and recognition are significant, especially in the context of \nMeursault. He sees the pointlessness of life, yet he does not truly allow \nit to define him, rather, he struggles to exist as best he can with this \nknowledge, without the self-deception that everyone around him, from Marie \nto Raymond to the chaplain has, and without the resolution of this \nmeaningless that comes with nihilism or absurdism.\n\nAs well, it's interesting to note how valuable the elements of his life he \ninsisted to be meaningless are as the novel nears its conclusion:\n\n\"I said I had been looking at the stones in these walls for months . . . \nMaybe, at one time, way back, I had searched for a face in them. But the \nface I was looking for was as bright as the sun and the flame of desire - \nand it belonged to Marie.\"  (p. 119)\nSeveral times, in transport from the courtroom to the prison van, he talks \nabout the simplicity and happiness of his life when he could roam the \nstreets, go for a swim, etc.\nThe last few chapters of the book are littered with stories from and \nallusions to his Maman.\n\nDid he never love Marie, or did he simply dismiss the value of his emotions \ntowards Marie due to is inability to comprehend this love in a world he \nunderstood was inescapably meaningless? Why does he so frequntly reference \nhis Maman's thoughts/opinions now (and still use the intimate Maman in \nreference to her)? Why was he unable to recognize the value of these things \nprior to his imprisonment?\n\nTo reiterate, the answer is death. Meursaults existential crisis is \nassuaged by the threat of his execution which leads him to embrace the \nabsurdity of existence. This is not a shift from a nihilist perspective to \nan absurd one. Rather, although Meursault was never plagued with the \nexistential angst anticipated from the existential crisis, he has endured \nand escaped the void of meaning in which he lived throughout the novel.\n\nI hope this helped in some way, and remember, you can disagree! That is the \nbeauty of literature, I've only shared my opinions here.",
