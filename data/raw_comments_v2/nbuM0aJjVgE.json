However, I would like to \npoint out certain inaccuracies.Firstly, Aurangzeb was the great grandson of \nAkbar (Akbar-Salim-Shah jahan-Aurganzeb). Secondly, the Moghul empire was \nnot all that strong after Aurangzeb's son, Bahadur Shah 1. The Marathas \ncontrolled majority of India after Bahadur Shah's reign and some how, \nalthough the information is available, people have seen to have it \nneglected so well. The Moghuls were anything but tolerant of religions. \nBabur created the babri masjid on sacred Hindu soil and didnt even allow \nthe mosque to be used. Such selfish act. Then lets come to Akbar. Akbar was \nonly tolerant towards the end of his life after seeing the carnage that he \nhad produced. It is said that in the war he had with Maharana Pratap, the \nSacred thread worn over the shoulder of a Hindu amounted to over a ton when \nweighed from the dead soldiers. Aurangzeb was notorious of course but at \nleast he is known for that. However, I am not saying that Mr. Green has not \ndone a good job here. He has merely been misled by his \"scratching on the \nsurface\" research into the Mughal Empire. (no offence Mr. Green)\ufeff",

Being from Pakistan and having \nlearned the Mughal history by heart, I have one comment to make. The \nlineage of the Mughals goes something like this: Akbar of Ferghana, Humayun \n(his son), Akbar (Humayun's son), Jehangir (Akbar's son), Shah Jehan \n(Humayun's son) and Aurangzeb (Shah Jehan's son). By that order, calling \nAurangzeb, Akbar's grandson is a tiny mistake that you made. Furthermore, \nhearing very different pronunciations of the names of things so common in \nthe Urdu language was a little funny but you did a great job! :)\ufeff",
