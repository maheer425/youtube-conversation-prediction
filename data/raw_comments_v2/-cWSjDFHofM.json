            "text": "He's an underground rapper. Do you guys think he's going to censor himself \nin something he is releasing personally and have no kpop idol hooked on it? \nPeople who are in outrage need to understand that there are other scenes of \nmusic in k-music other than the censored kpop. For example, look at all the \nunderground artists who are in kpop groups now, compare their mix tapes to \nwhat they release now. They are so much tamer. (Zico, Kyung, etc.) I really \nhate people who say \"I like Korean music because it's so much nicer than \ntrashy American music.\" Those people have really closed-off POVs because \nthey don't see the American scene past top 40. There are plenty of other \nartists that are not trashy or going the easy route to sell music. There \nare rappers who write deep lyrics, just like in Korea, they just aren't in \nthe front lines of being famous because people like listening to the \n\"trashy rap\". They see money, they continue to write trash. Hop off the \nKorea is so pure and awesome, music so deep not trashy, mindset and explore \ntheir music and any music with an open mind. Some you hate, some you like, \nbut don't generalize a scene.\n\nAlso I'm a big supporter of feminism, but I'm not jumping up to arms \nbecause he called some girl a \"bitch\" or a \"ho\" because honestly, I'd call \npeople that if they betrayed me in some way. He isn't going into the whole \n\"Let me berate and look down upon women.\" like you say he is because if he \nwas his lyrics would be \"Let me jump into the club, all them bitches be on \nmy d'\" He is generalizing women at the club for wanting him and hints at \nthem being sluts and etc. In this rap, he is venting anger and frustration. \nHe was cheated on, he's mad. It's a normal reaction to betrayal of someone \nyou believed loved you. Would you be happy if someone betrayed you? You'd \nbe mad or sad, depending on your relationship with said person. If he \nwasn't going to use the English words that pop out so much since we \nunderstand English and not Korean off the bat, he would've used the Korean \nequivalents and I don't doubt people would be up in arms as much. Korea \nuses curse words just as much as the rest of the world. It's not like he \nplastered the son in \"F' you's\" and \"bitch and ho\". (Sometimes that's what \nruins Eminem's raps for me. The context is good but then there's too many \nf'bombs everywhere and cursing that it ruins the song and you can't take \nhim seriously, but that's because of amount, not because of the words.\n\nNo one got upset at GD for using \"geu saekki\" (not that harsh of a curse \nword, but in the context it was derogatory) towards a guy that had the girl \nthat he liked in the song. If idk BTS came out with something, calling out \nthe people who looked down on them, and it had curse words, fans would step \nup and say \"Wow, so edgy. They aren't afraid to be \"real\"\" (Oh wait, they \ndid release multiple tracks like thisand the fan response was as i said.) \nJump off the high horse, and don't compare these people to your moral \nstandards. Just because you don't curse, doesn't mean they don't have to. \nJust because you want to them not to curse because they are public figure, \ndoesn't mean they have to, especially people who are not selling themselves \nas idols to the youth of today. They are human beings, with feelings that \nthey want to express in their own words. Don't look down on their feelings \nor their work just because you don't like them. It's like me going up to \nsomething you made, made assumptions about you, and degraded you. \ufeff",
