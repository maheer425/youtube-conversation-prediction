It's unhealthy to be so wrapped up in your own \ndesires and not consider the wants and needs of others. \n\nAlso, if you communicate, you won't fight half as much. Bickering over \nthings like this video is fine so long as you move past it quickly, \nfighting is not a normal part of a relationship nor is resentment after \ngetting to completely know someone, if you resent them in the end, then \nthere were things left unsaid that should of been discussed or you didn't \nknow the real them before jumping into their lives completely. But people \nare both too stubborn or too embarrassed to get that close to someone and \nsay how they feel if they're jealous, sad or upset. It's something everyone \nshould work on. Even if it's over something stupid, an adjusted person can \nget past it, and understand that we all get mad at stupid things and that's \nok.\n\nFor the record, I don't believe in the one. My boyfriend and I know there \nis someone who may fit us better. Relationships are about working on \nbecoming the best person you can be and vice versa for your partner. You \nfind someone who shares similar interests, thought patterns and even with \nthe differences is willing to discuss it like adults or respect your \nopinion if there are no facts to back either side up. There is ALWAYS \nsomeone better out there. There is no perfect person. The person will \nbecome perfect to you through hard work and communication. But you do have \nto find someone you click well with and whose particular idiosyncrasies \ndon't drive you up the wall, or maybe the person is willing to work on \nthem.
