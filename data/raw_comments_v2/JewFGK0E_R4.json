Later, when I was like \n14, I had done my research and knew mostly everything I needed to know, and \nevery time after that when my mom would bring the topic up, I'd just tell \nher I know already and she doesn't have to bother explaining anything to \nme.

This isn't so much about sex, but I thought \nthat women didn't have nipples. I thought that was a guy thing, and when I \nenvisioned a girl's chest, I saw breasts with no nipples.\n\nI also had no idea what masturbation was, despite my friends knowing and \ntalking about it. I played along, but secretly, I was like \"What the hell \nis that?\"\n\nMy misconceptions were corrected when I found a certain file on my \ncomputer. The computer was passed down to me from one of my brothers I \nthink, and well... That file was all I needed to understand most of how sex \nworks.\n\nI wasn't really given the sex talk unless health class counts. I knew about \nsexual intercourse and its affiliations long before that health class, \nthough. In this day and age, really young kids know what sex is. I'm not \nsaying that's a good thing - it's not, it's kind of like a deprivation of \ninnocence. I think that having the sex talk with kids - even if they \nalready know what it pertains to - is important because today's kids know \nwhat it is, but they don't know the sacredness of it, and they don't \nnecessarily know what precautions to take when attempting it.\n\nI had to discover gay sex all on my own, in my teenage years. *coughs* *gay \nporn*\n\nI really wish students were educated on gay sex in health class.
