One thing I think is missing is that the \nhero returns with the knowledge or treasure which (and here's the important \nbit which I think is left out) benefits his community or culture or mankind \nin general. Yes, it is a story of self-growth that we can all relate to, \nbut the hero's journey also serves a higher purpose. I could go on & on \nabout this topic, but I'll spare everyone the boredom...only to say that \nBuffy the Vampire Slayer is very closely patterned on the archetypal \nwarrior hero.
