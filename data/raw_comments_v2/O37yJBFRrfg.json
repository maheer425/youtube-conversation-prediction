But I didn't say Biha\u0107 was the only place in \nBosnia connected to Croatia. With Biha\u0107 I meant a bigger piece of western \nBosnia. I forgot Biha\u0107 was that close to the Croatian border :P.  I \nshould've known, cause I've been pretty close to that area. I still made a \nmistake with how big that piece of Croatian Bosnia was. However, the core \nof medieval Croatia would still only be a bit more east of Biha\u0107. I would \nsay between Bosanska Krupa and Prijedor. The map you showed was more or \nless Croatia at its biggest extent. This is why Bosnia is not all that \nimportant to Croatia. Only the west. Places like Br\u010dko, Sarajevo and Tuzla \nwere not that important. Even if Vrhbosna was founded by Croatians (you \nhave a (short) reliable article?). \nAbout Duvno/Tomislavgrad. Altough there's no clear definition, I wouldn't \nsay this is a town in Hercegovina. My personal definition of \nHercegovina: The Drainage basins of the Neretva and the Trebi\u0161njica. At \nleast I wouldn't say Duvno/Tomislavgrad is deep (like you say) in \nHercegovina. You could say that one part of Hercegovina had been important \nto Croatia (west) whereas another part barely had any importance \n(east). The eastern parts (around Trebinje) weren't that important to \nCroatia.\nI also have to point out one of your sentences:\n\"A small part of Bosnia was independent for a short time before the \nOttomans conquered it.''\nI do not completely agree with this. It was not that small. The last 150 \nyears of its existence it covered much of current Bosnia. The Bosnian \nKingdom also existed for a few centuries. I wouldn't call it ''short \ntime''. \nI do agree with your opinion about ultranationalists. I'm a bit a \nnationalist myself. I have my ideas about how some borders should be (based \non history and the demographics (and its history)), but they never go that \nfar as these people and I'm still in favor of peaceful cooperation between \npeoples. These ultranationalists never consider looking it from another \npoint of view.\nAbout the years of suffering from Serb ultranationalism. So this actually \nmeans the 35 years of Serb ultranationalism in Kosovo weren't 35 years. The \nAlbanians weren't that mistreated just after Tito's dead (first years) and \nKosovo had already gained its ''independence'' in 2008,. So it would be \nmore reasonable to say it was like 15 years.\nAbout that question of yours. I think (I unfortunately don't know much \nabout them gaining independence in 2008) Serbia couldn't do much against \nNATO intervention. NATO was stronger. It would be a lost case. \nBack to the beginning of your comment. You're welcome ;). I never do stuff \nlike that in my comments. I only do it when they really pissed me off. When \nthey're asking for it. But then I'm still trying not to do it. I respect \npeople as long as they respect me. I had lots of discussions with for \nexample Albanians. They also do stuff like that. However, there's one thing \nthey've never done to me on YouTube. And a few Americans did it. They gave \nme some deaththreats. They are probably just bluffing, cause they were \npissed, but it looks like Albanian nationalists deserve more respect than \nAmerican nationalists. ",

Many people insulted and attacked me verbally when I \ntried to explain them some things about Croatia and Serbia. That's why I \nthank you for your kindness and I respect that.\n\nNow back to the main stuff.\nBosnia was the core of Croatian history alright. You've missed a couple of \nhundred years if you think that the area around Biha\u0107 is the only area \nconnected to Croatia. \nThis is all going to sound like \"things which only a Croatian dude would \nsay\", but these things I'm going to say to you are legit and 100% true. I'm \nnot a liar, I only deal with true facts from Internatonal history \norganizations (Wikipedia isn't too trustworthy).\n\nThe first independend Croatian state was established in the 800's and it \nwas consisted of Red Croatia (a wide area around todays Zagreb), Dalmatia \n(85% of todays Croatian Dalmatia, together with Dubrovnik), Slavonia \n(without Srijem) and a big part of Bosnia (together with Herzegowina even \nthough Herc. as a region didn't exist in that time).\nIn 925 the first Croatian kingdom was established with King Tomislav \ncrowned in Duvno (croatian Duvanjsko Polje), today Tomislavgrad. Duvno is \ndeep in Herzegowina today and in that time, almost whole Bosnia was \nCroatian.\nMap of Croatia in 925: \nhttp://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kralj_Tomislav#/media/File:Tomislavova_Hrvatska.jpg\n\nBosnia was under Croatia for almost 600 years since the arrival of Croats \nin the 7th century. Croatia completely lost Bosnia when the Ottomans \nstarted conquering the whole Eastern and Southeastern Europe in the 15th \ncentury. (A small part of Bosnia was independent for a short time before \nthe Ottomans conquered it).\n\nBelieve it or not, Sarajevo was first a Croatian city called Vrhbosna. When \nthe Ottomans demolished that city, they established their own city on the \narea of Vrhbosna and called it Sarajevo in the 16th century.\n\nBosnia is related to Croatia more than any other country (except for the \nTurks because of Islam etc.)\n\nToday, Bosnia doesn't belong to Croatia and Croatia doesn't claim Bosnia as \na part of Croatia because it's a totally different situation and time today \nthan back then.\n\nThe ultranationalist and extreme nationalist are in minority in Croatia, \nBosnia and Serbia and they all are a bunch of uninformed people with a \ncabbage instead of a brain.\n\nBy ''40 years of Serb ultranationalism'', I meant the time from the death \nof Tito in 1980. (35 years from now, not 40, sorry for that). Even though \nTito was \"glorious\" back in that time, he was indeed the only one who could \nhold the whole Yugoslavia as one. When he died, the Serbian \nultranationalist started overtaking the country because they were the \nmajority in the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (all 6 communist parties \nin one League) while Croats and Slovenians preffered a more federal type of \nYugoslavia (which was rejected by the Serbs). \n\n\nFor the '90% of Albanians in Kosovo' thing, I must admit that you're right. \nI haven't thought about it that way. But one question remains. I know that \nit was different back then in the 90's, but why didn't Serbia intervene \nmilitarily in 2008? The only answer I get in my head is that it would start \nan another war, but not between Serbia and the Kosovars, but between Serbia \nand Albania.",

I think there is not that much difference other \nthan religion. There used to be Croatians, Serbians and Bosnians in \nhistory with their own lands, but it's not that simple. I don't know \nexactly how to explain, but the fact is, that there is no real boundary \nbetween you people other than your religion. History is too messed up to \ngive all Croatians one Croat history without the Serbs and Bosnians. I \nthink a Croat from Dubrovnik shares a lot more (history, genetics and \nsuch) with a Serb from Trebinje than with another Croat from for example \nSplit. A Croat from Mostar shares a lot more (history) with a Bosniak from \nMostar than with a Croat from for example Dubrovnik. The thing I want to \nmake clear is that Serbo-Croats in the former Yugoslavia define themselves \nwith religion, but in some cases, that's actually the only difference!\nThere are also people who say Bosnia belongs to Croatia. I once saw a Croat \nwith a tattoo of Greater Croatia (roughly Croatia with Bosnia). These are \nextreme nationalists, but there are always people with these kinds of \nextreme nationalistic ideas.\nI was wondering what you meant by ''40 years of Serb ultranationalism''. \nWhich years. Did you include the years of the Yugoslav Kingdom? It can't be \nthe years of communist Yugoslavia.\nFurther on I also want you to know that the percentage of 90% Albanians in \nKosovo mean nothing to me. They gained this number after their \n''independence''. About 150 years before this ''independence'' Serbs were \n(if you look at the demographic history of Kosovo) probably the majority. \nYou might say Albanians suffered, but there number dramatically increased \nthe last 300 years. And the remained Serbs certainly suffered after \nthe ''independence''. A hated minority. Dicrimination and probably \nmurdering as a result. There was also many heritage destroyed.

But you don't see \npeople screaming \"Bosnia is Croatia\", do you? \nI don't think that you can call 40 years of Serbian ultranationalism over \nAlbanians \"nationalism for a few years\". \nEver since Tito died, every single ex-yugoslavian country except for Serbia \nsuffered because of the \"Greater Serbia ideology\". \nI could explain everything to you how, what and why all this happened but \nit would take too much time to write and explain.\nThe point i tried to make is- 90% of Kosovo right now are Albanians. The \ncountry is practically an illegal state, but I don't think that you can \ncall the massacre in Kosovar Mitrovica \"Serbian suffering\" because they did \nthe massacre, not Kosovars. Thats the reason why Kosovo will probably sue \nSerbia for genocide. \nCheck wikipedia and read about Ovcara massacre, Borovo Selo, Srebrenica \nmassacre etc. \nLive and let live.",

Do you even listen to yourself?\nYou're obviously living in a serbian propaganda with 0 knowledge of your \nown history or the history of surrounding countries.\nThis is the last time i'm explaining things to you and I won't reply \nanymore on your replies (you're not older than 15 for sure). \n1st- Not over one million, not one million, not 700,000, not 100,000.\nIn the Jasenovac concentration camp were ~85,000 people killed by the Nazis \nand Ustashe. That's the only black mark in Croatian history and Croatia is \nwell aware of that massacre. Even though that massacre was a thing of the \nUstashe (which were mainly Croats), Croatia mourns over the victims of \nJasenovac.\nDon't try to write untrue stuff about the victims because it's already \nstated by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre and United States Holocaust Memorial \nMuseum that Serbs are trying to enlarge (with untrue facts) the guilt of \nCroats because of the Jasenovac massacre.\nYes, the Ustashe were MAINLY Croats, but in the Jasenovac massacre were \neven the Serbian Chetniks involved. What can you say about that?\n\n2nd- 80% of Croats were against the Ustashe ultranationalist group. \nCroats were not the ones who killed Serbs, Jews, Croats etc.\nUstashe and Nazis killed them.\nNot Croats.\nUstashe and Nazis.\nGet it now?\n\nIt's a pitty that Serbia has to write, tell and say untrue things about \nCroatia just to cover the massacres and bad things they did in the past 25 \nyears. \nLet me tell you one interesting fact. If you think that Serbia is so \nglorious, why does Serbia lose 10,000 - 30 000 square kilometers of land \nevery 10 years? (Montenegro, Kosovo)\nSerbia is rapidly dissoluting because of all the bad things they did in the \nhistory and it's just a mather of time when will Vojvodina try to be \nindependent from Serbia just like Montenegro and Kosovo.\n\nThink about that.
