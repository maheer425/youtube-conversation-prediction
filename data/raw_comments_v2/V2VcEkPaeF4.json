By the time of Sulla and Marius the gap between \nrich and poor had reached huge polarities and the wealth of the republic \nwas concerntrated in the hands of a few rich men, these men themselves were \nbecoming an oligarchy. A few powerful senators were pretty much untouchable \nby the law, running roughshot over the legislation and running the republic \nas a personal money making venture. They were seizing wealth and lands from \npoor Romans and taking it for themselves, failing to gove soldiers promised \nlands as payment for service, instead keeping it for themselves.\n\nThe empire was brought about largely by Caesar who was a man of the people \nand rose on a popularist platform of protecting the citizens rights against \nthe greed of the senate and redistributing wealth. He wasn't the first to \ntry it, but the first with an army. Octavian followed this model, and \nemperors kept power by popularity with the masses and were seen by the \nmasses as protector of their rights and interests in senate. The most \nsuccessful emperors were the ones who enjoyed popular support by keeping \nsenate greed and exploitation down.\ufeff",
