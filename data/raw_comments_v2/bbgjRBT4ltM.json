That \nKoenigsegg's fans look a little dinky to be handling high volumes of air, \nthough, but I don't know much about high-performance fan tech :P\n\nAnyway, the region of space right under the front valences of standard road \ncars can generates enormous air pressures at high speed. If you pop open \nthe front hood of a Koenigsegg you see massive air ducting that is guiding \nair taken from under the front valence. Air is piped from the high-pressure \narea under the valence to those straked outflow ducts in front of the \nwindshield, above the front tires: more front downforce for the car to work \nwith.",

I don't \nunderstand the stupid loyalty some of you have towards cars that YOU WILL \nNEVER OWN built by manufacturers that could care less about your broke \nasses. The Venom is it's own car in it's own right with it's own VIN and it \njust so happens that the motherfucker is fast as shit. Get over it.",

This is \nsomething I wouldn't have noted otherwise if I didn't see your post which \ntruly opens my eyes to how different these cars with similar horse power \ntruly are.",
