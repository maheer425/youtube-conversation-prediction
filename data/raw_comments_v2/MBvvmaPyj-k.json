Reliability\n^Notice something here? Outside of experience, say I'm hiring you for a \nwelding position I would of course want you to be a welder, its your \nmentality and work ethic thats more important than anything after \nexperience. When an employer pops the question \"What makes you special\" \nrehearse and rehearse again, and say it fast:\nI have excellent work ethic, and respectful, reliable, and responsible, and \nam passionate about making a good impression about myself. If I ever need \nto look for another job I want you to be able to vouch for my ethics and \nemploy-ability with no if and or buts about who I am.\"\nUse words like \"Will, am, absolutely, and affirmative\" and never have an \nounce of doubt in yourself.\n\n-Of course you can simplify it, but boasting confidence and charisma will \ncertainly help. Say it with good pace but dont sound like a sped up \nrecorder. And if the employer asks if you have any questions for he/she, \nthe answer is \"When do I begin?\" If you set yourself up correctly then that \nwill be an appropriate response. Also, keep your poker face.\ufeff",

I had to learn some \nEnglish.\nSo you are a mechanical engineer.....why don't you have C driving license? \nNow I got B+E and C+E driving license.\nSo you are an engineer and understand English.....why you were not in the \nArmy? What I am going to do with you if the Army will call you? Now I am a \nreservist.\nOther stupid quotes:\n- you don't have a car. It was an office job...\n- Give me 8000$ and the job is yours!\n- Come to my house and paint it and I will think about this job.\n- how about a date? We were both dudes in the interview :P\n\nAt the 31st interview I had enough and I obtain the job.\nI wasn't honest!\nIt was something like this:\nQ: Do you know how to make this......?\nA: Me? I can be your teacher!\nI had no idea what was that.\n\n15 years later I am the one making the interviews and I still remember the \nassholes I had to please in the interviews with naive answers to stupid \nquestions.\ufeff",

Because both ways can be a lie \nbecause I may say something now but when it's moment of truth it might be \ntougher than I thought would be applying my skills here.\n\nInterview: you have job expirience?\n\nMe: no, because when I was younger I thought focusing more on my studies is \nmore important than job expirience, because i thought I would be hire \nbecause of education and not experience. Also my college didn't told me the \nexistence of internship until I was finishing my last semester. But if I \nwork at Burger King for few months, would that help as expirience as \nprogrammer? Because all programming jobs ask expirience and I don't have \nany since I must have expirience to gain expirience, which it's silly for \nme, even for an entry level position, even a nooby position needs at least \n3 years expirience. To be sincere if you hire a none expirience I'll work \nlike you want me to work and never go against your working believe cuz I'm \nused to my expiriences. \n\nInterview: what do you expect from us?\n\nMe: besides money so I won't be homeless?
