My comment was simply to address the many \npeople who have no respect even for the good aspects of law \nenforcement...the good cops. My mom and dad were both detectives and never \nonce took a bribe or snatched drug money; they always said \"You compromise \nonce, take a single dollar, you lose all legitimacy.\" My dad worked with \nguys just like detective Troopo who would've put a bullet in the back of \nany drug dealers head, took their money and spent their weekend down at the \nshore where they had all their money buried in bundles. I'm not going to \nget into a discussion at the moment on the drug war or the specifics of my \nidealogical views but I just wanted to clarify that i'm placing emphasis on \nthe importance of characters like Richie Roberts...not to sound corny but \nhim and my father symbolized the purity of justice in it's entirety...that \nthough many men and women give into vices and eventually corrupt there will \nalways be those that hold true to their principles.

I'm not accusing the \npolice of specific things, but I've gathered enough about human nature to \nknow that not even the people claiming to be the good guys are good most of \nthe time. that one cop(Russel crowe) is about the only good guy in the \nwhole fucking movie. also, ideologically i simply disagree with the war on \ndrugs. It's the legislation that makes drugs so profitable - if you didn't \nhave to be shady in order to get cocaine, the people who sold it would'nt \nbe shady either, and they also wouldn't make so much money and therefore be \nas cutthroat as frank was. I understand your position though, i just think \nyou need to look at it from all sides. although if you HAD to choose a \nside, i suppose the police would be your best bet.",
