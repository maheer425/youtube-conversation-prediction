If \nyou don't want to count the Suez canal, still they're BARELY connected then \nand I don't think it's worth considering it part of Eurasia. Same goes for \nnorth and south america. As for Australia, since it's so far away from \nEurasia and The Americas I think it's fair to consider it a continent, \nalthough I think the continent should be considered Oceania, although \nOceania, is considered a region, I think it should be considered a \ncontinent. I think that Oceania should also include all of Indonesia, the \neast island of Malaysia and the Philippines as they are all a bunch of \nislands and seem to fit in the continent of Oceania, as all are in the same \nocean.
