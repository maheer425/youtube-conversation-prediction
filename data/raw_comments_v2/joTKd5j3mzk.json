Look at it \nagain, please The only reason why the tax collector could get his pint \nwithout any delay was that nobody diminished his speed, since noone cared \nabout him. On the contrary, Higgs was continuously stopped by the \nscientists, but none of them gave him anything (a book, for instance) that \nwould increase his mass. My obvious conclusion was  that the key was the \nspeed. .\n          No bossom ''gives'' any mass to the particles that interact with \nthem. The only explanation I could figure out why some particles acquire \nmass by traveling throug the Higgs Field (which, I agree, is everywhere) is \nthat 'e' turns into 'm'.\n          I didn't quite undestand your expression ''the net energy doesn't \nchange only the form of the energy changes''. As far as I know, mass is a \nform of energy. A 'state' of it.\n\n(English, as you may have noticed, is not my language.

Without the Higgs field, all \nparticles would be without mass and move at the speed of light.  With the \nHiggs field, some particles gain rest mass and slow down, others don't (all \nparticles have energy mass).    I'm not entirely sure E=MC^2 is the best \nway to think about it because Quantum Mechanics can do strange things, like \ntravel backwards in time, or, apparently pull extra energy out of thin air \nand then return it a billionth of a second later.  \n\nAlso, because the Higgs field is everywhere, the mass is always there, from \na practical point of view.  The Higgs field doesn't come and go, only the \nBoson.   Now, in a quantum sense, the mass might come and go with \ninteractions with the Higgs Boson - I don't really know, but it would \naverage out over time to be consistent. - if that makes any sense.\n\nSo, re-reading what you wrote, on the quantum level, it's possible that a \nparticle's mass is converted from energy to rest mass by interaction with \nthe Higgs Boson/Higgs field, but the net energy doesn't change only the \nform of the energy changes.

No, the equation also works to be E^2=(MC^2)^2 + (pc)^2 where p = \nrelativistic mass of the photon and c is the speed of light.  The first \npart of the equation is zero because mass at rest (m) is zero.  The second \npart (or specifically pc - or pv in normal terms) is momentum.

You can always find reference frames where certain \nmassive objects are at rest or other frames where they are moving.

It's a strange board, but I like the \nFeynman analogy all the same cause that's kind of how they figured this \nstuff out - they studied the stuff that came out of particle \naccelerators.   They measured how particles behaved and they learned and \ndesigned the model from watching the behavior.\n\nThat's how they figured out anti-matter.  They saw a particle that behaved \njust like a proton but it had the charge of an electron, and after seeing \nit enough times, they called it an anti-proton and the tests kept \nconfirming it.\n\nBut I don't think what Feynman meant was that particles correspond to \npieces on a chess board, what he meant was that studying how particles \nbehave is like learning chess by watching it being played.\n\nIn some ways, Quantum Physics is predictable, like, they can predict how \nlong it takes for an unstable particle to decay or they can predict what \nwill happen when a proton comes near another proton (they will repel).
