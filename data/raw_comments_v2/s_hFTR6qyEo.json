Surely I'm forgetting other instances but you get the idea. I \nthink the intended conclusion is that uninhibited capitalism, void of \nregulation and ethics, ultimately produces a lot of blood, suffering, and \nprimarily victimizes those who knowingly engage in the risks. His son is \nobviously unaware of the risks and the innocence of the miners killed could \nbe contested, but again that's another discussion. \nI'm actually surprised the crazy right wing conservatives of America did \nnot attack this story but I guess most of them are too slow to understand \nthe themes and motifs being presented here about the dangers of truly free \nmarkets.",
