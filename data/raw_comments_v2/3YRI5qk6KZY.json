Since his days as a United States Senator, \nPresident Obama has embraced the principle of net neutrality. As the \nPresident recently noted, his campaign for the White House was empowered by \nan open Internet; it allowed millions of supporters to interact with the \nPresident and each other in unprecedented fashion. That experience helped \ngive rise to the creation of this very platform -- the We The People \nwebsite -- where Americans can express their opinions on any topic and \nreceive a response from the White House. Rights of free speech, and the \nfree flow of information, are central to our society and economy -- and the \nprinciple of net neutrality gives every American an equal and meaningful \nopportunity to participate in both. Indeed, an open Internet is an engine \nfor freedom around the world.\nPreserving an open Internet is vital not just to the free flow of \ninformation, but also to promoting innovation and economic productivity. \nBecause of its openness, the Internet has allowed entrepreneurs -- with \njust a small amount of seed money or a modest grant -- to take their \ninnovative ideas from the garage or the dorm room to every corner of the \nEarth, building companies, creating jobs, improving vital services, and \nfostering even more innovation along the way.\nAbsent net neutrality, the Internet could turn into a high-priced private \ntoll road that would be inaccessible to the next generation of visionaries. \nThe resulting decline in the development of advanced online apps and \nservices would dampen demand for broadband and ultimately discourage \ninvestment in broadband infrastructure. An open Internet removes barriers \nto investment worldwide.\nA wide spectrum of stakeholders and policymakers recognize the importance \nof these principles. In the wake of last month's court decision, it was \nencouraging to hear major broadband providers assert their commitment to an \nopen Internet.\nIt was also encouraging to see Federal Communications Commission Chairman \nTom Wheeler, whom the President appointed to that post last year, reaffirm \nhis commitment to a free and open Internet and pledge to use the authority \ngranted by Congress to maintain a free and open Internet. The White House \nstrongly supports the FCC and Chairman Wheeler in this effort.\nThe petition asked that the President direct the FCC to reclassify Internet \nservice providers as \"common carriers\" which, if upheld, would give the FCC \na distinct set of regulatory tools to promote net neutrality. The FCC is an \nindependent agency. Chairman Wheeler has publicly pledged to use the full \nauthority granted by Congress to maintain a robust, free and open Internet \n-- a principle that this White House vigorously supports.\nGene Sperling is Director of the National Economic Council and Assistant to \nthe President for Economic Policy. Todd Park is the United States Chief \nTechnology Officer and Assistant to the President.\"\n\nWTF DOES THIS MEAN? We won???\ufeff",

This is not a cable company setup where \nthey simply buy the easement rights to the property you live on to \nestablish a monopoly. The internet is computers talking to each other, and \nthey will probably always have the capability to talk to each other ONE AT \nA TIME, from one computer to another. But they are establishing a chokehold \non the delivery system for all content at it's source, or rather, they will \ncontrol the comm lines effectively. So yeah. But you know, perhaps once \nquantum computing takes off, speed will in fact no longer be an issue. We \nshould keep a close eye on THAT, because they are probably already \npreparing for this eventuality.  Remember, like other technologies, the \ntechnology drives the access. We arrived at this point where the people \nFINALLY have a voice because of technology. That trend will in all \nlikelihood continue. They are just scrambling to maintain the old paradigm, \nbut it's all about to explode and the old paradigm, wounded as it now is, \nwill no longer work. It just won't. Civil wars will not stop it. However, \ntechnology suppression will. That is where the grass roots opposition \nshould put the most pressure. We're actually almost there, stay focused.\ufeff",
