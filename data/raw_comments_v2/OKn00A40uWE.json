            "text": "+Blk Dominican You have such reverence for Miss Crawford, Bill. It's nice \nto see her fans still as loyal and loving as ever.\nWhen Joan Crawford married Alfred Nu Steele in 1955, Pepsi-Cola was on the \nverge of going international, after a very successful domestic run under \nSteele. Steele could do no wrong, as far as Pepsi was concerned.\nUpon marrying, Crawford became a roving ambassador-in-glamor for the soft \ndrink company, opening bottling plants, promoting the product wherever and \nhowever she could ( even product placement spots within her later films - \nall hits with the \"Pepsi generation\") and essentially providing Pepsi with \nmore press than advertizing dollars could have garnered. Wherever she went, \nPepsi-Cola followed - and so did the press. Lots of it. When Al Steele \npassed on from a coronary in 1959, just shy of the couple's fourth wedding \nanniversary, his personal financial affairs were somewhat messy, though not \nas it relates to his employer. Steele did, in fact, take out loans to both \nfinance the reconstruction of the East 69th Street duplex penthouse and for \nliving expenses during the process. One of the people from whom he borrowed \nmoney was Joan, who liquidated her savings and borrowed against her \ninsurance policies and took his stock options/real property stock and other \nassets as collateral. The loan he had taken from Pepsi had been repaid by \nthe time of his death. He was on salary, and Joan still held substantial \nstock in lieu of the loans she had made to Steele. ( His will was not \nsettled in New York probate until 1966. ) What Pepsi-Cola was trying to do \nwas reclaim the penthouse as company property, for there had been rumblings \nfrom shareholders about the famous couple's high-flying lifestyle and trips \nabroad to promote the product. Because Pepsi had provided Steele with loans \nsolely for the purpose ( or so they asserted ) of Mr. & Mrs. Steele using \nthe penthouse to woo investors and dazzle clients, i.e. strictly business, \nit was reasoned by the Pepsi Board that, after Steele's death and \nCrawford's soon-to-be-disenfranchisement from the company ( or so they \nasserted . . . . ), the East 69th duplex penthouse should revert to the \ncompany. The value of the home was around $500,000.00, an enormous sum in \n1959, even by Manhattan standards. There was no \"ample debt\" to be repaid, \nas per the quite dramatic scene above. What Pepsi wanted was to both kick \nJoan Crawford off the Board and out-of the apartment. Joan knew she had to \nwork fast. She called Louella Parsons, one of the top Hollywood gossip \ncolumnists of the time, and gave her the exclusive that she was broke ( \nwhich, as far as Steele's legacy was concerned, was true, for he had had no \nassets except for the ones Crawford was holding as collateral ) and that \nPepsi-Cola wanted to toss her into the street . . . . Uh-oh. Bad press. Bad \npress. Well, welcome back, Miss Crawford, on a $50,000.00 annual salary \nplus $40,000.00 expense account, a $12,000.00 annual secretarial account \nand continued stock options ( Bullseye. ) Joan Crawford retained her \nposition until she was involuntarily retired ( upon her official 65th \nbirthday ) in 1973 by Douglas Kendall ( a man whom Crawford often referred \nto as Fang. ) One wonders, though, where were the fabled jewel collection \nand real estate and other tid-bits of accumulated wealth Joan Crawford had \napparently amassed during all the cries of poverty. She was savvy. Savvy \nenough to know when NOT to divulge. The movie clip may be entertaining, yet \nit doesn't do justice, I think, to the truly wonderful work Miss Crawford \nwas able to do for Pepsi-Cola. She was a working star - not merely an \nextortionist. In closing, let me tell you a great story : When Alfred and \nJoan were looking for a pad in NYC, they applied to an exclusive Manhattan \nco-op but were rejected. Ever the queen, and never to let anybody else \ntrump her, Joan had a very large Pepsi-Cola display, all lit-up in red and \nblue, installed within the view of the co-op building that had turned her \ndown. That's our Joan.",
