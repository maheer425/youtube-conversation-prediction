Notice this in Tea with \nMussolini, Ladies in Lavender, and the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (1 and 2) \nwhen she is paired with Dame Maggie Smith as well as in Cranford when she \nis with Dame Eileen Atkins. In both cases, Smith and Atkins play the elder \nhalf who is more cognitive, assertive and is clearly the \"leader\" of the \npair.\ufeff",
