Particularly as the proponents of FPTP say that anything else is too \ncomplicated, people won't understand etc. If something can actually go \nwrong or the system is too complicated then it will never get implimented. \nI actually just noticed this video is American; do you guys already have \nSTV? I'm British and I'd love it if we had this system in place.\n\nAnyway in the second example of STV where Tarsier gets illiminated first \nand his 5% gets added to Gorilla who then has 33%. You then eliminate Lynx \nand say that all his voters put Tiger as 2nd choice. Let's say instead all \nof Lynx's voters put Monkey as their 2nd choice with no further preference. \nLet's also say all of Monkey's voters simply put an x next to his name.\n\nSo in this hypothetical situation 13% of people voted Lynx and put Monkey \n2nd so after eliminating Lynx their votes get transferred to Monkey. This \nleaves us with Gorilla 33%, Monkey 46% and Tiger 21%. Because Monkey's \noriginal voters only put his name and Lynx's voters put noone after Monkey \nthere's no way to transfer Monkey's excess votes to anyone else. It's \nobvious Tiger should be the 3rd representative because we've eliminated \nTarsier and Lynx, however the algorithm does not allow for this. So how \nwould such a situation be solved?\ufeff",
