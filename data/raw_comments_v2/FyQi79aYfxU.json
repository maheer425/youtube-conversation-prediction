But then there's \nthat issue about them being human beings and not being able to remove their \nbias without the help of reviewers, this is a fair enough objection. The \nproblem though is that the vlogbrothers don't really try to make an effort \nto be impartial when it comes to the hot button issues like religion, gay \nmarriage, or political ideologies (which is where they should, in fact, be \nthe most impartial ideally speaking) and instead end up appealing to the \ndominant culture because it is more *trendy* to do so. I guess it's okay \nfor them to do since it's their right and everything... but that's the \nproblem: Freedom of speech and freedom expression was devised for a time \nwaaay different than now, and not necessarily planned for phenomena such as \nthe vlogbrothers becoming as popular as they've become. In some ways, this \ncan be good AND bad; but then I argue that liberal views bring people's \nexpectations to very high levels where it becomes more difficult for people \nto simply be happy anymore.\n^ really deep topic, lol\nThat's the main issue I have far left views, and is why I believe some \nthings they say contribute to lessening overall happiness in the world; and \nby extension, increasing \"worldsuck\".",

You're wrong that the \npress or media cannot express their beliefs, because they can and they do \n(omg they *absolutely do*, and often in the pursuit to make more money). \n*Ok, now the problem:*\nThe vlogbrothers are biased (in favor of first-world far left liberal \nviews). Based on the demographics of people that watch their vlogs, they \ninfluence their readers to some degree; namely the teenagers/young adults \nwho live in first world countries. \nIs this bad? Well most people would think not and you probably wouldn't \neither, BUT you have to keep in mind that if we want to be logical, \nrational, and above all, *be charitable to all views involved*, liberals \nare arguably a BAD bunch to associate with (just like the conservatives are \nalso arguably a bad bunch to associate with as well); especially the ones \nthat go around influencing young adults in the US who cannot reason on a \nstrong enough level to defend themselves from far-left ideologies. It is \nwhen you discover the inconsistencies and problems (that I still haven't \ngotten to) with the leftist ideologies that you see how they actually \ncreate \"worldsuck\" for people who can't defend themselves against it.",
