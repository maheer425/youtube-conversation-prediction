Now when he finds out that \nLetty died (even though she didn't really, but at the time it did seem like \nit) he realizes that his past life, his passion for racing and winning \nraces at whatever cost ended up costing him a part of his family, a pain \nthat was too hard for him to bear. So that's why from then on he puts \nfamily over everything, to make sure that doesn't happen again.
