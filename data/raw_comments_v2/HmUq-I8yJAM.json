This is very rare in Korea and would be a real \nstruggle without inside connections . Most self produced korean artist are \nnot as famous or widely known as companied own idols. Kpop idols are very \nhard working and deserve this , they do about roughly 6-7 concerts everyday \nand only sleep for a few hours in their van while also travelling to their \nnext concert. And they only get one day off in a whole week and even on \nthat day they might be practicing on their dance and composing more songs \n,so if you don't know much about them I suggest researching some more about \nthem\ufeff",
