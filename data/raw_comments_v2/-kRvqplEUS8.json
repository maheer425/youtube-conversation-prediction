It was his deep \nlove and care he had for them that touched their hearts. Everywhere he \nwent, he walked in love that no person had seen such a man as him ever. He \nwas and is strong, wise, gentle and all powerful who LOVES children so much \nso, he want us as Christians come to The Father as a little child (trusting \nat heart). \nGod never tormented the broken hearted at all, he had mercy on them. The \nfamilies going to the funerals are broken hearted and my God wants to bring \ncomfort to them.\n\nNo, I will never take sides with the kkk. The organization did many rotten \nthings to women and children. Not me, they are trash.\n\nHOWEVER, I DO VERY MUCH WOULD SUPPORT ANONYMOUS FOR THE FACT THEY ARE FOR \nTHE PEOPLE, THE UNDERDOG.

What I love seeing is the people coming out in force with \nsigns like \"God is Love\" and \"God Loves Peace.\" The Westboro people WANT \nyou to respond with hate and anger. What they don't want is their message \nto be made light of. To be ignored. For people to respond by pulling \ntogether in a peaceful way. If there is any real thing the Westboro people \nhave achieved, though they didn't intend it, it's to prove that we CAN \nstand together, sing together, coexist peacefully in the face of such pure \nhatred.
