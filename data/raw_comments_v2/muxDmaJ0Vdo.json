When you see a dog hurt, do you say I \ngot it worse than him? When you hear of children in the hospital with \nleukemia, do you say , so what , I have it worse than them.\nNo one can deny your entry into school, where you can get training to \nbecome an Astro physicist.

However the hijacking of mailing lists \nand the militant organizing and destruction of talks on the matter have \nsince caused scientists to back away from the argument replacing it with \none calling for care and protection of the afflicted. It doesn't make it \n\"not so\", Pally. Psychologists are not brawlers. they work to help people, \nbut rather than help people from homosexuality, like they would a wife \nbeater, they are called to force acceptance of a mutation upon the rest of \nsociety. Why? Because it is easier than telling the angry and afflicted \nthat there is something wrong with them and that they are unmendable. After \nall they can ride bicycles too. Retardation is a mental disorder but the \ntwo are exclusive. There is no queer gene, but, there are a lot of sad and \nangry people on the planet who have been hurt by the sexual predatory \nnature of sick bastards. Queers will not openly admit that they recall how \nthey deviated. It is easier to say, \"I've always been like this.\"\nI have always played guitar ;)\n\nEdit: Loving families have little to do with uncle Howie touching his \nnephew because he was touched or little Reggie being shy and succumbing to \nan all too early experience with another boy who was molested. I am saying \nthat deviation if given a chance to be truly examined would reveal more \nthan \"I have always been this way.\" This will take guts and honesty. Such \nhonesty would reveal women with negative body images experimenting with \nother women who have mental problems and more.\nScientists aren't bullies. In this day and age everyone wants to be liked \nor at the very least left to make a living without butting heads over \nsomething that Hollyweird and the media are all too willing to accept as \n\"normal.\" Look at the number of queers on T.V. who are over represented. \nThis is all about entertainment and not at all about the truth or pain. The \ntruth is if those who have been hurt by sexual abuse stop perpetuating the \nact there would be less deviation and less pain for society to contend \nwith. ThE eNd",
