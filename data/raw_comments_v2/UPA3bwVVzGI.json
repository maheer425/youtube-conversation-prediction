You will never have \"a surplus of whole \nnumbers\" because you will never stop matching them up. That's the thing \nabout infinity it never ends so we can't just look at the sets and see that \nthey match up. In order to prove mathematically that two sets have the same \nsize you have to come up with some way to match the elements up. Then if \nyou can prove that no matter what element from one set you pick you have an \nelement in the other set that matches up with it then we can say that the \ntwo sets have the same number of elements. In the case of the even numbers \nand the whole numbers it is the function f(x)=2x. No matter what whole \nnumber you give me I can plug it in to this function and match it up with \nan even number. And no matter what even number you give me I can divide it \nin half and get the whole number associated with it. And even though we \ncan't actually sit here and match them all up we can still show that this \nfunction would work if we actually could. Therefore we say that they have \nthe same number of elements.",

The higher the window cleaner gets, \nthe more he's extended the ladder, the more he extends the ladder, the \ncloser he constantly gets to 90 degrees- but due to the base always being 6 \nfeet away from the top of the ladder this is unachievable...\nThere's no doubt a simple answer to this- it's just been bugging me for \nyears and every maths teacher I've asked didn't seem to have a clue what \nthe hell I was talking about.

I \nsuppose if you take away the \"infinity\" and replace it with, \"very very \nvery high, lol, there is a constant as it's simply a right angled triangle, \nso the square of the hypotenuse (the ladder) is equal to the square of the \ntwo remaining sides (the building's height & the distance away from the \nbuilding the ladder is placed).

The angle will be smaller than \n90\u00b0 at any point but when considering infinity as well, it is smaller or \nequal to 90\u00b0. It is like the 0.999... number. No matter how many nines you \nhave, it is still smaller than 1. However if you have infinate number of \nnines, it sort of becames 1, because their difference is 0.000... so there \nis no difference at all. Technically it means that you can't show these two \nto be different. And since they behave absolutely the same no matter what \ntest you put them through, why say they are different at all? By definition \nthey are identical (having identical properties). Same with your angle, it \nwill always differ from 90\u00b0, but at infinity this difference will be \n0,00... which is not really different. So when you say it can never get \nthere, it can (at infinity, supposing you can get to infonity in first \nplace),, it just doesn't seem to be quite there to us. \nI am a mathematician myself, so I can only hope my explanation makes as \nmuch sence to you as it does to me :) enjoy",

Unfortunately, he also said the answer was \nnonsense (and erased the board).\n\nBut it's *not* nonsense. It's a prime example of the idea that there are \nmany infinities and some are bigger than others, while in the quantum side \nwe see those infinities at different scales and representing permutations \nof reality. Ergo, a Unified Theory of that nature depends entirely on the \nunderstanding of Multiverse construct of infinite infinities and \npermutations of scale and circumstance repeating structure like a \nMandelbrot fractal and also understanding that classical physics is \nconfined to a single infinite withing the infinite infinities of \npermutation.\n\nI never understood why Michio Kaku didn't see the answer right in front of \nhim if he was able to do the equation...",

We just call \nthat really big number infinite while it is clearly not.\nInfinity is an idea of lack of limit. You cannot add to Infinity because \nthe Infinite has neither beginning nor ending.\nSome mathematicians argue that you can divide something indefinitely, but \nits not possible, for example the fractals, you will eventually stop at the \niteration X, it will perhaps be a very big number but it is not infinite, \nin other words it is not without limit. However big this X be, its still \nlimited.\n\nLets count all the atoms in this universe, an atom is a limit, we are going \nto start counting from the 1st one and add another and add another and \nanother.\nPerhaps we are going to reach a number very big, so big that it is \ndifficult for us to comprehend but we will never reach Infinity. We will \nget to that last atom.\n\nYou cannot get to Infinity by adding limits together.\nOur perceptions are based on limits, we cannot perceive that which has no \nlimit.\nHypothetically if there were only white color of the same tonality your \neyes would not  perceive anything since there is no background nor \nforeground. Everything is the same.\n\nThe universe we are part of is based on limits, hence it is limited. It is \nundoubtedly VERY BIG but it is still limited.\n\nNow lets take 1 single atom of our universe and make a list of its \nproperties of size and mass, its components and its electrical charges and \nall the rules by which this atom is made of. Suppose that we know all that \nthere is to know about this atom.\n\nThat list would store all the ideas about that atom. Now ideas belong in \nthe mind. The mind chooses to think. The mind is the cause and the idea is \nits result.\nIf the mind chooses to release the idea, that idea would be gone. It would \nno longer exist in the mind.\nAn idea cannot escape the mind since it is the mind that is thinking that \nidea.\n\nWhatever atoms, or matter, or energy, or simply put, what ever FORM  you \nperceive - is in the mind.\nEverything you perceive is part of this mind, perhaps you think that Your \nMind is in your brain, but your brain is made of atoms and those atoms are \nin some mind.\n\nIt is one mind though. All this limited universe is in one mind, being \nthought by one mind. The ideas of this mind share one main property.\nThey Are Limits.\ufeff",

One might \nappear to be getting filled up at a different rate at another, but neither \ntree is ever completely \"filled up\" because they go on forever.\n\nTherefore one infinite set can't be bigger or smaller than another infinite \nset.
