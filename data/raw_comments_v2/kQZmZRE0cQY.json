            "text": "+c7i6abc (TL;DR at the end)\n\nAs you weren't in a rush anyway, I think I have an answer. The idea is you \nuse the Fibonacci numbers that add to the number you want. It's easiest if \nyou go backwards, so that you can essentially the biggest number you can \ninto your sum that won't go over your intended number, in your case 12. So \nthe choices are:\n21 13 8 5 3 2 1            for 12 you want:\n21 13 *8* 5 *3* 2 *1*\n21 is too much, 13 is too much, 8 fits and you have 4 left, 5 is too much, \n3 fits and leaves 1, 2 is too much, and 1 finishes it.\nWhat he's done is, essentially, in the nicest most loving and admiring way, \nbugger up.\nYou can see this in the yellow \"3\" sheet, where you have the little groups \nthat only 3 can make with the fewest possible digits in your sum to reach \nyour target. The basic ingredients of a number where 3 is essential are 3 \nand 4, and any other number can be made using a five. The sheet should show \ngroups of 2 digits, because the numbers on that sheet are 3 and 4 with \nanother Fibonacci number tacked on, the 3rd of the base group would be 5, \nwhich is already a Fibonacci number and so unnecessary. 3 is needed for any \nnumber 3 or 4 digits above a Fibonacci number, but not 5 above as that \nnumber can be made with the 5 from the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nSo for the yellow \"3\" sheet, you should get these groups of 2, as you go \nthrough these bands where only a 3 will do, but you'll see on the sheet \nthat 11 is on it's own, and is the only one on it's own (except 32 as 33 is \nout of the range for whatever reason). The parts with 3 follow the pattern \n*3*, *3+1*, 8+*3*, 8+*3+1*, 13+*3*, 13+*3+1*; ect, ect, ect. So \nessentially, you should be seeing the 12 on that \"3\" sheet.\n\nI should say I notice a flaw either in my thinking or in his entire system \nfor these cards involving the number 12 on the \"1\" sheet, but I doubt \nyou've even read this far so I'll spare you.\n\nTL;DR: He got it wrong and this is difficult to think about so fair play to \nhim anyway, 12 should be on the \"3\" sheet and the \"1\" sheet instead of the \n\"5\" sheet.",
