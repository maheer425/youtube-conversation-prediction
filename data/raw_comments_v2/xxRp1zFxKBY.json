At 1:56 is the exhaust side, you will count 6 exhaust runners \nconnecting the head to the downpipe, which connects to the 6 individual \nchrome exhaust tips. That part which does all the connecting is an exhaust \nmanifold. At 4:42 is the intake side, you will find there is not a manifold \nconnecting the head to the exhaust tips in any way. In the same location on \nthis side of the engine, you will see the 6 gray plug wires going to the \nhead where there must then be 6 spark plugs, and the other kind of manifold \nknown as an intake manifold to which the carb is mounted. The \"exhaust \nmanifold\" you're referring to on this side is actually just exhaust tips, \nprobably welded on for show, or connected to the other side with a plenum \nbox of some kind underneath.\n\n   This is an engine with one bank if cylinders, see how it's a straight \nline, not a \"V\"?  Since there are 6 exhaust runners on the exhaust side, \nand 6 plugs on the intake side, we can assume it is a inline or straight 6. \nBut if that's too complex for you, count the wires on the distributor at \n2:20 you will find there are 7. 1 for each cylinder and 1 for the coil. \nThis is absolutely a straight six. I'm not sure why you would think this is \na V10...V10s have two banks of cylinders and two heads. There is nothing \nthat would suggest that statement is true, even in the eyes of a novice car \nguy. I can seen how a novice would think this is a v12 maybe because there \nare 12 exhaust tips...but it's neither.\n\n  And there are many manufacturers of inline sixes that produce more torque \nthan this thing even does. Including Mac, Cummins, and International to \nname a few. They are the best engine for pulling due to their torque \npotential and their perfectly balanced crankshafts. I am a diesel \nserviceman, I know what I'm looking at.\n\n   Ever seen a V10 with one bank of cylinders, 7 wires going off the \ndistributor, 6 exhaust ports on one side of the single head, and 6 spark \nplugs? Me neither, class dismissed.  ",
