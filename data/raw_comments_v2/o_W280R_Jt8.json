After going the same speed on the \nroad can you still feel a difference? No because you can only feel \nacceleration, and the earth is going at a constant speed, and the air is \nmoving alongside the earth much like a pressurized car. We arent flung off \nthe earth because gravity always pulls to the center of an object. Why \ndoesnt the earth slide under us when we jump? Just like in a car do you \nslide backwards when you jump in a moving car?",

The earth is moving at 465.1 metres per second, at the surface, \nat the equator. Someone who jumps up in the air keeps moving at this speed, *as \ndoes the atmosphere around them*. They don't suddenly stop moving, leaving \nthe earth to move under them and atmosphere to move around them. If they \ndid, the deceleration and wind forces would tear them apart. They go up, \nkeep moving at the same rate as the earth AND the atmosphere, and return to \nthe same point they left.\n\nAccording to your view, I think, if they jumped up and down in a quarter of \na second, the earth would have moved over 100 metres (one-quarter of 465.1 \nmetres) under them, and that just does not happen ....
