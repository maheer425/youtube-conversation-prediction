The blind man pities the Creature and \nwants to help him, since he can't see his face and is therefore unafraid of \nhim. But just at that moment, the father's children return and, seeing the \nCreature, they think he's there to do their father harm and they chase him \naway.

The monster or the \ncreator?\" - My understanding is that the monster and/or the creator can't \nbe accused definitely like the way a math problem can be solved definitely. \nTherefore, I deem this question unanswerable. Why spend time thinking about \nsomething that is unanswerable? Your thoughts are much appreciated --- \nMaybe just for pleasure, or it might stimulate the brain in a way that \nhelps people to think more deeply about things. But then you have to \nrealize that you can also learn to think deeply with questions that are \nactually answerable and that can accomplish something useful, like \nscientists seem to do - I tend to think that this is what Einstein and \nNewton did with stuff like gravitation and other things that, you know, \nhave been around for all existence - things beyond most of the relatively \npointless (yet enjoyable) arts and cultures and stuff that humans have \ncreated, arts and cultures that fade away and are eventually replaced. It's \nthe questions of natural occurrences, not human created matters, that \nreally interest me personally, because those things are universal and those \nquestions are more likely to answer things like why the universe exists or \nwhy the sky is blue.\n\nEdit: it's now 7 months after I first posted this, and my mindset changed a \nlittle. I now think that cultures and arts are important maintaining \npeople's sanity. Without those, I don't think we would be able to \ncommunicate as well and live as happily without.

No matter how \nunnatural. That man could dominate all aspects of life, including the most \nessential, conception. Yet, Frankenstein's creation was a failure in the \nsense that the monster came from a laboratory, not a uterus. Thus, \nfortifying the belief that women are equal to men, that they are equal to \nFrankenstein in the sense that they can conceive life better than him. I'm \nnot sure if I might be close to being correct, but to be honest there are a \nlot of novels that seem to have homoerotic subtexts. Such as The Last of \nthe Mohicans. They seem to, though. ",
