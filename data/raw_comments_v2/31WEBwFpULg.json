Time travel \nis not possible as there are many conflicting theories. But if you'd like, \ntime dilation is. \n\nThe \"looking into the past\" thing is merely just remnants of dead stars, \nwhose radiation took x amount of years to reach us.

It only seems that time exists \nsince we are observers of our universe. \n\nYou'd like to believe that theories come out of thin air, out of nowhere \nfrom someone's mind.

Because it wasn't taught to you that way???\n\nIf a \"Parallel Dimension\" is not a Dimension of Time, Real-Time or \nSpacetime, what the HELL our they talking about by using that term then???\n\nSkip a \"Time-Line\" and other Universes... To me; A Parallel Dimension is \nsimply another side of reality of this same Universe. The only reason a \nParallel Dimension can ever exist, is because of the many different \ndirections Time can go into which then creates those Parallel Realities... \nall at the same Time. LOL\n\nFurthermore; There is real new studies showing Time itself (Past, Present & \nFuture) in our own so called Dimension having curvature to it. With \nPowerful enough Telescopes, Scientists are now claiming to see into our own \nUniverses Past, Present & also (believe it or not) Future! It's so many new \nsides to Time and what it really is, that we can no longer think of Time as \na straight line. Don't take my word for it though; We can always learn much \nmore than we know and do much more research. Who's to say if any of this is \nall real in the first place???\n\nOn Another Note: To me, it's not always about what I learned (in school or \nelsewhere), but also about what I can teach myself, and/or imagine leading \nto (trying, testing, creating) new things. If you always accept another's \ndiscovery as full truth, you'll never discover your own truth. Did Einstein \nnot say, \"Imagination Is More Important Than Knowledge\"?\n\nAs an Artist; I already believed that phrase to be true. Many times in my \nlife, I proved several facts of being true, which started first, nowhere \nelse but in my thoughts / ideas, within my mind first. Scientists do this \nall the time; It's called a theory. Seeing as if none of us really know WTF \nTime nor \"Spacetime\" truly is in the first place, we can all speculate. \nDon't I have a right to my own opinions and theories, just the same as the \nnext thinking mind?

Again though, that has nothing to do with time. In \nyour example, we are talking about other universes.
