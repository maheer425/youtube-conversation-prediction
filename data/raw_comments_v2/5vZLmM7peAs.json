Don't have that feeling inside thinking \n'this generation' should go through what you went through. If we do then we \naren't changing, nothing isn't happening, we aren't making a difference, we \naren't getting stronger, nor wiser. If you don't guide us then who can \nguide if we haven't been lead? This is what makes our generation so \nspecial. Young girls have gotten the courage to sit in front of a camera \nonce a week to acknowledge problems we may have. This is change, this is \nguiding. So I want to thank any lady who has ever stop to give advice or \nencouragement to women in general. At the end of the day we all need each \nother and we all need a little inspiration. If you are reading this I want \nyou to know that you are who you are because you are special, you have the \nchoice of your individuality meaning you are your own person and no one can \ntake that away from you. You are what you put yourself out to be, today \njust randomly approach someone and tell them something nice, I can already \nfeel the change!\n\nThank you\n~Allie\ufeff",
