Everybody has to work there ass off to survive; and maybe \nthey'd be welcome if they took the proper channels to become an American \ncitizen and contribute to society rather than thinking they don't have to \nabide by the laws in the \"land of opportunity\" and can come over here \nillegally and take the jobs of citizens. The reason they're on foot walking \nthrough the deserts is because they cannot use the roads like people \nobeying the law. Get off your liberal high horse and ditch the little guy \nsyndrome. I feel more for the people who came here legally and struggle as \nmuch as the illegals and have shit to show for it; the only difference is \nthey did their due diligence and are in the same boat as the free riders.",
