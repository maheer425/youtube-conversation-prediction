Also , buy one \nget one free often works ( not always, but often).  As for water - it \ntastes different , depending on a company, and maybe you do not feel it, \nother people do.

I really don't know, it's about 2 tickets a year on average though, \nbut i've got excellent timing so it seems.\nAnd we once had a tv break down exactly one day after the warranty expired, \nextended warranty would give us a new tv would it break beyond repairing, \nand so it did 2 hours after the warrenty expired it broke down beyond \nrepairing, probably installed to break down after said period of time, i \nstill can't believe it.\nAnd unlead oil is very good for certain engines, it's not really pooring \nmoney down the drain, especially good for smaller engines such as the ones \nfrom scooters.\nAnd the all you can eat buffet, hmm i never saw an all you can eat buffet \nthat costed more than a visit to a regular restuarant.\nOn average a regular resto visit would cost me 15\u20ac, same would go for an \nall you can eat buffet, plus having so much variaty is very nice. i'd pay \nan extra 5\u20ac for that anytime, knowing that i won't be left craving for more \nwith a 90/95% filled belly, no instead i'd be left craving for more but \nwith my belly one hundred percent filled.\nCan't express my feelings when i go to a restuarant only to sit there for \n45 mins untill my food is ready and i'm not hungry anymore and when i \nfinished  (if i finish my plate, since i'm not hungry anymore but my \nstomach is still empty) my plate i'm not even entirely filled, sure i could \norder a dessert, but desserts i can buy at the bakery for even less money, \nyou had better put that in your movie, buying desserts in a restuarant is a \nrip off, you get a desert you can eat in one bite for 4\u20ac when you can buy a \ndesert for 3\u20ac at the bakery twice the size.\nLike buying an ice cream in a restuarant is an even bigger rip off, 6\u20ac for \n3 scoops of ice with half a strawberry and a piece of chocolate, holy shit \nand it's the same price for a milkshake, ice and milk and probably a banana \nor two costs a whopping 6\u20ac but that's alright, just don't buy premium gas \nand you'll be alright, if you're driving a new modern vehicle that is, \notherwise the feul will (might) damage your engine and the repairs, well \nthose cost more money than you would have \"lost\" should you have bought \npremium gas.\nBut when i walk into a restaurant and all i have to do is take a plate and \ntake whatever the fuck i want, well i'd take that over a regular resto \nvisit any day, if i could afford it :)\ufeff",

Tap water isn't bad, but still doesn't have the mineral content of \nspring water. I like well water a lot too, considering the well isn't taken \nfrom an area high in sulfur.
