Im half \nway there to 30 already and although i am young, I'm not THAT young \nconsidering what i think is expected of me by the time i reach 30 yrs old.\n\n My understanding is that by the time people reach 30 yrs old, they are \nexpected to be more mature and be more settled in life. This means being \ndone with education for the most part, have reasonable career established \nalready...etc. To some, this could involve marriage and having children, \nwhile some never date anyone in life or some chose not to get married. For \nsome, It may unfortunately mean a divorce, so they can move on and settle \nwith their own life. whatever it is that is on your plate, i think by the \ntime you are 30 yrs old, maturity and certain level of settlement is \nrequired. \n\nThis is not to say that everyone must have x,y and z accomplished by the \ntime they turn 30 yrs old... everyone's life is different and you can't \njudge anyone based on career, marital status or educational status. After \nall, life isn't a checklist right?\ufeff",
