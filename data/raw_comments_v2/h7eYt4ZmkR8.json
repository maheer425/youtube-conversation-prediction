Most people \nprobably would be surprised by this statement.\nDr. Michio Kaku in the video of *\"the Science of Dreams\"* provides \nscientific facts about how our brain work when we are awake and while we \nare in sleep. He also discusses if *lucid dreaming* is possible or not in \nthis video.\n#brain #neuroscience #dream #luciddreaming #michiokaku  \ufeff",

Most of my normal dreams seemed to be centered \naround my emotions and how I truly felt about things going on in my current \nlife, so I had a good feeling my memories were connected to strong \nemotions. Anyway, it took about 3 nights to pull off, but I did it. \nHowever, there was a catch...\n\nIn the dream, I put myself in a long, white hallway with a door at the end, \nmuch like the 2nd Matrix movie in the Keymaker scene, but I understood \nthere were memories behind this door. So I walked to the door, grabbed the \ndoorknob, and only cracked the door open wide enough to peak in...and...I \nrelived EVERY single thing I've ever regretted since I was 3 years \nold...even the smallest things like forgetting to vacuum the living room \nbefore my parents got home or something. I can't exactly recall the \nmemories I saw anymore. I assume it's stored away in my subconscious mind. \nBut the memories went backwards in time in chronological order and they \nstopped when I was 3 years old, and then repeated. You can only imagine \njust how much I witnessed if a 3 year old had something to regret lol.\n\nThe memories were so intense that it woke me up from my sleep, and I could \nstill see these memories flashing before my eyes one after another in the \ndarkness of my room for about 10-15 seconds, as they slowly faded away. The \nwhole ordeal seemed to only last 20 seconds including when I woke up from \nthe dream. That means I was seeing multiple memories every second, but I \ncould see them all as clear as a night sky in Texas.\n\nSo, I haven't tried to do it again since then. Not only did I have a \n\"laundry list\" of factors I had to overcome the first time but if I can't \ncontrol which \"door\" I'm going to be peaking into next time, then I'm \nafraid to even try it again. \n\nAnd I can't stress enough how intense this dream was though. I wish I \npossessed the proper literary skills to describe just how intense it was \nbut I'll try to sum it up: It's similar to how I feel on roller coasters \nand I'm afraid of heights. That dream really messed up my mood for a full \n24 hours and it left me with a pretty good headache....and I only opened my \n\"door of regrets\". Just imagine if it were my \"door of sorrows\".\ufeff",

I went to a hospital \nlooking for my record, but the record keeper was away.  I insisted to see \nhim and they told me he was inside a column next to where I was standing, \noutside from the record archives.  I went straight to the column and opened \na small door.  He was a bat, hanging next to the small door.
