            "text": "+Pedro Purcino well im not gonna bother reading that entire flame war.\n\nbut i will bother answering your first response:\n\nnukes are measured in kilotons and megatons, as in how many thousands or \nmillions of tons of TNT are equivalent to the explosion.\n\nlet's put things into perspective:\n\nthe bomb dropped on hiroshima was 15 kilotons of explosive power. meaning \n15 THOUSAND tons of TNT, or 15 MILLION KILOGRAMS of TNT... \n\nhere's a picture of perspective:\n\nhttp://i387.photobucket.com/albums/oo320/Nmenth/TNT4.jpg\n\nhiroshima, i might remind you, was one of the smallest nuclear detonations \nin recorded history. if you wanted to carpet bomb a planet, it would not be \nsuitable. what WOULD be suitable would be the Tsar bomb.\n\nthe Tsar bomb was the largest single nuclear detonation. it had an \nexplosive force of 50 MEGAtons. that's 50 MILLION tons of TNT, or 50 \nBILLION kg of TNT.\n\nhere's more pictures to give you a better sense of scale:\n\nhttp://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9d50d939638c4b5fa1881876ee494f3d?convert_to_webp=true\n\nthis is the power of hiroshima's explosion as compared to that of the Tsar \nbomb.\n\nhttp://www.tsarbomba.org/images/Comparative_nuclear_fireball_sizes.png\n\nthis is the comparison of the Tsar bombs blast radius compared to that of \nother nukes. nagasaki is the smallest one in the picture. hiroshima's blast \nradius was too small to be depicted accurately.\n\nhttp://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--97Wdg1Ud--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/17k71xh2xk2zdjpg.jpg\n\nthis is a photo that draws out each individual kiloton of TNT to give you \nan idea of scale.\n\nhttp://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--aVCCzCFN--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/17k71xqy4i81kjpg.jpg\n\nthe tsar bomb's explosive potential was so great, it had to be put into an \nimage separate from that of the others in this comparison.\n\nand finally, we have the raw tonnage of TNT required visualized:\n\nhttp://s387.photobucket.com/user/Nmenth/media/TNT5.jpg.html\n\neven further, the tsar bomb that was actually detonated was a watered down \nversion that used a lead lining instead of the production version's \ndepleted uranium lining. a FULL tsar bomb would have had the explosive \npotential of 100 megatons (or, 100 million tons, or 100 BILLION kgs, or 220 \nBILLION pounds of TNT). so, go back, look through those images, and double \neverything you just saw for the tsar bomb in comparison to everything else.\n\neven further, you would need many tsar bombs to hit every major population \narea on pandora. let's say, 30, just for good measure. so in addition to \nthe doubling you just did, go back and multiply all those comparisons by \n30, to get the full scope of what a real world orbital bombardment would \nrequire... to put that into perspective, that is 3000 megatons, or 3 \nGIGAtons of TNT. that's 3 BILLION tons of TNT, or, 3 TRILLION kgs of TNT, \nor 6.6 TRILLION pounds of TNT.\n\n... yeah, i dont think conventional explosives are the way to go in any \norbital bombardment. good luck getting even a measurable fraction of that \n6.6 trillion pounds of TNT into orbit, let alone all the way to pandora... \nand on what? a ship that masses far less than that. in order to even \nTRANSPORT 6.6 trillion pounds of TNT, you need a ship that masses far more \nthan that... yeah, good luck with that. so trust me when i say an orbital \nbombardment with conventional explosives is utterly pointless or utterly \nimpossible.\n\npeople always make the mistake of underestimating the power of nuclear \nweapons. conventional explosives dont even compare, and never will.",
