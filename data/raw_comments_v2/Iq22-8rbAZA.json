First off, I think VlogBrothers does a great \njob, and you guys should raise money any way you can.  You're creating \ngreat content, and also promoting educational and humanitarian efforts, \nwhich you should raise money for so you can do more of that.\n\nHowever, some of the pre-roll advertisements are obscenely long, like \nlonger than your own videos.  One day I threw on a VlogBrothers playlist, \nand the pre-roll video was 15 minutes long... Not exaggerating.  \n\nIf there's a way you can limit that, I highly encourage it.  Or send a \nletter to YouTube management.  \ufeff",
