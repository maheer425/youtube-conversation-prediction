George Bush planned to moove missles to \nRussian' backyard in order to protect as he claimed the Eastern Europe from \nan air-attack from Iran. Russian's said that this was a bullshit but the \nAmericans did it. In this case did we respected Russians? No\n\n2) The new members of EU (Baltic states and Eastern states) still suffers \nfrom meta-soviet travma. They must realize that now they are members of EU \nand nobody can attack them. They also must remember that today Russia is \nnot the old Soviet Union. So they must stop poison the relations between EU \nand Russia.\n\n3) Ucraine crisis. It is obvius that the Americans gave money to the \nUcrain's opposition in order to kick out Yanukovits. But inside Ucrain's \nopposition were also Nazi. As i remember well the first thing that they \nordered after they got power was to forbid the use of Russian language in \nUcraine. Crimean;s citizens are Russian's nationality, and they didn't want \nto participate in this NEW Ucraine. So they asked from their mother-land to \njoin them without one death.\nWhy did Americans help Kosovo to declare indepedence, they bombed Serbia \nbut Crimea's citizens didn't had the right to choose to join Russia??\ufeff",

            "text": "\"Narrative, narrative, narrative.\" How tired I am of this word. How about \n\"facts\" or \"truth\" or \"decency.\"\n \nWhat has happened is that Putin and his regime prepared groups \nof terrorists and utter scum (some from Ukraine, some from Russia) and had \nthem stage attempted coups in selected Ukrainian cities. In Crimea, they \nstormed the Parliament building in the middle of the night, turned on the \nlight and within minutes elected/proclaimed themselves the government of \nCrimea. In most other places the weren't as successful, but they did spill \nblood in cities like Odessa. In Kharkiv they replaced the Ukrainian flag \nwith that of Russia and proclaimed themselves \"Kharkov People's Republic,\" \nbut were defeated. Then they tried to assassinate the mayor, and almost \nsucceeded.\n \nSoon support came from Russia, both in weapons and in soldiers and officers \nof the occupational army. Russian government still denies it, but there is \nno doubt that not just volunteers, not just \"volunteers\", but regular army \nunits are in Ukraine. Some of these units were even deceived, told they are \ngoing to nearby Rostov (in Russia) for training, and then suddenly found \nthemselves in the war zone.\n \n\"Referendums\" were then conducted in occupied lands without independent \nobservers and under gun barrels of the occupying army.\n \nAll this in blatant violation of a whole load of previous treaties, \ndeclarations and agreements, from 1991 Belavezha Accords to 1994 Budapest \nMemorandum.\n \nAll this is not a \"narrative\", but straightforward facts.\n \nOf course, one can present a Russian \"narrative\" regarding \"restoring \nhistorical justice\" by occupying Crimea or \"liberating\" their Ukrainian \nbrothers from \"Nazi banderovites and their American puppet masters,\" or \nthat the whole thing is \"restoring historical justice\", since Ukraine \ndoesn't exist, never did and never will (as some in Putin's circles are \nsaying). One can just as well present a Nazi narrative regarding Germany \nmerely \"defending itself from Jewish aggression\" on the soil of Poland, \nHolland, Greece or Soviet Union, or \"restoring historical justice\" by \noccupying France.\n \nWhere are we going with all these \"narratives?\"\ufeff",
