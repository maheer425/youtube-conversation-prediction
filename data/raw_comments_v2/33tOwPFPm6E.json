Is \nthis regular olive oil or extra virgin? They often just say that they're \nusing olive oil. From what I've read and understood, is extra Virgin olive \noil's smoke point too low to be used for this but regular olive oil's smoke \npoint is fine? Does that mean extra Virgin olive oil is meant to be used \npredominantly for drizzling on top of things such as salads etc. Thanks in \nadvance for the clarification!! \ufeff",
