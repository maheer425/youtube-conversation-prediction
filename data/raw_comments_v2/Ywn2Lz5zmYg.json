In this case time travel isn't real but dimensional travel \nis and with science's recent advancements it is more plausible. \n\nThis also supports the branch theory of \"time traveling\" as it means that \nwhatever was altered in the past will have an affect on the future. Once a \nchange is mad then a whole knew reality is made. So if a left dimension \"X\" \nand went to a dimension similar to dimension \"X\" where it is November 22, \n1963 and stop Kennedy from being assassinated then that galaxy is now \ndimension \"X-a\" as it's path has been altered and will continue with an \nalive Kennedy.
