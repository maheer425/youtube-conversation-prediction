            "text": "Nice video Ill share some of my results with you I have had over the years. \nthe worst headlights and damage on cars Ive ran into are the  buick \nrendezvous and the 2000-2004 chevy impala. if they let the damage go too \nfar the lights are not repairable at all. Also I have been around body \nshops most my entire life . We have always found that 2000 grit is just a \nfinishing paper. starting with 400 is necessary on some lights even 320 Ive \nhad to use . but I jump from 400 to 800 grit with no issues before clearing \nthe lights . any good automotive clear with uv inhibitors will work and \nclear from a can even covers 600 grit scratches easily . I use 800 grit \njust to be sure. I feel that 2000 grit is too far and is actually making it \nmore difficult for the clear to adhere to the lights as it kinda buffs them \nout. most of the lights I encounter only need 800 grit and clean and spray. \ntrial and error have led me down the path of trying to conserve \nmaterials...lol\n\nanother trick Ive learned is the cleaning and sanding with pure water is \nnice but to speed things up try some of the simple green cleaner . It \ncleans most of the yellow off the lights as you sand and is a way better \nlubricant than the water . it cuts my sanding time in half. just before \nclearing the lights I dont use alcohol as it is prone evaporation  in \nvehicles if stored. I use the spray away glass cleaner in the aerosol  can \n. it is a great way degrease the lights and stores easier . the clears Ive \ntried that I like are upol clear number 1.   scratch wizard headlight \nrestore clear . spray max 2k clear its pricey ... but if you have 6 cars to \ndo its well worth it . all of these clears have quality and user friendly \nspray tips .  ones ive used with little success is the spedokote uv curing \nclear it likes to fish-eye and orange peal. the duplicolor clear from \nautoparts outlets is the worst it dried almost matte finish. and the \nrustoleam auto clear it came out too fast from the can dried uneven and had \nto water sand to make smooth , so not very user friendly.   hope this \nhelps.\ufeff",

I sprayed three light layers, \nwaiting 5-10 minutes in between sprays. I let it sit for 24 hours but it \nwas still foggy. I sanded it down again and tried it over. I still ended up \nwith the same result, foggy. I used the clear coat gloss, same brand and \nproduct used in the video. The paint left a layer of fogginess that I'm not \nsure how to get rid of.

Yes \nit needs to be removed from the vehicle. Buff lightly with plastic compound \ndo not burn the plastic. Buff horizontally and vertically. All coatings \nwill eventually cloud on a cars headlights. Regardless. Too much heating \nand cooling of the surfaces occurs. That is why the plastic clouds to begin \nwith. Tail lights don't do that, so it's not the sun so much.\nThis method in the video may be a better choice for those without the tools \nor knowledge of how to remove the headlight or to use a buffer correctly. \nGood video man.\ufeff",
