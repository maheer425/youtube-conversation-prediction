Some 50k \nwhites die at the hands of other whites, not to mention od's, if you ever \ntake your eye off black balls, you'd readily see the cracks and crackheads \nof your people as easy as you see ours.\n\nRepeating, propaganda doesn't make you intelligent.  Knowing when your \nbeing lied to does.   You live in a country with more debt than income, the \nmost crime, and stupidest people, of which most are white and you can't see \n\"you\"\nmeaning white people have the most and biggest problems based on numbers.\n\nFacts are 1-3% of whites owned slaves, both white and black, the slaves I \nmean.  That translates to maybe 7 mill. leaving 210 mil. to be descendants \nfrom bums and convicts, your facts not mine.  To think because they let you \nuse Bill gates to inflate your worth on paper, makes you more than a Black \nperson similar in every way is a mistake on your part and we have \"white \nidiots\" to blame for the 20 trillion dollar debt we owe now.  You have the \nnumbers to chanllenge gov't, but were fooled into thinking being white \nmakes you valuable.  Ask the veterans, after the Va scandal which won't \nchange because the avg. person is worthless, white included.  If they were \nconsidered heroes they'd make more than cart pusher wages.
