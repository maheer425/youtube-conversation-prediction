I may have been so much so \nthat I crossed into being something a bit more offensive, or appeared to be \nforcing my views onto you, which was not my intention. To be perfectly \nhonest, I agree with your rating of this sketch. It's one of their weaker \nones. I just often get the impression from posts expressing negativity \nabout a sketch that the poster doesn't understand that not all sketches are \nas funny to all people. I see now that you understand that, and apologize \nif my recommendation towards the end of my first post seemed condescending \nor otherwise offensive.\n\nAgain, sorry for the bluntness, your opinion is entirely valid, and \nfeedback is always good.\n\nAnyway, props to you as well.
