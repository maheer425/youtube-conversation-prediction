            "text": "Jarvan IV for sure. He's by far a safer pick in all levels of play. In the \njungle Jarvan has really great crowd control (even pre-6) and basically \ndunks everyone after he hits 6. He's a great jungler to have when you have \na team who has a top or mid lane with minimal CC such as Fiora or \nMordekaiser. He's also GREAT against teams who have very little escapes \nsuch as Lux, Vel'koz, Morde, etc. because of his ultimate making it \nimpossible for them to escape without burning a flash. He's also extremely \ntanky and can initiate really well. However, he's not exactly the \n\"Easiest\". He's not the hardest by any means but he requires you to watch \nhis cool downs and position yourself so you can land an optimal E-Q. \n\nCataclysm is also a hard ability. If you use it poorly then it could turn a \nwon fight into a loss. For example. If you have a Fizz shark stuck to you \nand you cataclysm an enemy who's reeking havoc on your team, causing the \nshark to deal huge AoE damage to your whole team.\n\nA quick tip for any J4 players (I'm a J4 main btw) is that with enough CDR \nyou can Q to the same E twice before the flag expires. This is useful \nbecause you can knock up large clusters of enemies twice in one fight if \nyou position yourself well enough. \n\nHOWEVER! Nocturne is a good choice if you're looking to carry games. He's \njust not as safe of a pick as the all mighty J4. ",
