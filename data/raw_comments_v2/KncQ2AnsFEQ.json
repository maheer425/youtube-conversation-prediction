Idk, but here you go.\n\nVlogbrothers is a channel created by John and Hank Green (brothers) in 2007 \nwho saw a potential for a great community in youtube. The content at first \nconsisted of them doing and saying whatever they want, but converted to a \npre-teen friendly place (even though most subscribers are from ages 15 to \n30). They made rule's for the time of the video (Four minutes and one \nsecond for non-informational content) and if one didn't upload on their day \n(John is Tuesday and Hank is Friday) they could be punished. EXAMPLE: \nWaxing chin hair; spending 15 hours in target.\n\nAs the community grew, the fans of vlogbrothers started calling themselves \n\"Nerdfighters\", a term John misread on a video game in an airport. The \ncommunity is now referred to as Nerdfighteria. Nerdfighteria has raised \nmillions of dollars for multiple charities, and has a goal to decrease \nworld suck. The term DFTBA (Don't forget to be awesome) is also used to \nsignify that you are part of the community, and is told to others to either \nbrighten their spirits or as a snappy comeback. \n\nJohn green is an author who has written The Fault in our Stars (TFIOS), \nPaper Towns,Will Grayson Will Grayson, Looking for Alaska (my personal \nfavorite) and an Abundance of Katherine's. He has won a few awards and has \nbeen #1 on the best seller list, eventually getting his latest book The \nFault in our Stars made into a movie this past June only two years after it \nwas written. Nerdfighteria is also looking forward to Looking for Alaska \nand Paper Towns being made into a movie.\n\nHank Green is a musician. He rights funny and educational songs that every \nnerdfighter adores no matter the tempo. After he wrote a song about Harry \nPotter the channel gained more popularity, and is now at 2,000,000+ \nsubscribers.",

And I watched the movie with my friends btw we \nhad to see a councilor to get over Gus's death and yes thats how much I \nloved him its just that once I read a book I become attached and begin to \nknow and love the character and seeing Gus die is like seeing my boyfriend \ndie so I really could relate.
