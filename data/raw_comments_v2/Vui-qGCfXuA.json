You say that Hans \nisland is a land border between Canada and Greenland, when in reality, \nbecause of it's size, it isn't. You can relate that same manner to \nembassies. Many countries border other countries that are halfway across \nthe world from each other because of embassies in their country.\nYou also don't get what water borders mean. Water borders relate to inland \nwaters, not sea or oceanic waters. If water borders included sea or oceanic \nwater borders, Australia would border New Guinea, Japan with Russia, USA \nwith Russia, Spain and Morocco, Qatar with Yemen etc. This would also \ninclude Canada with France, because of New Brunswick bordering the French \nterritories of St. Pierre and Miquelon. \nAlso the Mercator projection is inaccurate. It depicts Greenland about the \nsame size of Africa, when in reality Africa is roughly 14 times larger than \nGreenland. \nSo it goes to show, you're illiterate to an extent, because you thought \nthat I meant New Brunswick was a French territory somehow, and don't know \nsimple terms and definitions.",

Hans island also isn't \nreally considered a border either, even though it is Canadian and \nGreenlandic land on the island.
