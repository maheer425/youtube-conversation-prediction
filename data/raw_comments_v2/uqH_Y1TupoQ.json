Let me break this one down to you.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with making videos about your own country or *any \nother subject matter that interests you*. For you to say that \neveryone/anyone needs to make videos about other countries, despite the \nfact that other countries do not interest them or aren't relevant to them, \nis far more ignorant than anything else in this entire conversation. Why \ndoes everyone need to know about your country? We does everyone need to \nknow about my country? Simple answer- They don't.\nHowever interesting other cultures may be, not everyone NEEDS to take \ninterest in them and be forced feed facts that are completely irrelevant to \ntheir lives. You use insular as though its an insult, or a belittling \nstatement, when its not.\n\nLet me explain it to you this way. Its analogous to me liking cats and \nwanting to make a video about cats, however you say, \"there are more \nanimals in the world than just cats, you are ignorant for not taking \ninterest in other animals and you should make videos about animals that are \nrelevant to non-cat lovers.\"\nWhile its true, there are other animals, and they probably are fascinating, \nyou have literally no right or reason to force me or anyone to take \ninterest in those animal. Ignoring those animals is not ignorance, its \ndisinterest. Belittling people for the things they don't care about is pure \nbigotry.\n\n\nUltimately, why would a cat-lover ever make a video about another animal, \njust because other animals exist? Why would a person who's only interested \nin American laws, make a video about laws from other countries? The \ndemographic of this video is Americans. You have to accept that you just \naren't represented in this video. There are probably million of videos \nwhere you, your country, and your numerous interests ARE represented. \nTrying to get everyone to represent your interests just because your \ninterests exist, is ridiculous and immature.\n\nI respect that you want other people to expand their horizons and learn \nabout other countries, but it would be completely ignorant of you to assume \neveryone should like and care about the same things you like and care \nabout. It would be ignorant to assume that everyone needs to learn about \nother countries when I'm sure possibly hundred of millions of people are \ncompletely content, educated, well-rounded and cultured without ever \nknowing anything about anyone elses country aside from their own.\n\nMaybe in your country people like to make content that doesn't interest \nthem just so they can represent every single person that might come across \ntheir videos, but where I live people are allowed to do whatever they want. \nAnd I don't go around telling people they need to represent my country or \nelse they are ignorant, because that would be ignorance in of itself.\n\nAnd for the record. I watch plenty of videos about all sorts of countries. \nHowever, when I see ridiculous remarks, like your own, I'm compelled to \nshow them just how illogical they sound.",

            "text": "+SomeDudeOnline Jury nullification is not returning a guilty verdict but no \nsentence. It is this: the right of the jury to give a guilty or not guilty \nverdict despite what the law or evidence points to. It might make better \nsense in an example. Imagine a legal system that makes abortion a crime. \nKirsten is tried for aborting her child. The judge and lawyers advise the \njury that to return a guilty verdict the law states that there must be \nclear evidence of an intentional abortion. Medical records prove that \nKirsten had an abortion. The judge advises the jury the law has been \nbroken. BUT the jury choose to return a not guilty verdict because although \nthe law has been broken, they do not believe in sending people to jail who \nhave had an abortion. That is jury nullification.",
