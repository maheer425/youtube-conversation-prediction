Felix reached a maximum of speed of 1,357.6 km/h or 843.6 \nmph(Mach 1.25) through the near vacuum of the stratosphere before being \nslowed by the atmosphere later during his 4:20 minute long freefall. The \n43-year-old Austrian skydiving expert also broke two other world records \n(highest freefall, highest manned balloon flight), leaving the one for the \nlongest freefall to project mentor Col. Joe Kittinger.\ufeff",

How have I seen it? By \napps showing me the position of it, so I know its the ISS, and nothing else.\nOther evidence includes books from astronauts and mission controllers. I \nhave many and what is said all links up.\nOther evidence includes video footage, photos, eye witness accounts of \nrocket launches and NASA hardware. Museums have sections dedicated to the \nNASA space programme. All seems a bit weird to dedicate time and money to a \n'mind control program'.\n\nIt all does make sense. Tell me when NASA last lied to the public (with \nevidence).\n\nDo you actually have any solid evidence that Felix's freefall (he made \nseveral high altitude jumps before going to 127852.4ft). and the NASA space \nprogramme is a mind control programme/experiment?\n\nIf they are hoaxes, how come thousands of people worked on them, from chefs \nto engineers, mathematicians to scientists, test pilots, controllers, \nsecurity etc?",

Have you been up there in space? \nHave you been free-falling thus rotating with the earth rather than \norbiting it? Have you been employed by NASA?
