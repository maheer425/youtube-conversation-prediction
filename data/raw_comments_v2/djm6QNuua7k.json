How about instead of telling everyone \nto just go 'get laid,' Buzzfeed needs to stress the practice of Safe Sex. \n Or here's a better idea: instead of telling people to just go out and f**k \nanything that moves, you hint that it's probably better, safer, and more \nconducive to a healthy physical and emotional relationship to actually wait \nto have sex with someone you LOVE.  Giving it up on the first few dates for \neither gender is degrading to your self worth and dangerous for the sexual \nhealth of the entire populace.\ufeff",

Talk about CONSTANT INTERRUPTION? \nAND, my brother is always upstairs! In his room! 3 rooms from my room! \nWHICH IS ALSO UPSTAIRS! My parents would be super suspicious.\n3. I would never have permission to bring a boy into the house. Ever. \nUnless it was my 6-year-old cousin to play Minecraft. Downstairs.\n4. I can barely MASTURBATE in peace! I try to masturbate every once in a \nwhile (once or twice a month, maybe every 2 months) and my bro always \ninterrupts like twice.\n\nBut yeah, I can't stand it. I'm always so horny and as a virgin I have no \nclue what it's like to have a dick sliding in and out of you. I probably \nwon't have sex for years to come (see what I did there? LOL! CUM! xD!). \n*ALTHOUGH,* about 1-3 years ago I did sort of have lesbian sex, but I don't \nknow if you could call it sex. Yeah, we made out a bunch and we tried some \n\"licking\" but it didn't work out too much. It felt gooooood thoooouuugh... \nBut RIGHT as we broke a kiss our other friend came in because she'd just \narrived (I didn't want to write \"came\" there... because LOOOOOL) and then \nwe started listening to music and blablabla girl stuff. And I don't think \nthe \"sex\" worked because neither of us had our periods or even discharge \nreally because we were kind of little. And by little I mean we were like 8 \nor 9. Yeah, our gen is messed up. We have 6 year olds talking about sex \nnow. I'd say we're late bloomers. \n(LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL \nsry long comment)\ufeff",
