Guys, \ntalon is still really strong, he just has the ability to be counter played \nnow, which is something he desperately needed. He just ruined every mid \nthat tried to go against him. \n\nMy Talon Build in terms of item priorities: \nCrystal flasks 3 pots start of the game\nBrutalizer\nTiamat\nRavenous hydra\nGhost blade\nBoots of mobility/counterplay boots ((Tabi, mercs)) \nB.F sword\nIE or BT \nLW or IE or BT ((Depending on enemy team builds armor))\nGA or LW or IE or BT ((there really isn't a need for GA if you're already \nso far ahead you can't be killed)) \n\n\nThat is plenty enough to just show you talon decimates people.\ufeff",

But from I heard from his 1st patch was a nerf on his Q due \nto the fact saying that it \"doing to much damage\" and also nerf his ult due \nto the fact it to strong in \"team fight.\" The second patch I saw on him was \nanother nerf on his Q saying that his Q is still to strong but they lower \nthe cd on his ult. Tbh I feel like Talon is underplay, weak early game, \ngets poke to hard, and his W is weak early game. But in a late game becomes \nreally strong. Don't get me wrong, I love talon because he was my first \nchamp to get a penta in a normal game. But in this meta, he's just \nunderplay and which makes me sad :/\ufeff",

Answering to you +Connor Chan it's less than 5-8 minutes beetween \nevery comment i do, and effort, almost none, since I like the theory of the \ngames, the \"why's?\" of every champion or things in other games. I just read \na lot and put a little logic in these topics.

In my opinion he's fine being \nmana based, just get used to it if the base of your complaining is the bad \nmanagement of mana when you're in laning phase. Remember, your W must \nalways hit your oponnent in order to not waste mana. Oh, last thing, \nneither Zed's Q nor Shen's E can't be spammed; Zed's Q can be used just \nthree times (twice with W on) in less than 4 secs beetween cooldowns. \nShen's E has long cooldown and only returns energy when you hit champions, \nmore champs, more energy; the more the merrier.",
