It's all about a world of order and \ndiscipline, and you play as a defiant, running along the rooftops of this \nfuturistic city, constantly being hunted down by the Hunter. The controls \nare simple, just swipe up to jump, swipe down to slide, and if you stumble \nand slow down too much, the Hunter tazes you, and you lose. If you make it \nto the end, you are greeted with the satisfaction of the Hunter panting and \nbeing a loser. It's all about completion of the levels, with Bonuses \nscattered across the levels, along with sweet tricks which you purchase \nwith the money you find. It's amazing to look at and to play, and I would \nDEFINITELY invest my time in it.\ufeff",
