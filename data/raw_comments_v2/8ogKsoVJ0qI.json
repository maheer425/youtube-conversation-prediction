She \nhad her own milk crate in the passenger seat with a nice towel over it and \nshe would just love to go for a ride. We would go to the farmers market \nwhere she would walk right with me and get little freebies from the sellers \nlike bits of lettuce or a couple of strawberries. One day while she was in \nmy yard  with another hen named \"Redster\" which was a rhode island red they \nwere scratching around together and when I went inside just for a minute to \nmake me a sandwich a damn coyote sprang through my yard and grabbed \nScratchers as I ran outside and chased it down to the river, it had \nscratcher by the neck and I could not catch it as it ran through the river \nand up the bank on the otherside and into the woods. It was simply horrible \nand I still cry about it to this day. It happened in 2007 the last sunday \nof the 5th month. R.I.P. Scratcher you were truly a magnificent bird.\ufeff",
