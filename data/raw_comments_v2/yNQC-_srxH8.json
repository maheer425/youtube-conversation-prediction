Holland) There are times when the only way to \nget from A to C is by way of B. Having grown up in Southern Utah and \nenjoying all the wonders and beauties of Southern Utah and Northern \nArizona, I wanted to introduce my son to that, and I wanted to show him \nplaces that I had seen and enjoyed when I was his age, so his mother packed \na little lunch for us and we took his grandfather's pickup truck and headed \nSouth onto what we call the Old Arizona Strip. Noting that the Sun was \ngoing down we decided we better get back. But we came back to a particular \nfork in the road, really the only one, that at that point was absolutely \nunrecognizable. I asked my son to pray about which road to take, and he \nfelt strongly that we should go to the right, and I did as well, and we \nwent to the right and it was a dead end. We went four or five or six \nhundred yards and it was an absolute dead-end, clearly the wrong road. We \nturned around, came back out, took the other road and clearly the road to \nthe left was the correct road. Somewhere along the way Matt said, \"Dad, why \ndid we feel, after praying about it, that the right road was the proper one \nto take, the correct one to take, and it wasn't?\" And I said, \"I think that \nthe Lord, His wish for us there, and his answer to our prayer was to get us \non the right road as quickly as possible with some reassurance, with some \nunderstanding, that we were on the right road and we didn't have to worry \nabout it, and in this case, the easiest way to do that was to let us go 400 \nyards or 500 yards on the wrong road, and very quickly know, without a \ndoubt, that it was the wrong road, and therefore with equal certainty with \nequal conviction that the other one was the right road.\" I have absolute \ncertain knowledge, perfect knowledge, that God loves us. He is good, He is \nour Father, and He expects us to pray, and trust, and be believing, and not \ngive up, and not panic, and not retreat, and not jump ship, when something \ndoesn't seem to be going just right. We stay in, we keep working, we keep \nbelieving, keep trusting, following that same path and we will live to fall \nin His arms and feel His embrace and hear Him say, \"I told you that it'd be \nokay, I told you it would be all right.\"\ufeff",

I am so grateful you had the courage to speak out. \nI think you have a valid point. It certainly does make more sense to link \nit to scientific reactions . I love to ponder in gratitude about a God who \nworks through scientific and logical ways. Even ways that we have not yet \ncome to understand. One who is filled with a vast amount of knowledge and \nuses that knowledge to form his creations. There isn't a set answer as to \nwhy certain things happen to certain people and what the correlation is to \nthe purpose of the trial. But I know that every living thing was created by \nGod, our heavenly father, who sees perfection in his creations. And \nsometimes our eyes cant possibly see the bigger picture as we are merely a \nspeck in a vast universe. But He loves all of his children and every one is \nuniquely perfect in his eyes. \nI can feel the love you have for your sister through your willingness to \nshare your concern with the world. It sounds like she picked the perfect \nolder brother who would give her the love she would need here on earth. \nBless your family for being courageous human beings.\nSending love and light, \nVanessa ",
