This is one picture of the interaction.\n\nAnother mathematically equal interaction would be ONE electron flying \ntowards a point then turning around and going backwards in time. That is \nthe positron would be an electron going the opposite direction in the \ndimension of time.\n\nThis neatly accounts for the fact that positrons and electrons attract and \nelectrons and electrons repel. The photons bouncing back and forth create \nthe repulsion between electrons. When a positron and electron interact the \nphotons still cause repulsion but time is flowing in reverse from each \nparticle's perspective. Therefore as time moves forward from the other's \nperspective time is going backwards so the particles attract.\n\nThis could mean that all positive particles are moving in one direction of \ntime and all negative particles in the opposite. If a pair of the same \nparticle collide that just means the particle turned around in the time \ndimension. Nothing I have ever heard of disputes this theory and in fact it \nwas in my Standard Model text book by Griffiths (Elementary Particle \nPhysics). It was just proposed as an interesting idea with no proof.\n\nAll Feynman diagrams have the little arrows on them and contrary to what \nMinutephysics said more than just the charge flips in anti-particles. \nIndeed all quantum numbers flip.\n\nThis would mean there are three arrows of time.\n\nThe positive arrow of time for say \"positive charge.\" The negative arrow of \ntime for \"negative charge.\" However, there would be no way to know which \none is which. We would only see the interaction between the two. Finally, \nthe thermodynamic arrow of time that we sense because the future has more \nentropy than the past (more disorder). \n\nThat Feynman diagrams can all be flipped like this is fairly interesting \nbut I haven't heard of any experiments proving anything.",

Wouldn't this mean that \nPhotons create their own particle / anti-particle as a separated yet \ntraveling together \"Packet\"?
