The convex mirror is \nthe outside of the spoon, and the concave mirror is what you use to scoop \nyour soup up.\n\n\nA concave mirror will reflect the light upside-down. (Why you see your face \nthat way.) A convex mirror will make your face appear normal. \n\n\nThis also works with eyeglasses. A concave lens will spread the light rays \napart so they will land on the retina.
