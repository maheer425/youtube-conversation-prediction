I would get really, really annoyed by \nthis thinking that society was succumbing to idiocy, but in reality this is \nsomething that is continuously happening in the development of our \nlanguage. After watching this, I started telling people the origin of their \nbeloved hashtag, and while some people accepted this light heartedly to \nfill otherwise awkward silences, more often it was met with awkward \nsilence. And it just goes to show that all of us in Nerdfighteria exist in \na community of people that fully support and accept each others \nintellectual whims while in the majority of society we are not so lucky. \nPlus that job was awful.\ufeff",
