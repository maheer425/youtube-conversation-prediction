Apart from real chocolate I can only find some that contains \ncocoa fat and vegetable fat. Should you treat that as real or fake? And can \nyou temper white chocolate with the grading-microwave-method? By the way I \nlove your videos and watch them over and over every week! Im a artist and \nshort film director myself so I can see how creative you are and how much \nwork you put into your videos! Im amazed at how you do that every week with \nthree kids! And you're also a very beautiful women! Love from the North\ufeff",
