But I have been \ntrying to keep my mouth shut because of some different opinions. Today it\u2019s \na bit too hard for me to pass by so I created a new channel just for this. \nSee the channel name? :) \nFirst, let me start with the things I agree with you:\n\u201cThe movie (The Lego Movie) is totally enjoyable so I forgive it \neverything.\u201d I would too.\n\u201cI'm just not used to children's movies sharing the message that it's ok \nfor humans to fall in love with organisms outside their own species.\u201d Me \nneither. And let\u2019s not get used to it like some of us do to gay. (Sorry, \nthis is not one of the things we both agree.)\n\u201cThat\u2019s a little weird because 5 year old kids don't get romance.\u201d Totally \nagree! And it just made me happy! \u2018Cause when I saw the comments like \u201cI \nknew I was gay since I was 5\u201d got so many likes, and the video \u201cKids React \nto Gay Marriage\u201d, I was like \u201cWhat in the world??\u201d Now it\u2019s confirmed again \nthat I\u2019m not the one losing my mind. \nI smiled hearing \u201cHenry loved it and at the end he told me he wanted to \nmarry Mummy which I informed him was illegal.\u201d That\u2019s cute and Henry is \nadorable. You are a wonderful parent, of course you inform him. But it made \nme think about those \u201cunqualified parents\u201d. Some of them may even encourage \nkids to think in a wrong way. Lots of times, people say it\u2019s their life. \nBut it\u2019s a society that we all live in. Like when the water gets polluted, \nyou might think you could use a filter on your own, or buy bottled water. \nBut what about when you eat out, and when you buy the veges watered by the \nwater.  It\u2019d be just so hard to escape all. \nPenguins of Madagascar is a great movie, the idea seemed too complex for \nchildren though. Like what would it do when you teach a fifth-grader a high \nschool class? It can cause confusions. I wish there were more good movies \nand books right for kids. Technologies like YouTube might make my wish come \ntrue.\nJust some thoughts. And thank you for making the positive impact on the \ncommunity.\ufeff",
