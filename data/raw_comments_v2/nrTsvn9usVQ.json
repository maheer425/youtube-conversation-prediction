The evidence though is that the fastest propagation is \nachieved through light. The closest concept that could change that (as far \nas I know) is Variable Speed of Light, but VSL does not have corroborating \nevidence nor does it predict observations as we know them today.\n\n*Are you sure our Universe originated with a Big Bang?*\nI'm not a cosmologist but I do understand there are others such as steady \nstate, oscillating, De Sitter,  unending inflation with isolated pockets of \nmass/energy we call universes, some strange forms of digital. Just to name \na few.\nThe best evidence we have indicates that inflation is the most accurate \nunderstanding we have that fits the observed evidence. Now if we uncover \nevidence that contradicts inflation, than another needs to be developed. \nActually if I remember correctly inflation is a correction of the original \nbig bang when CMB did not match up, to me that is the flexibility of \nscience in action.\n\n*It seems you've bought into the mainstream pretty much though.*\nThat's a fairly loaded statement, the best way to reply is that for things \nI'm not an expert at I follow the evidence of the experts. But I don't do \nso blindly, since I have enough understanding to be able to \nnon-scientifically critique and evaluate some concepts.\nFor example, Dark Matter has been given properties which lead to \ninvestigating WIMPS. Well after much research and experiments to detect, \nnot a single conclusive piece of evidence has come forth. I won't write any \nscientific papers but from my perspective WIMPS is a bad hypothesis and \nshould be discarded.\nWhen *mainstream science* provides the preponderance of evidence such as GR \nand the speed of light and their work provides results like GR, Newtonian \nPhysics, QM, then yes I trust the accuracy of mainstream science.\nCan I go beyond that so as not to be dogmatic? By Far! One of my favorite \ntopics is time travel. Since there is no credible evidence of time travel \n(to the past), it really falls into *Not even wrong* as science so far. But \nI particularly enjoy understand and thinking of the implications of Novikov \nSelf-Consistency Principle. The copy concepts I discussed in MWI previously \nwas from discussing time travel and branching parallel universes with a \nscience fiction author.",

But I think the concept attempted in a simplified \nmanner is *does the universe obey mathematics or is mathematics a human \ntool invented to understand what we observe?*\nI find that to be a very important question to answer. If the universe \nobeys mathematics then it implies a logical structuring which opens a wide \nrange of philosophical concepts.\nIf mathematics is just a human tool to understand what we observe (my \npersonal perspective) then there is no such underlying structure or implied \nlogic. The universe just is what it is and we have to figure it out piece \nby piece.\n\nI also don't like how he presents the 3 things that exist, though it's \nsimplified to easily identify classical, relativity and quantum mechanics.\nPersonally (and not necessarily scientifically) I'd classify the 3 things \nwe know exists as:\n1. Energy, he presents it as particles, but particles came from the energy \nof the big bang.\n2. Events that make up measurable interactions and given ability by energy. \nWithout events nothing happens leading to a zero sum universe.\n3. Container for all of the events and energy which allows them. We call \nthis space-time from relativity.\nSo Energy is important in two ways, the formation of matter in the early \nuniverse so that Events interact with mass, and to power those events.\nThe Events is what we observe directly. We don't observe space-time \ndirectly but we observe interactions between masses and apply our tool of \nGR and we understand that demonstrates gravity and it's affect on \nspace-time.\nThe Container (space-time) is to distinguish each event as unique, so we \ncan say this event and that event without confusion. This container is also \nflexible which allows interaction of events over distances and times, \nleading to the concept of cause and effect.\n\nNow our minds are of course part of the universe and as such interact and \nshape events. But the interactions and effects are fairly local, they do \npopulate through the universe but at the speed of light.\nSo my very first interaction when born effects the universe in a small way, \nbut the effects of the that thought or action (crying) has only reached out \n48 light years.\n\nOutside of that range the universe doesn't even know that I exist as a \nperson. 25,000 light years away, the universe doesn't even know that \ncivilized humans exist, that means we haven't even completely effected our \ngalaxy as yet.\nSo what we observe as immediate or quick impact of our thoughts and actions \nare only a local observation and diminishes the further out from us.\nSo our thoughts matter a great deal to us but all together the universe \nprobably doesn't even register them beyond a minuscule effect.",
