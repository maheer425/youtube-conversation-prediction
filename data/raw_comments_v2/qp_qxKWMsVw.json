I have seen and \nread alot about hypercars to judge so shut the fuck up before you can \njudge. Koenigsegg beats the Bugatti Veyrons SS, the P1, the 918, the \nHuayra, you name it. It is perfect in every aspect you use to judge a car, \nit is perfect in handling, acceleration, safety, top speed, fairly \neconomical and has beautiful interior and exterior. The Koenigsegg Agera R \nis the best car of all time. It is perfect in every aspect. It is simply \nthe definition of perfection. The Koenigsegg Agera R in particular is \nperfectly executed. The car is a masterpiece, a work of art that I am \noverly obsessed with. This car is out of this world and no car can simply \ncompare against this brutal 1200 HP horsepower beast. Koenigsegg makes \nother cars in comparison look like nothing. Christian Von Koenigsegg is a \ngenius and has been in an endless pursuit for perfection. This car is \nincredibly stable with very good handling. It is very safe with honeycomb \ncarbon fiber embedded in the body of the car, making it crash absorbent. It \nhas incredible performance, reaching 100 KM in under 3 seconds yet it is \nfairly economical with the most downsized engine ever. It is amazing how a \ntwin turbo V8 can generate an incredible amount of horsepower, It proves \nhow the car is perfectly engineered with a perfect body and engine ratio. I \nalso love how the door opens enabling a simple one step motion, it is the \nonly car with such a complex door opening. I love Christian Von \nKoenigsegg's endless pursuit for perfection. I love how he cares about \nevery detail and makes great innovations for anything he feels is not \nperfectly executed. The car has a strong decisive feel to it. I love the \nidea of the ghost which adds to theme and brutal style of the car. Everyday \nI dream about this car and I keep talking about this beautiful and elegant \ncar with my friends. I have never been truly obsessed with car like that. \nOne day I will go visit the factory in Angelholm Sweden and see this \nfascinating divine car with my own eyes. I hope I see this car before I die \nand be in it one day, the sight of the dashboard and the steering wheel \nalone is breathtaking. To sit in these spacious seats and hold the \nbeautiful steering wheel with its comfortable grip, and hear the beautiful \nsound of these turbo chargers is heaven. I hope I get to see this car one \nday....",
