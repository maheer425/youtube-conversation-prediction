The total number of people killed as a \nresult has been estimated at between 1 and 1.5 million. The starting date \nis conventionally held to be 24 April 1915, the day Ottoman authorities \nrounded up and arrested some 250 Armenian intellectuals and community \nleaders in Constantinople. The genocide was carried out during and after \nWorld War I and implemented in two phases: the wholesale killing of the \nable-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army \nconscripts to forced labor, followed by the deportation of women, children, \nthe elderly and infirm on death marches leading to the Syrian desert. \nDriven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and \nwater and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and massacre. Other \nindigenous and Christian ethnic groups such as the Assyrians and the \nOttoman Greeks were similarly targeted for extermination by the Ottoman \ngovernment, and their treatment is considered by many historians to be part \nof the same genocidal policy. The majority of Armenian diaspora communities \naround the world came into being as a direct result of the genocide.",
