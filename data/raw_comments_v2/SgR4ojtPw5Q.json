I am pretty sure Ben Krasnow of the Applied Science Youtube \nchannel has explained it in some of his videos. The basic method is that \nyou use a solvent which dissolves caffeine but not the other stuff in \ncoffee. Then, you mix the solvent and the coffee, let the solvent dissolve \nthe caffeine, pulling it out of the coffee. Finally, you drain the solvent \noff and then let the residue of solvent evaporate. When they first began to \ndecaffeinate coffee, they used organic solvents like benzene, which can be \ntoxic if not completely removed. Now they use supercritical CO2 (CO2 in a \ntemperature and pressure range where it has some properties of a liquid and \nsome properties of a gas - it can diffuse into the coffee quickly, dissolve \nthe caffeine, and then be sucked back out. Any residue of CO2 just turns to \ngas and leaves when the coffee is brough back to normal atmospheric \npressure.",
