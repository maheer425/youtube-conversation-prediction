There are a few dishes I liked that were not mentioned in the \nvideo but I don't know their names, one is a salad with shrimp, another was \nsimply red pork with garlic and a soup like miso but with noodles, only \nveggies, a little seafood.

I've \nsearched everyone's videos and most of them make it wrong, in my opinion. \nOr if you happen to visit Laos to record someone make it, that would be \ngreat too.
