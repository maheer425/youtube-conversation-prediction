            "text": "I came up with a simpler solution. At first I tried to count them all from \n0 to 999,999 with some simplified formula. I came up with this terrifying \nformula: 45\u00d7100 000+(45\u00d710 000+(45\u00d71 \n000+(45\u00d7100+(45\u00d710+45\u00d710)\u00d710)\u00d710)\u00d710)\u00d710, which is correct, but kinda long \nand not so clever. The next thought a had was trying to think about that \nproblem as a sum of a million numbers (+1 if counting from 0), which should \nbe equal to a million times a number, which is an arithmetic average of \nthose. Well, the biggest number we can get is 9+9+9+9+9+9=54, the smallest \nnumber is 0, so the average is 27. Just multiply it by a million, you get \n27,000,000, then add 1 (1+0+0+0+0+0+0) and you get the final answer - \n27,000,001.\nSo the basic formula for this problem is \u03a3d(a-1)*a/2+1, where a is the \nrequired number (1,000,000 in this case) and \u03a3d(x) is a digit sum of x\ufeff",

When adding the pairs, there is no \ncarrying from one power of 10 to the next, so adding the pairs together \nhappens to result in the same sum of digits.  i.e.  (9+9+9+9+9+9) + 0 = 54, \n(9+9+9+9+9+8) + 1 = 54,...,(6+5+4+3+2+1) + (3+4+5+6+7+8) = 54, etc.  But \nwhat if we use a different number than 999,999?  Such as 999,995?  It \nshould result in the previous problem's answer, 27,000,000 (ignoring the 1 \nfrom 1,000,000), less the sums of the digits of the four missing numbers. \n 27,000,000 - 54 - 53 - 52 - 51 = 26,999,790.  But if we use the pairing \nmethod of [(0+999,995),(1+999,994),(2+999,993)...(499,997+499,998)], we \nhave 499,998 pairs.  The digits of 999,995 add up to 50.  By this method we \nshould multiply the number of pairs by the sum of the digits of their sums, \nso 499,998 * 50 = 24,999,900, which is considerably less.  The problem is \nthat while the sum of the digits of the sum of pairs is the same as the sum \nof the sums of the digits of the pairs in some cases, e.g. \n[(9+9+9+9+2)+(3)] = 50, it is not the same for other pairs. e.g. \n[(9+9+9+9+8+7)+(8)] = 59.  In this example, when you use the \"trick\" to \ndetermine the sum of the digits of the pair 999,987 and 8, you get 50 (just \nlike every pair), when in actuality their sum is 59, so you've lost 9 from \nyour total for that pair.  It appears that this method only works for \nnumbers that are all 9's or have one non-9 number at the beginning followed \nby all 9's, like 499,999.  Anytime your pairs every involve \"carrying the \none\" when you add them together, you're losing digits.\ufeff",

Imagine \nthe numbers 0 through 999,999 listed in a huge column, one number per line, \nwith the digits lined up evenly.  You can imagine padding zeroes at the \nbeginning of the first 99,999 numbers for clarity.  For instance, 0 would \nbe written as 000000, 1 would be written as 000001, etc.  Well, in each \ncolumn as you go down the list, you are cycling through the digits 0-9.  \nSome columns cycle more rapidly (like the ones column and tens column), and \nsome columns cycle very slowly (like the ten thousands column and the \nhundred thousands column).  BUT, no column favors one digit over any other \ndigit.  Whether a column cycles quickly or slowly, every digit is found \nwithin it just as often as any other digit.  So, in any column, 10% of the \ndigits are 0, 10% of the digits are 1, 10% of the digits are 2, 10% of the \ndigits are 3, etc.  Therefore, with one million numbers used (0 - 999,999), \nin each column there are 100,000 of each digit.  100,000 * \n(0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9) = 100,000 * 45 = 4,500,000.  6 (columns) * 4,500,000 \n= 27,000,000.  Then, of course, add in the digit sum of 1 from 1,000,000 -- \nsince we only went to 999,999 --, and you get 27,000,001.  This made more \nsense to me.\ufeff",

(5 digits can go to 1st place, 4 digits in the 2nd place, 3 digits in \nthe 3rd place and so on giving 5*4*3*2*1=5! such numbers). Took me 2-3 \nseconds.\nThen i considered two valid 5 digit numbers, example (21435 and 45231) or \n(12345 and 54321) whose sum yielded 66666. Thus every 5 digit number had a \ncompliment number and their sum yielded 66666. There were 5!/2 such pairs \nand so the sum was 66666*(5!/2).\nThis video refreshed this memory of mine and made me feel very nostalgic. \nIt made me feel that i am no less than Gauss.

At 05:50 You said, \"If all \nthose pairs equal the same thing we can now add these digits\" but that is \nnot true, the sum of digits does not necessary equal the sum of the actual \nnumbers. So lets take an example. 100 is equal 50+50, it is also equal 1 + \n99, but when you add the digits of both sums. 5+0+5+0 you get  10 , but \nwhen you add 1 + 9 + 9 you get 19. 100 is also equal to \n9+9+9+9+9+9+9+9+9+19 (which digits sums to 91). In other words are alot of \nwhole numbers that sums to a given value, however the sum of each sum's \ndigit does not necessary equal. This means when you get the 999999  pairs \nand multiplied by half a million, you are only summing the digits 9. If you \ndone that with by starting from a 1 instead of a zero , 1000001 multiplied \nby half a million, you will get a totally different result (much lesser \nthough cuz you are summing 1s and 0s) \ufeff",
