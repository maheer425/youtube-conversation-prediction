I mustve been tired or drunk when I made \nthat comment lol ;)\nAnd I agree 100% that it looks better. Digital looks 'sharp' or something? \nCant put the right word on it. Film just looks better. Im glad certain \ndirectors are trying to keep it, like Quentin Tarantino. He is filming his \nnew movie, the Hateful Eight, in 70mm. Which I believe is the same that \nLawrence of Arabia was filmed in! The super wide screen film captures \ncinematography better imo.\nAnyway, my original comment wasnt meant to discuss the merits of film vs \ndigital, just trying to understand what the OP meant by 'image quality is \ngreat for a film of its time' (which I still dont understand what he means \nby that)....
