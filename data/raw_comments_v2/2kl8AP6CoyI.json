We had our GTI for $27k out the door with DSG, 18\" \noptional wheels, and navigation (basically all you'd need in a GTI) back \nwhen the base price was $2k less than the current generation, and it's the \n4-door model. If you let yourself get completely ripped off by adding \nabsolutely every last bit of options and accessories, then that's your \nproblem. The amount of options these days are absolutely ridiculous and \nmostly unnecessary. That's also why when we recently ordered our Range \nRover Sport Supercharged to replace our old and tired family SUV, we \nskipped the Autobiography trim and that ridiculous $6k sound system. In the \nend you'd get the same amount of enjoyment, but at least you wouldn't be \nthrowing your car around corners knowing you spent $100 on some shiny valve \nstem caps or $500 for an iPod cable when you can just use Bluetooth. I \nguarantee you with $42k, you'd be able to get a decently equipped Golf R \nout the door. \n\nAs for mechanical problems, Japanese cars these days are getting up there \nwhen it comes to cost of maintenance and/or repairs when needed. If you go \nto a shop, you'll get charged out the ass for labor no matter what you \ndrive, and parts for newer Japanese cars aren't exactly cheap. If you want \nJapanese cars with low cost replacement parts, you basically have to pick \nthe most common models like Civic, Corolla, Accord, Camry, etc. My Subaru \nhasn't been exactly cheap compared to the GTI, which turned out to be a \nvery accessible car if you're mechanically inclined to do maintenance \nyourself instead of getting raped by stealers. But then again, I'm merely \nspeaking from personal experience. If you wish to stick with Honda or \nToyota, no one is forcing you to do otherwise.",

Then there are those who want to know about why it's \nan all round car.  Finally those asking about it's practicality.\n\nI think we're at the melding point between these segments;  if you just \nwant utilitarianism, then the Golf VII is for you.  If you want the \nperformance and the heritage; Golf GTI VII.  If  you want the ultimate \nperformance and the heritage; Golf R VII.\n\nSo now it's possible (IMHO) to review the car as a GTI...purely for GTI \nenthusiasts...and hearken back to the 70's version...but remembering that \nthe world is a different place now.  We need the airbags, ABS, traction \ncontrol, stability, crash sustainability, fuel economy.\ufeff",

Still lots to love in the new WRX from the FA Turbo motor \n(makes the STI seem silly with its non-VVTi EJ motor), new 6-speed (even \nthough it makes it slower it's finally a quality shifting unit), to a \nchassis that hands out .96g.\n\nI'd still buy a GTi myself but I don't really think they're comparable cars \nuntil Subaru pulls their head out and makes either a Wagon variant or a new \nsmaller Imprezza replacement.

Hood here in Oregon (daily \ncommute: 1500-6700ft in 2.5miles on a 2-lane FS road... with a 12% grade at \none point).  2wd and I got to work every day with 4wds off the road \neverywhere. VW's work REAL well in the snow,  but yeah... Bad drivers are \nbad drivers and struggle on all surfaces.\n\nNot knocking Scoobys either, I love he WRX too, just saying.  The GTi's \nchassis is my favorite (I've been building MK1 and 2 cars for years) but I \nlove rallying at heart and the WRX/Scoobys are just plain staple cars here \nin the NW on and off the track.  Two great cars and the GTi's no more \n\"practical\" as the WRX wagon is quite good in that department as well.  I \nwill say the GTi has the looks though, Subaru has gone \"funky\" as of late. \n They grow on me, but the last gen and the new one have both made me kinda \ngo \"really???\" at first viewing...",
