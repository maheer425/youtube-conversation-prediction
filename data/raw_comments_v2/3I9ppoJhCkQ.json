It set up in like 2 minutes! No word of a lie, as we say \nhere in the East! \nWell we still have those 150 cm snow banks but, the temps are moderating, \nthe Canada geese are returning and the chickadees are starting to nest, so, \nin no time those snow banks will be gone and the daffodils will be up.
