I cooked the bacon and onions separately \nwhile I brought my milk and chicken broth to a boil. Also I cooked the \npotatoes for an hour at 425 F, and then I cut them in to quarters and the \nskin came right off and I didnt have to peel them or wait for them to cook \nin the soup, ITS SO MUCH EASIER! After the milk mixture came to a boil I \nmashed the potatoes a little because I wanted my soup to still have chunks \nbut be a little thicker. Then i added the bacon and sour cream and what \nnot.
