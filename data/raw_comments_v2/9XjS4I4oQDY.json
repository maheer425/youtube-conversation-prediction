Well they wrong there are many things that can \ntravel far above the light speed. The human imagination and fantasy can \ntravel to the other end of the known and unknown universe in realtime. The \nspeed limit is the resistance. When you try to do something no matter what \nthere is always a counter force which is oposite to your intentions and \nactions and its called resistance. Remove the resistance and you can go \nwhenever you want in realtime. For me space and time are two diferent \ncomponents and not one whole thing. There is space and there is time, no \nspacetime. The space is place, the time is the things which happen on this \nplace for given period. To travel back in time is not possible, not \npossible to travel to the future as well. Because its like clicking of \nbrowser back/forward button. If you click back you simpy replay the old \nthings in past again in the present. The past has unlimited possibilities \nas well as the future so basicly the best thing you could do is replay one \npossibility.\nI think that if you travel faster than light this wil not help you to slow \ndown the time or any manuplation of the time. Now back to my theory if you \ntravel faster this not makes you slow down the time, the only option for \nyou is to not exist in the space for period of time and then you reapear \nagain. Parallel universe, another world,dimension. According to mr Koku if \nyou have two atoms and you separate them no matter how much is the distance \nbetween them if you change polarity of the atom the other atom changes to \nthe oposite instantly. So thats faster than light too. According to some \nextreme theories the universe is based on thoughts and minds, whatever you \nthink in your fantasy is already hapening somewhere. Others claim that \nthere are alien races such pleadians which travel by thoughs. There are not \nengines,warp bubles,hyperspace - just thoughts and amplifiers.

            "text": "Here is a good way to look at how our current understanding of physics can \nbe at its core fundamentally wrong yet still hold a lot of truth. Lets just \nthink how much we have accumulated in knowledge since the human race \nstarted to study physics. How far we have gone and how much we have \nadvanced, yet in the scale of time and space, just how much time have we \nreally had to study physics? Relitive to how long ago the universe was \nborn, when was our galaxy created, then how much later our planet was born, \nthen how much longer we took to evolve into the human race on this planet, \nthen how much more time it took for the age of reason to take place and \nfinally allowed ourselves the ability to finally study physics. When we put \nthe amount of time we have studied physics into scale with how long we have \nbeen around as the human race and then to further put all of this into \nscale with the age of our planet, galaxy, universe! I think its safe to say \nour understanding of physics is equivalent to a baby who was just born. \nMany can try and argue about this but I think its clear our current \nknowledge of physics is barely at its infancy. Any grounded, logical \nphysicist would agree and admit that while we hold a great deal of \nunderstanding towards physics there is far more we don't understand at all \nand even more for which we are not even aware exist yet simply because we \njust don't have the knowledge yet. So should we be so surprise if later on \nwe do find out there maybe be something faster than light? Who knows! there \nmay even be multiple types of particals yet to be discovered who are in \nanother level beyond light! Thats the beauty of science after all right \nguys! to study the wonders and to understand our universe! Anyone who truly \nbelieves that our current understanding of physics so far is fundamentally \ncorrect is dead wrong, we are merely aware of just one grain of sand in an \noverwhelming beach of knowledge yet to be acquired. So much incredible vast \namount of knowledge just waiting to be discovered! I can only imagine 1,000 \nyears from now how physicist will look back at our time and understand how \nmuch we had wrong, simply because the knowledge had not been discovered or \nthe technology just didn't exist yet.\ufeff",
