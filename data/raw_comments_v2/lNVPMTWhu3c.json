It then becomes too soft to incorporate any \nair into because it has no structure (its too soft for buttercream, cake \nbatter, cookie dough, etc.). Once you add the icing sugar, it breaks and \nthe fat is just mixing around with clumpy sugar. Adding milk will only make \nthis worse. I suggest taking your butter out just 30 minutes - 1 hour ahead \nof time. If you've sieved your icing sugar, it should be fine enough to do \nthe job. You also shouldn't mix the buttercream too long. If you beat the \nproteins in butter too long, they will seize and force water out of the \nmixture. Mix for only the recommended amount of time.",
