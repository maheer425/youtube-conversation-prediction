But it's my favorite because I've \nread the books, because I've watched the international performances (and to \nthis date, no one is a better musical actress than Willemijn Verkaik for me \nand I wouldn't know her if it wasn't for Wicked), because I relate way more \nto all the characters than in any other play I've seen and loved. The music \nand theatricality of it might be more \"mainstream\" and pop and all, but the \nheart of it is what makes it great for musical nerds and non nerds, so no \nneed for anyone to be \"shamed\" for liking it.\ufeff",
