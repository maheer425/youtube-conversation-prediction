Some dogs hear their name so often, especially if they \nmisbehave, that they don't actually know that is their name - they just end \nup thinking it's a word you happen to say a lot. Later, you can switch back \nto their actual name and retrain them to know BOTH names are theirs. \nMy dog did not respond to her name all the time as a puppy and she ended up \ngetting a lot of nicknames, but eventually she learned them all to be hers. \nWe also talked to her with a high voice so that distinguished her from the \nrest of the family. She learned to pay attention anytime we raised the \npitch of our voices. Poodles are notoriously easy to train though, so that \ncould have played a major part. Just take your time and be patient, your \npup will learn eventually. I had my dog for 13 years, so if you have any \nmore questions I will try to help. Good luck! ",

They will learn not to pull on the leash anymore and to \nalways stay very close to you. This tutorial says to walk quickly with a \npuppy because they will move fast. Definitely not! Teach your puppy that \nyou lead, not them! All of this is so inaccurate! ",
