He treads carefully so as to not start any new wars or \nhuge falling outs with other countries (in fact, he actually managed to \n*improve* foreign relations with a lot of nations who hated us formerly), \nhe did his best to recall troops and he deployed them sparingly only when \nnecessary, and he reformed several systems, including healthcare, that are \nmore beneficial to the common public rather than just the top 10 or 20 \npercent.\nAnd he managed to do that after being handed a country with a popped \neconomy.\n\nSo honestly, I'm impressed with some things he has done, and I'm not \nparticularly angry or disappointed with anything else he's done. He was \ngood. He's still a politician and he still does unsavory, politician-y \nthings, but all politicians do that. For what he was, he was good.\nI get the feeling that the people who hate him hardcore don't really have a \ngood reason to do so.",
