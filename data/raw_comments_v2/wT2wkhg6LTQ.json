What is it you like to eat daily? - you \nsell those.\nYou do not have to start selling inside in a building: go to a market where \nyou sell stuff outside and outdoors. Buy a stand and a table to sell your \nstuff. And if your desperate, sell them at your home. But maybe you need a \nlawful license or something or a selling permit to start selling some \nreally useful food. I've seen people in carts selling stuff and while they \ntravel inside subway stations and on board trains... So...\n\nThere's a fish can that is the best fish can I ever eaten in my life so far \ncalled: Rugen Fisch - Smoked Herring Fillets - with vegetable oil and own \njuice (rugenfisch.de).\n\nEating these with delicious bread and with a fork and they are ready to be \neaten. Some long looking greenish onions are also good while eating these \nfish can...\n\nAnd don't invest in things that you don't like using, because if you don't \nlike it - it's mostly likely others don't like it either. If you know \nthat's overall good, it will sell and probably run out of stock, too. Then \nyou scale it from 1 to 10 (1 is very bad to 10 excellent). Sell the as many \n9's and 10's as you can, and avoid the 4s and belowers...\n\nI could go on and on, but I will end it here for now... I overall was happy \nthat I typed these in... You think for yourself now, guys... And rely on \nGod Jesus Christ to make your prayers come true... Amen.",

I don't get it. You don't want to \nbe held accountable for what you've said? Sorry, I have to do it:\n\n\"But i don't care about balance. If a car sounds better and looks better \nand feels better, i want it more.\"\n\nThe very fact that you said that you don't care about balance says A LOT \nabout the depth of knowledge and enthusiasm you have for cars. You don't \ncare about balance, but you care about how the car feels? I'm not \nunderstanding you. Are you talking about how a car's sheet metal feels to \nyour touch? ",
