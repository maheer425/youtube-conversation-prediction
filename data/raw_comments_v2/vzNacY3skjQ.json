            "text": "Guys please try to avoid using these methods, especially the lip suction \none. It is so dangerous, people have blown blood vessels in their lips from \nit and also its so easy to gt massive bruises from this (I did). The other \nmethods are saver but just know that you are beautiful the way you are. You \nshouldn't have to scrape at your lips with a toothbrush to fit in with \nsociety's obsession with big lips!
