There was enormous \npressure from the UN to decolonize so the countries with colonies let go on \nmost it's colonies extremely quickly. What that did not allow them to do \nwas decolonize in a way to provide for a stable and secure government in \neach colony, and to settle disputes in a more peaceful manner than if say \neach independent country had an army and fought against each other, the \ncolonizers army made sure that no one from either side of a dispute fought \neach other, and each side had to come peacefully to accept a solution. They \nalso would have been able to build modern infrastructure, like wells, \nhospitals, running water, schools, roads, railways, and utilities. This \nwould have made coups less likely, dictators not being able to rise as \neasily because the government in place had experience and knowledge of how \nto peacefully and fairly run a country, and there being checks against the \nmilitary. When the British had to leave Nigeria, only a dozen or so people \nhad college degrees. That is not enough to run a country well. The \ncolonizers also could have used a system like the Brits with their \ndominions. The countries have some autonomy at first, then as they get \nexperience governing, they get some more autonomy, and then more as they \nprove they will not use their autonomy to do things like fight other \ncountries for any reason other than to glorify a prime minister, or change \ntheir constitution to make say women in the 1960s not able to vote. Then \nfinally, once the country in question has enough experience, infrastructure \nand development, and has adopted human rights treaties and other needed \ntreaties, like membership into the UN, or between themselves and \nneighbouring countries over common issues, they can have a patriated \nconstitution. \ufeff",

            "text": "Hi John and/or Hank,\nI was just wondering if you could make a video on the current situation in \nMexico, with the war against the cartels and the violence that was \ngenerated from that, especially in border cities. My family is from Ciudad \nJuarez, and we live in El Paso. Juarez was named the most violent city in \nthe world in 2010 (I may be wrong on the year, but that is when the \nviolence was at its worst), while El Paso is considered the safest big city \nin the United States. With Latinos being one of the largest minorities, \nit's so relevant to people in the US, but its constantly ignored in \nmainstream media. It's like you say, that people like a simple narrative \nwhen it comes to the news but this situation is complex and multifaceted \nand so important that it deserves attention, and the United States plays a \npart just as much as Mexico and other Latin American countries in this \nissue, and instead of treating drug abuse as the public health issue that \nit is, it's criminalized. Ciudad Juarez used to be a city full of life and \ncolor, but after 2006 it changed so drastically, so quickly. I don't know, \nI'm just tired of hearing this issue be ignored, when clearly drugs are so \ningrained in our society, and I'm tired of hearing about a relative's \nrelative being murdered. Mexico's gotten a bad rep because of this, but the \nincredible resilience of our people and culture continues to remind me of \nthe hope that there is to be had.\nI really hope that you read this, and help raise awareness for the \nthousands who have died as a result of the drug war. I thank you so much \nfor your awesomeness, which you never forget to be. \ufeff",

If you have very little idea of what \nindependence entails and are subsequently forced to take up a form of rule \nwhere historically there has been no single leader of an area much greater \nthan what a tribe can control a centralised government can't work. \nIndependence left the majority of African \"states\" with very little way of \ndealing with their independence (the voting population are at the mercy of \ntheir politicians who tell them who to vote for and give them no better \nreason than claiming it is their right to rule the country). This worked \nwell enough when the rulers had limited resources and power due to the size \nof the land and the number of people they ruled. Genocide just couldn't \nhappen because it was a physical impossibility, but then give those same \nmen much more resources, land and people to rule over and the whole way \nthey think has to change, but it doesn't. They continue to think of the \ninterests of their tribe and consider outsiders a threat, which they are \nbecause all the many groups of outsiders believe that they are superior. So \nwhat do humans do when encountering a threat? They exterminate it. Thus we \nhave numerous instances of genocide since African states gained their \nindependence. So what's the solution? Education. Africans need to begin to \nsee themselves as not members of tribes but of \"countries\" and this can \nonly happen when there is an ideological shift and this is what education \nneeds to achieve. Will this happen? Not while the \"countries\" face so much \nturmoil, and as you can see we have a catch 22 situation.
