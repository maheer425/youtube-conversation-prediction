People in their youth and middle ages are at the age \nwhere they want to find a partner to settle down with so they care more for \ntheir appearance to find a mate. It's just human nature, it has nothing to \ndo with society whatsoever. This is just another cheesy video a bunch of \nfilm students made to cash in on the various similar videos made about body \nimage. The film is sponsored by a cosmetics company - if you really think \nthey give a shit about the \"message\" they're sending then you're an idiot. \nI agree that you should embrace yourself but wanting to be more handsome or \nbeautiful is natural.\ufeff",
