By making an appearance on the \nEllen Show your targeting women, who by the way make up an majority of \nvoters, and your \"putting them on your side\" or at least trying to persuade \nthem to be on you side. Come election time for what ever you're running \nfor; and young adults and women make up the majority of votes and you win! \n\nRemember when Obama first made it into office. There was a big ordeal about \nOprah helping Obama win by all her endorsement.

Forbes reports that in California, Obamacare is expected to \nincrease individual health insurance premiums by up to 146 percent. One of \nthe most serious flaws with Obamacare is that its blizzard of regulations \nand mandates drives up the cost of insurance for people who buy it on their \nown. Obama\u2019s national security strategy is confusing at best and weak at \nworst, causing a vacuum in leadership which land-hungry leaders like Putin \nare more than happy to fill. The IRS targeting of conservative groups has \nbeen particularly damaging, with 76 percent of voters supporting the \nappointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the scandal, and a \nseries of Congressional hearings putting the Obama administration on the \nspot. In the aftermath of the barbaric killing of Ambassador Stevens and \nthree other Americans on September 11, 2012 at the hands of al-Qaeda linked \nIslamist militants, serious questions have arisen over the Administration's \nhandling of the crises. Also, veteran reporters such as Bob Woodward, one \nof two journalists who broke the Watergate scandal, have found themselves \non the sharp end of the White House\u2019s boot after publishing unflattering \nstories. Woodward was warned earlier this year by a senior White House \nofficial that he would \u201cregret\u201d his remarks about the president\u2019s handling \nof the sequester issue.
