In this scenario, would you want to scream and wave \nyour arms saying \"hey, I'm here, look at me!\" for no reason? Sure, there \ncould be someone friendly looking for you (a rescue team or, in the context \nof the subject, a good-hearted civilization that could help us solve some \nof our problems) but I believe that it's more likely that you will catch \nthe attention of a hostile creature looking for easy prey.
