Since dark matter has a gravitational influence, then when they \ngo past a planet they pull it with them. Since there is more dark matter \nthan regular matter, the dark matter has many \"atoms\" or units that every \ntime one passes a planet, there are so many that follow it that it speeds \nup.

You don't \nneed blue shift to have universal collapse. If a super black hole is out of \nour sight the objects (galaxies) would be moving faster towards it. Objects \nfurther away moving slower would see that as red shift and objects further \naway from that moving slower would also show red shift. Think of water \ngoing down a bathtub drain. You would only see blue shift in a collapsing \nuniverse from a stationary point inside the super black hole. Ok, so how do \nwe show expansion instead of collapse? measure the lateral distance of two \ngalaxies over time from one another and see if they spread wider apart \n(expansion), of pull closer together ( contraction towards a point). the \nspeed they are moving away from us is irrelevant. If we are collapsing into \na super black hole then dark matter is no longer needed to explain outer \ngalaxy acceleration, simple mundane physical laws explain everything fine.\ufeff",

When I was younger and learned about dark \nenergy, I couldn't wrap my head around it, but I looked across the room at \na bottle of hand sanitizer when I noticed all of those tiny bubbles inside \nthe clear gel. Those same bubbles were an outcome of an event or action. \nThey could have come from the shaking in shipping, maybe from the gel being \ndeposited into the bottle, or maybe even me shaking it. Whatever it was, it \nwas there and was now in existence. It didn't change the state of the gel \nor make it deplete any faster; it was just pointless scars of an old \npointless action. They float in the middle of something else being held \ntogether by the gel while all was bound inside of that bottle. believe the \nsame principles apply to dark matter and dark energy along with the rest of \nthe universe. In a universe filled with absolutely nothing, we are the the \nlittle bit of something. Maybe it's because two universes clashed at one \npoint, or maybe we are the universe that is \"just this way\" in the endless \namounts of universes in the infinite playground of space.
