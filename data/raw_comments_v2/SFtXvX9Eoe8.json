Check out this excerpt from Martin Luther's book \"on the jews \nand their lies\":\n\n\"What then shall we Christians do with this damned, rejected race of Jews? \nSince they live among us, we dare not tolerate their conduct, now that we \nare aware of their lying and reviling and blaspheming. If we do, we become \nsharers in their lies, cursing and blasphemy. Thus we cannot extinguish the \nunquenchable fire of divine wrath, of which the prophets speak, nor can we \nconvert the Jews. With prayer and the fear of God we must pratice a sharp \nmercy to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames. \nWe dare not avenge ourselves. Vengenance a thousand times worse than we \ncould wish them already has them by the throat. I shall give you my sincere \nadvice: \n\nFirst to set fire to their synagogues or schools and to bury and cover with \ndirt whatever will not burn, so that no man will ever again see a stone or \ncinder of them. This is to be done in honor of our Lord and of Christendom, \nso that God might see that we are Christians, and do not condone or \nknowingly tolerate such public lying, cursing, and blaspheming of his Son \nand of his Christians. For whatever we tolerated in the past \nunknowingly\u2014and I myself was unaware of it\u2014will be pardoned by God. But if \nwe, now that we are informed, were to protect and shield such a house for \nthe Jews, existing right before our very nose, in which they lie about, \nblaspheme, curse, vilify, and defame Christ and us (as was heard above), it \nwould be the same as if we were doing all this and even worse ourselves, as \nwe very well know. \n\nSecond, I advise that their houses also be razed and destroyed. For they \npursue in them the same aims as in their synagogues. Instead they might be \nlodged under a roof or in a barn, like the gypsies. This will bring home to \nthem that they are not masters in our country, as they boast, but that they \nare living in exile and in captivity, as they incessantly wail and lament \nabout us before God.\n\nThird, I advise that all their prayer books and Talmudic writings, in which \nsuch idolatry, lies, cursing and blasphemy are taught, be taken from them. \n. . .\n\nFourth, I advise that their rabbis be forbidden to teach henceforth on pain \nof loss of life and limb. For they have justly forfeited the right to such \nan office by holding the poor Jews captive with the saying of Moses \n(Deuternomy 17 [:10 ff.]) in which he commands them to obey their teachers \non penalty of death, although Moses clearly adds: \"what they teach you in \naccord with the Law of the Lord.\" Those villains ignore that. They wantonly \nemploy the poor people's obedience contrary to the law of the Lord and \ninfuse them with this poison, cursing, and blasphemy. In the same way the \npope also held us captive with the declaration in Matthew 16 {:18], \"You \nare Peter,\" etc, inducing us to believe all the lies and deceptions that \nissued from his devilish mind. He did not teach in accord with the Word of \nGod, and therefore he forfeited the righ to teach. \n\nFifth, I advise that safe-conduct on the highways be abolished completely \nfor the Jews. For they have no business in the countryside, since they are \nnot lords, officials, tradesmen, or the like. Let they stay at home. . . If \nyou princes and nobles do not close the road legally to such exploiters, \nthen some troop ought to ride against them, for they will learn from this \npamphlet what the Jews are and how to handle them and that they ought not \nto be protected. You ought not, you cannot protect them, unless in the eyes \nof God you want to share all their abomination. \n\nSixth, I advise that usury be prohibited to them, and that all cash and \ntreasure of silver and gold be taken from them and put aside for \nsafekeeping. The reason for such a measure is that, as said above, they \nhave no other means of earning a livelihood than usury, and by it they have \nstolen and robbed from us all they possess. Such money should now be used \nin no other way than the following: Whenever a Jew is sincerely converted, \nhe should be handed one hundred, two hundred, or three hundred florins, as \npersonal circumstances may suggest. With this he could set himself up in \nsome occupation for the support of his poor wife and children, and the \nmaintenance of the old or feeble. For such evil gains are cursed if they \nare not put to use with God's blessing in a good and worthy cause. \n\nSeventh, I commend putting a flail, an ax, a hoe, a spade, a distaff, or a \nspindle into the hands of young, strong Jews and Jewesses and letting them \nearn their bread in the sweat of their brow, as was imposed on the children \nof Adam (Gen 3[:19]). For it is not fitting that they should let us \naccursed Goyim toil in the sweat of our faces while they, the holy people, \nidle away their time behind the stove, feasting and farting, and on top of \nall, boasting blasphemously of their lordship over the Christians by means \nof our sweat. No, one should toss out these lazy rogues by the seat of \ntheir pants.\"\n\nIf that's not point for point the very fucking blueprint for the Nazi's \n\"Endl\u00f6sung\", I don't know what is...",
