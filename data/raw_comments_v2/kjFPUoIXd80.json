This is getting old. \n\nPeople try to point the finger at one specific group, you're just grasping \nfor straws. \n\nFirst of all, immigration is undoubtedly an indicator of wild-strain \ndiseases being brought across the borders. Since I was a child, it has more \nthan doubled. \n\nSecondly, the trend from the early 20th century till the first \nsingle-strain vaccine was introduced was showing a decline. People \nattempting to form a correlation between vaccines and a decline that \nhappened literally decades prior to its introduction are pretty desperate \nin their attempt to defend vaccines. \n\nYet oddly enough, we have stuff like this \nhttp://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/189/Supplement_1/S17.full.pdf  \n\n\"Measles case fatality decreased from 21 deaths/1000 reported\ncases in 1911\u20131912 to !1 death/1000 in 1953\u2013\n1962. This improvement in survival of people infected\nwith measles virus presumably resulted from improved\nnutrition and medical care, especially the availability of\nnewly discovered antibiotics to treat many of the bacterial\ncomplications of measles.\"\n\nSame can be applicable to many other ailments that can quite honestly be \nhandled with even the most minimal of additional nutrient supplementation. \n\nIf you want to trust the most money-hungry industry on the planet, by all \nmeans, vaccinate your child and hope they won't end up as one of the \nunlucky ones experiencing serious adverse reactions. I look at vaccines as \nany other pharmaceutical. Are people dropping dead left and right from \ntaking such-and-such drug? No. Should it be mandatory that I take \nsuch-and-such drug for blankety-blank? No. \n\nThere are alternatives out to defend, and help you recover from disease. \nYou don't need to inject yourselves with synthetics that carry the \npotential to harm rather than \"do good.\" \n\nIf you'd like to argue the effectiveness of alternative treatments versus \nthat of the modern medical industry, by all means, I have quite literally \nthousands of testimonials to draw from and plenty of MD's and a few \nbiochemists/pharmacists that would tend to disagree with your stance. \ufeff",

See, much of the damage being \nallegedly caused by vaccines could be further ruled out by having a simple \nblood test prior to the initiation of vaccination. But they'd rather not do \nthat -- they'd rather not take into account the well-known growing immune \nand auto-immune disorders (which, like autism spectrum, aren't understood \nby medicine). Why? Isn't medicine supposed to err on the side of caution \nand preservation of health. If a test is available (and it is), why \nshouldn't that be done to determine the appropriate schedule and \nadministration of a lifetime of important vaccinations and other \nmedications? Also, herd immunity through vaccination is largely mythical -- \nbased on the reality of the timeframe he used in discussing the disease's \neradication. So, we got here (as he asked) by medical science believing the \nvariables involved in a healthy cross section of the population are \nunchanged in the last 50 years. But that rise in immune and auto-immune \nconditions happened in that time period (among other new conditions), and \nthere's little medical understanding of them. The discussion becomes the \nbig misunderstanding at this same point in every case -- at the end of the \nvideo, it's condescend condescend condescend... we who trust science (that \nadmittedly doesn't know the variables in ASD as one example) are so above \nyou... condescend condescend.
