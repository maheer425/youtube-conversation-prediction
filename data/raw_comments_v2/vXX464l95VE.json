Didn't know it was \ncreated by Rahul Dev Burman. Knew it is Hindi, that's all. Both the \nversions by Lata and Kishore are sweet. The lady Sadhana is so sweet I wish \nI had married her in her young age, though she is much elder than me!. She \nrepresents the womanhood I worship. What sweetness, what dignity, what lean \nfigure...No words of praise are enough for this. Great! ",
