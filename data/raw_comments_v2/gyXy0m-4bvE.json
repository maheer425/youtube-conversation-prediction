It was my first time ever seeing a kpop group/idol in \nperson. I was so emotional. They threw an amazing show! It is seriously a \nmoment that I cannot forget. To be honest, I never  thought the first group \nthat I would ever see in person would be NU'EST. Plus I found out about \ntheir free concert last minute! It was crazy. haha I still can't get over \nit, I keep re-watching the videos I filmed over and over again. I wished I \ngot see them longer. Seeing them live is a whole new experience now I love \nthem even more! <3 I will always support NU'EST!\ufeff",

I wasn't into K-Pop then, so I didn't even know this was in Korean \nhahaha and I searched the only part I knew: Jackpot. Of course, it didn't \nhelp at all and I just gave up. Now, I became a fan of so many groups, \nbecause I have known K-Pop from watching so many K-dramas. I don't really \nlisten to Korean songs, unless they're really popular or from groups I am a \nbig fan of. Now, I was re-watching MYNAME's Message when I saw this song in \nthe recommendations. Funny enough, since from of ALL the groups I am a fan \nof (a billion), I don't even know the members of NU'EST. But I did know \nthat Face was a popular song of theirs, so I thought, \"Why not listen to \nit?\"\n\nand then BAM\n\nI slammed my face onto my desk and wallowed in mixed emotions. This was the \ndang song I have been trying to find for three years. It isn't even called \n\"Jackpot\" mwahahahaaaaa (yes, I know b2st's)\n\nI pity myself. I experienced the EXACT thing with Hot Issue (I even \ncommented on its MV and people said they experienced the same thing). This \njust goes to show the pressing issue we can all relate to of hearing a song \nin a foreign language but only being able to search its English lyrics XD\ufeff",
