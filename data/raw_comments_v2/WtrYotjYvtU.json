You keep using \nthe soap until it's at that phase where it's small and it will start to \nbreak apart. so you get some more soap.

As its second ionization is so weak, the \nfull urate salts tend to hydrolyze back to hydrogen urate salts and free \nbase at pH values around neutral. It is aromatic because of the purine \nfunctional group.\n\nAs a bicyclic, heterocyclic purine derivative, uric acid does not protonate \nat an oxygen [-OH] like carboxylic acids do. X-Ray diffraction studies on \nthe hydrogen urate ion in crystals of ammomium hydrogen urate, formed in \nvivo as gouty deposits, reveal the keto-oxygen in the 2 position of a \ntautomer of the purine structure exists as a hydroxyl group and the two \nflanking nitrogen atoms at the 1 and 3 positions share the ionic charge in \nthe six-membered pi-resonance-stabilized ring.[2]\n\nThus, while most organic acids are deprotonated by the ionization of a \npolar hydrogen-to-oxygen bond, usually accompanied by some form of \nresonance stabilization (resulting in a carboxylate ion), uric acid is \ndeprotonated at a nitrogen atom and uses a tautomeric keto/hydroxy group as \nan electron-withdrawing group to increase the pK1 value. The five-membered \nring also possesses a keto group (in the 8 position), flanked by two \nsecondary amino groups (in the 7 and 9 positions), and deprotonation of one \nof these at high pH could explain the pK2 and behavior as a diprotic acid. \nSimilar tautomeric rearrangement and pi-resonance stabilization would then \ngive the ion some degree of stability. (On the structure shown at the \nupper-right, the NH at the upper-right on the six-membered ring is \"1\", \ncounting clockwise around the six-membered ring to \"6\" for the keto carbon \nat the top of the six-membered ring. The uppermost NH on the five-membered \nring is \"7\", counting counter-clockwise around this ring to the lower NH, \nwhich is \"9\".)\n\nUric acid was first isolated from kidney stones in 1776 by Scheele.[3] As \nfar as laboratory synthesis is concerned, in 1882, Ivan Horbaczewski \nclaimed to have prepared uric acid by melting urea hydrogen peroxide with \nglycine, trichlorolactic acid, and its amide.[citation needed] Soon after, \nrepetition by Eduard Hoffmann shows that this preparation with glycine \ngives no trace of uric acid, but trichlorolacetamide produces some uric \nacid. Thus, Hoffmann was the first to synthesize uric acid.[4]\n\nSolubility[edit]\nIn general, the water solubility of uric acid and its alkali metal and \nalkaline earth salts is rather low. All these salts exhibit greater \nsolubility in hot water than cold, allowing for easy recrystallization. \nThis low solubility is significant for the etiology of gout. The solubility \nof the acid and its salts in ethanol is very low or negligible. In ethanol \nwater mixtures, the solubilities are somewhere between the end values for \npure ethanol and pure water.",
