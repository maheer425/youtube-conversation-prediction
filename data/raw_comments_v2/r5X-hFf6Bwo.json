Can somebody please \nenlighten me how the hobbit franchise being the one with the newer \ntechnology and bigger budget look worse than the previous franchise over 10 \nyears ago with a much smaller budget.\n\nJust combine any two (Or even one) of the LOTR films STILL being under 200 \nmillion and it will STILL be superior in almost everything than what the \nHobbit has to offer.\n Was P.J afraid that not many people will come to watch the film so he \ndecided to spend the majority of the budget on advertisements? Even though \nthere are millions of tolkien and lotr fanboys that would watch the film \nanyway? Even though the lotr is considered to be one of the few franchises \nthat reached the pinnacle of the most successful money making at the box \noffice of all time?   ",
