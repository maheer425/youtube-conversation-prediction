You have gnar turning red+the sound+ the rage \nmeter to help you avoid the beastly god of his transform and that \ncompletely sucks because as good as mini gnar is, hes very squishy with a \nsmall range that makes him easy to get caught. even if you use e to dodge, \ne has the longest cool down out of all his skills so when you go back to \nharass or farm the wave you either have to flash to dodge lockdown again or \nget caught.

Because he's ranged, he can easily poke melee champions \nout of reach. Also giving him an escape tool like hop just makes him even \nmore annoying to deal with, knowing that he basically has double flash. \nMega-gnar gives him more durability and abilities that allow you to dish \neven more damage on both close range and afar.\nTo top this shit off, he uses no mana, so he can cast any of his abilities \nfreely without cost, so he can keep poking and jumping away forever.\nOnly counter to Gnar is Irelia, meanwhile she's counter to the majority of \ntop champions.\n\nAsking a buff for him is just fucking ABSURD.",
