The colors of those \ncloths however, too colorful for our today.\n*0:22 We see flying cars, however we still rely on airplanes.\n*0:26 We see even flying police cars, none in our today unless you want to \ncount drones. Also cars in this today have a computer mouse-esque look to \nthem, none common place today.\n*0:36 In a general view of the city in this today, there are lots of people \nwithout the dependent need of a smartphone, hmmmm.\n*0:52 That red car is still too far \"futuristic looking\" in actual today \nstandards.\n*1:00 Don't get me started on this one, gas stations haven't changed since \nthis movie came out. But they still used gas and oil? I guess we got that \nright.\n*1:08 3D has improved far better, but still depending on special glasses, \nin this today it's true 4D with no glasses needed. This is outside and \ncinemas have trouble making 3D a mainstream and seamless thing.\n*1:22 Well, we sorta got that right with holograms performing at concerts, \nbut in this today, they have them outside.\n*1:30 haha Traffic is still a major issue.\n*1:38 Well, at least they still depict mailboxes, since we still use \nphysical mail in our lives.\n*1:42 Flying Cars, if they even are a thing of our today, wouldn't cost \nabout $40,000 in a debut, unless our currency got deflated all of the \nsudden.\nAlso the price is $39,999,9 *5*, in this today, we can assume they got rid \nof the penny, but yeah in our today.............\n*1:46 Okay, we got that right obviously, but the way the shop there \ndisplays it's stuff is off. I was suspecting glass cases over them or \nbehind counters.\nOverall, Our 2015 seems primitive and haven't changed since the 80s \ncompared to this 2015.\ufeff",
