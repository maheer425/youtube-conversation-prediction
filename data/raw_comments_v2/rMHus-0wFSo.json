In my nightmare, I would \nawaken still in a pitch black bedroom with only a glimmer of dull grey \nlight through my curtains (just above me on the wall to my immediate right, \nmy bed pushed up against it). I would be paralyzed and hear a quiet \nfootstep (I knew it was on the stairs), a long period of time would elapse \nand I'd hear a slightly louder footstep. Gradually, the footsteps would \nbecome louder and louder, and the time between them would become shorter \nand shorter until I felt a massively loud stampeding in my head and a huge, \nanthropomorphic silhouette would appear in my doorway and dash towards me \naiming it's outstretched fingers towards my throat. I'd wake up in a panic, \nand sometimes the nightmare would repeat. This nightmare disappeared for a \ndecade or so, yet when I lived on my own/with friends/with my girlfriend, I \nstarted to experience this terror again, however this time it was lucid \n(although me being in my family home in said apparition) and upon hearing \nthe first 'thud', I thought \"Fucking COME ON THEN!!!!\". I'd wait around in \nthe bed I slept in as a child until after seemingly a lifetime I'd hear \nthat second, louder thud. At this point I wanted to kill the silhouette \nthat haunted my childhood so I'd dash into the hallway. I'd be petrified at \nthis point, but insisted on turning the corner and running down the stairs \n- it was no longer just a black silhouette, but flashing white teeth. I'd \nrun full pelt towards my enemy determined to kill it, I remember imagining \nthat I'd punch, kick, bite, elbow and headbutt it, and I fucking did, but \nas soon as I felt in my dream that I was doing it damage, I'd wake up next \nto my girlfriend screaming like a psychopath! I've proof read this and it \nsounds like bollocks, but I promise you that this was my re-occurring \nnightmare. It still occasionally springs back to haunt me to this day, but \nwith the same result.  What the fuck is wrong with me? What does this mean?\ufeff",

I was doing random \nthings so I was just shooting fire at a wheel on a cart and it was \nspinning, so I said, \"Look, the wheel is spinning\" and at that exact moment \nis when I new that I've experienced this before, even if it was in a dream, \nI did. And I knew exactly what my father was going to say, I could have \ntaken the words out of his mouth, he said, \"The /burning/ wheel is \nspinning\" because apparently it was still on fire or something but anyways, \nI totally get what you mean, and I've had a few more that were places as \nwell, like dreaming of a gas station and seeing it built a couple months \nlater its pretty cool but pretty freaky.\nThis also isn't only psychology and our dreams and the way they work but \nthe science of space and time because time really isn't as linear and \nstrict as we think (it really is a big ball of wibbly wobbly timey wimey \nstuff) and in space time we can see an event at different times, and they \nhappen at different times so its totally plausible to see a certain event \nbefore it actually happens, and even though there are different theories of \ndeja vu, I believe it is correlated to that mostly, because everything in \nspace time is, was and always will be, even if it hasn't happened to us \nyet, it has still happened, everything we've done and will do already \nhappened at some point, past, present, and future as well.\nSorry for the big speel, I'm just happy to find someone who has the same \nthing happen to them ^-^",

            "text": "So I've had 1 or 2 deja vu moments in my life, but it's not like I see \nsomething and then go \"I feel like I've already seen that\". I recognized \nthe setting and context of a TV show that I didn't even know much about, \nand mentally predicted what was going to happen. I was 100% correct and it \nwent according to my memory. I have a rather high IQ and most of it is.. \nI'm not sure if \"allocated\" is the correct word.. maybe due to? Most of it \nis due to my exceptional memory. I was able to recall precise details about \nsomething that hadn't happened yet. My only explanation is that I \nsubconsciously noticed a trailer for that episode at some point in my life \nthat depicted exactly what I was able to predict. That is, assuming what I \nrecall is actually what happened. Since I dabble in psychology, I very well \nknow that it is possible that I actually had seen the episode before, but \nmy brain altered my memory so that this \"phenomenon\" occurred so that I \nwould think of myself as special, which is a slight indicator of \nnarcissism. But hey! Interesting tidbit conundrum to ponder. Any alternate \nexplanations are appreciated. I very much doubt that, even though my \ninference skill is greatly adept, that I was able to infer precisely what \nwas going to happen to the letter completely based on what I had seen \nbefore hand. I came to watching the episode mid-way, so I had very little \ncontext given in that moment, but I seemed to uncannily recall the context \nstill.\ufeff",

Should we allow companies to put workers on \nnight shifts 40+ hours a week. While you can say that you could sleep \nduring the day, we humans definitely aren't meant to. While I didn't notice \nit after i got used to working overnights after I stopped I definitely \nnoticed a huge positive boost in almost every aspect of my life.\n\nIn conclusion in my opinion we shouldn't allow employers to make employees \ntake night shifts(11am-7am).
