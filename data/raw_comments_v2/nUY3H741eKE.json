That summary \ncan be for either short film, but do you want to know the difference \nbetween the two? 'The Anti-Social Network' came out in July of 2013, but \n'Connected' came out in April of 2014. I'm not exactly saying it was \ncopied, because who am I to know, but there's a possibility that it was. \nFor all I know, it could just be the whole 'Hunger Games'/ 'Battle Royale' \nsituation.
