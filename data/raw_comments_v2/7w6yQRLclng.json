Our elected officials seem to either think that \nhealth care should only be had by the highest bidder, or worst, that it's \nnot worth really fighting for ( they could be putting there jobs in danger \n). And without a doubt, at least to me, is the wholesale abandonment of \nnews reporting. Our news media has been completely taken over ( bought and \npaid for ) by the same groups that put most of us in that \" surplus \npopulation \" category. Now they have their eyes on Youtube, and when that's \ntaken I see no place left for real \" News that you can use\".  Hank, sorry \nfor the bummer comment, but at least we have the Green brothers on our \nside.
