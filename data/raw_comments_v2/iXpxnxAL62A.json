It appears that \nyou get too much of your information from pop culture, and of the Twilight \nvariety at that.\n\nLet's just go over a few things. For starters, vampires die when in direct \nsunlight, are repelled and harmed by commonly found items (garlic, \ncrucifixes, holy water, etc.), are almost constantly tortured by an \nunquenchable thirst for blood, and are incapable of entering someone's home \nwithout their permission (similar to some stories about witches). \nFurthermore, vampires would logically be unable to get an erection, so that \nin itself is a pretty big negative.\n\nWerewolves, traditionally, were simply shapeshifters who could take the \nform of a wolf at will, although they often required a certain item to do \nso. They were also hindered by the fact that they'd be trapped in their \nhuman form if their clothes were stolen. I'd definitely choose werewolf \nover vampire.\n\nDuring medieval times, it was a common belief that vampires were werewolves \nwho hadn't been burned after death.\ufeff",

That's \nnot really relevant, though, seeing as vampires existed in myth far before \nBram Stoker's character based on Vlad III (Vlad the Impaler).\n\nOne may be illegal, but nothing is physically preventing you from doing so. \nYou're definitely not incapable of it. You're also not currently driven by \na lust for human blood, so not being able to enter someone's home unless \nyou're invited doesn't present nearly as large of an obstacle to you. I \nlove garlic, but you're entitled to your own opinion. It would really suck \nhaving a weakness commonly found in a jar of Prego, though. I don't really \nhave that last issue, but I'd definitely prefer it to never being able to \nhave sex again.\n\nGood to see that you detest Twilight.",

Not being able to enter \nsomeone's abode unless invited and being repulsed by garlic are two traits \nthat I already effectively have, because one's illegal and the other is \ndisgusting, so not much changes there. Not being able to get an erection is \ninfinitely better than always getting unwanted ones, so that's a positive \nrather than a negative for me.\n\nAlso, fuck Twilight. Eugh. ",
