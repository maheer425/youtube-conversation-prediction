The build up of H+ will build a \ngradient potential that will diffuse back through the thylakoid and into \nthe chloroplast! and in doing so powering other proteins that put together \nhigh energy molecules.

            "text": "Basically the video in text, hopefully to further your understanding.\n\nRequires water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and light.\nRoots of plants absorb water and transport it to the leaves through xylem, \nCO2 enters the plant (while O2 exits) through microscopic pores in leaves \ncalled stomata, and individual photons are absorbed from the sun in the \nplant by the pigment chlorophyll.\n**It is important that O2 levels remain low (explained later) for the \nCalvin Cycle (Stage 2)\nInside the cell of plants are plastids called chloroplasts, which contain \nthylakoids (which store chlorophyll), which contain lumen inside and Stroma \noutside; stacks of thylakoids are called grana.\n\n\nLight Dependent Reactions (Stage 1)\nPS II (wavelength p680)\n-Photons strike the chlorophyll in Photosystem 2 (PS II) and an electron \nabsorbs the energy and becomes excited (photoexcitation), but has nothing \nto do with this energy.\n-The electron travels from PS II (1st protein complex of 4) along the \nElectron Transport Chain (via mobile electron carriers) to harness the \nenergy; across a series of reactions the electrons lose their energy.\n-The energised electrons from PS II that were picked up by electron \ncarriers are transported to the 2nd protein complex, the Cytochrome Complex.\n-The cytochrome complex stands in between PS II and PS I (which are all \nembedded in the thylakoid membrane), and uses the lost energy from the \nelectrons to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid.-Now missing an \nelectron, the chlorophyll molecule will split a H20 molecule in cooperation \nwith PS II to steal its electron and replenish the one it lost, the \nby-products of this process are hydrogen ions (single protons) and oxygen.\n**By-product of oxygen is the reason behind the survival of living \norganisms.\n-Protons accumulated from the splitting of H2O and via the cytochrome \ncomplex now in the thylakoid then move towards the enzyme ATP Synthase, \nwhich uses that energy to pack an inorganic phosphate (Pi) onto ADP to \ncreate ATP.\n\nPS I (wavelength p700)\nThe 'tired' electrons becomes reenergised by some photons as it reaches \nPhotosystem 1 (PS I) and travels on another electron carrier, where all of \nthe energy is used to help make NADPH (similar to ATP) by an enzyme, which \ncombines 2 electrons and 1 Hydrogen ion with NADP+. (NADP+ + 2 e- + 1 H+ = \nNADPH).\n**Products of light dependent reactions: Chemical energy in the form of ATP \nand NADPH, as well as the by-product O2.\n\n\n\nLight Independent Reactions/Calvin Cycle (Stage 2)\n**Doesn't require light energy from photons, uses energy derived from ATP \nand NADPH to fuel processes\nCarbon Fixation (1st phase of Calvin Cycle)\n-Begins in the Stroma (empty space of chloroplast). Involves fixing a CO2 \nmolecule onto Ribulose-Biphosphate or RuBP (the starting and end point of \nthe 'cycle'), with the help of an enzyme called RuBisCo (which converts \ninorganic carbon into organic carbon), which causes it to become unstable.\n-So this new 6-Carbon chain has to break apart, creating 2 molecules of \n3-Phopshoglycerate, which occurs to 3 molecules of RuBP (explained later).\n**If RuBisCo reacts with O2 instead of CO2, it creates a toxic by-product \nknown as phosphogycolate (process of photorespiration) believed to alter \nenzymatic functions. \n\nReduction (2nd phase)\n-ATP combines a phosphate group onto the 3-Phosphoglycerate molecules and \nthen NADPH packs some electrons, creating 2 molecules of Glyceraldehyde \n3-Phosphate (G3P).\n-G3P is a high-energy, 3-carbon compound that plants can convert into many \ncarbohydrates such as glucose, or cellulose or starch.\n\nRegeneration (3rd and last phase)\n-9 ATP molecules and 6 NADPHs are required to convert the 3 RuBPs started \nwith into 6 G3Ps, however only 1 G3P can leave the cycle - with the other 5 \nG3Ps needed to regenerate the original 3 RuBPs, completing 1 round of the \ncycle.\n**G3P is considered the ultimate product of photosynthesis as the glucose \ngained from it is the energy used by all cells.\ufeff",

As a gardener, I know many plants \nhave struggles to survive. Small things affect the way plants thrive. For \nexample, I had a dumb cane plant and I move it over to the sun so it got a \nfew extra hours of light (like 3) and it started to die. Another example is \nwater. Some plants need a lot of water. Since RubBisCO is inefficient to \nyou, it requires a lot of resources such as water so these materials can be \nactually made. So since a lot of plants have issues with getting materials \nsuch as water, then they will start to die because they will use up all \navailable water to have energy to make more RuBisCO. And so according to \nevolution, plants with mutations/adaptations that cause the plants to \nthrive better should take over the other ones. Unfortunately, some things \nare broken here as in your quote \"If it's ain't broke, don't fix it.\" I \nhave many plants that drain resources like crazy and they aren't evolving \neven though they've existed for  long time.",

There's a reason why GMO corporations are trying to make \nplants that modify the RuBisCO. RuBisCO is rate-limiting for \nphotosynthesis. And since it's inefficient a lot of it has to be made which \nrequires energy which the plant might not have in extreme environments. And \ngoing this path helps disprove evolution. EDIT: Because plants would be \ndying because they are using all energy too fast.\n\nOtherwise: It is efficient because it does what the plant needs and doesn't \ninterfere with its functions. Also, since it is slower, it won't use up \nresources as quickly and so the plant will not be converting all possible \ncarbon dioxide to oxygen so the plant could still maintain homeostasis.
