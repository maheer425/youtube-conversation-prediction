You never saw it sold or advertised because they keep \nit away from tourist areas because they know it affects reputation. My \nmom's friend still eats dog because she is a singer and she says that dog \nmakes you feel really energized so she eats it before every concert she \ndoes in Korea. Nobody in my family likes to eat dog, I think it's kinda \ncruel, because the dogs are beaten to death before being eaten instead of \nbeing quickly and painlessly killed. I hate eating dog because everytime I \nsee it happen it reminds me of my dog, and many Korean people nowadays \ndon't like it as well because a lot of Korean people own dogs now too. \nAgain only like 5 percent of the population still eats dog, and they are \nmostly the older generation. Technically eating dog in Seoul is illegal \nbecause during the Olympic games in Seoul they didn't want to scare away \ntourists, but it isn't actually well enforced, it was only well enforced \nduring the Olympic games, so it's not very hard to find a gaegogi vendor \n(gae means dog, gogi means meat). Thankfully, my apartment in Korea is in a \nneighbourhood with many pet owners and a pet store, so there aren't any \ngaegogi places close to it. ",

I don't like the fact that they eat dogs, but I \nadmit that it is something that used to be done but isn't as popular now. I \ndoubt you know more than me, I can speak Korean and I was born in South \nKorea, I visit it every year, so how about you stop assuming you know shit \nabout everything, since when did you know my entire life story? I never \nonce suggested that I know everything but I hate people who act like they \nknow everything when they don't. If you don't know the answer for sure, \ndon't act like your an expert and mislead us with false information. I've \nnever eaten dog before, but my dad has, and my mom has eaten by accident \nbefore as well. My mom was once tricked into thinking it was beef but she \nfound out later after the meal it was dog, but this was when she was really \nreally young and stupid (she told me she was like 3 or 5 years old at the \ntime).
