Great written movies are like that, they make for \ngood conversation many years after. In real life though I think if the '55 \nhooks up, Falfa makes toast out of the Deuce. I was a Junior in High School \nin 1973 when this film was first shown and went to see it in a  black '57 \nChevy. Fun days they were!!\ufeff",

'63 was a different story but the movie was set in '62. \n\nA 409-cubic-inch (6.7 L) version was Chevrolet's top regular production \nengine from 1961 to 1965, with a choice of single or dual four-barrel \ncarburetors. Bore and stroke were both up from the 348 to 4.312 in (109.5 \nmm) by 3.50 in (88.9 mm). On December 17, 1960, the 409 engine was \nannounced along with the Impala SS (Super Sport) model. The initial version \nof the engine produced 360 hp (268 kW), with a single four-barrel Carter \nAFB carburetor. The same engine was upped to 380 hp (283 kW) in 1962. A 409 \nhp (305 kW) version of this engine was also available, developing 1 hp per \ncubic inch with a dual four-barrel aluminum intake manifold and two Carter \nAFB carburetors. It had a forged steel crankshaft.[1]\n\nIn the 1963 model year, output reached 425 hp (317 kW) at 6200 rpm with the \n2X4 setup, 11.25:1 compression and a solid lifter camshaft. This engine was \nimmortalized in the Beach Boys song titled \"409\". The engine was available \nthrough mid-1965, when it was replaced by the 396-cubic-inch 425 hp (317 \nkW) Mark IV big-block engine. In addition, a 340 hp (254 kW) version of the \n409 engine was available from 1963\u20131965, with a single four-barrel \ncast-iron intake mounting a Rochester 4GC square-bore carburetor, and a \nhydraulic-lifter camshaft.\n\nObviously the premise was that Milner's engine was a highly modified small \nblock in its '62 setting. Bear in mind that at that time there were 292 ci \nsmall blocks revving to the stars propelling '55 Chevy 210 Sedans at the \nstrip at the time to amazing ET numbers for their day... ",
