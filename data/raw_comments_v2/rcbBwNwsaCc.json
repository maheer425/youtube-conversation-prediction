They are just dressing up \nas them because they think its cool to pretend. Being white, people think \nits fine to crack jokes about \"whities\" all the time, because we aren't \nseen as a \"race\" to allot of people. But I don't mind. I find it funny too \nsometimes. Just type \"white people meme\" to see what I am talking about. \nLighten up, they're just dress-ups.\n\n I think apart of the problem with racism, is that there is allot of pent \nup anger for what happened in the past. So when someone dresses up as \nsomeone, even if they are just trying to show their fascination with that \nculture, people take it the wrong way and label it \"racist\". We need to be \ncareful when we use that word. Its used so often, that if anyone even \nmentions another culture or says anything they don't like about someone who \nhappens to be another race, people say its racist.\n\nRacism is not when you do something or say anything about something or \nsomeone involving another culture. Its only racist when you make a \njudgment, bad or good, about a group of people, based  ONLY on their \ngenetic heritage. So if I said a person was stupid because they were black, \nthat would be racist. But if I said a person was stupid because they put a \nbanana up their nose, and they happened to be black, that is NOT racist, \nbecause I said they were stupid because of WHAT THEY DID, not just because \nthey were black. People really misuse this word allot.\n\n\nIn this example, people dressing up as native New Zealanders is not racist. \nIf they were dressing up as New Zealander's and shouting \"All New \nZealander's are retarded!\" and were making fun of them just for being a New \nZealander, that would be racist.\n \nBasically, if you make a claim or decision regarding another culture, based \nsolely on the way they were born, on their culturally identifyable genetic \nmakeup, that is racist. But just interacting with another culture is not \nracist.",
