But they are very glanced over.\n\nIn 1520, Denmark's king Christian II had just conquered Sweden after a war. \nThe Swedish king had just been injured and Christian II promised that if \nSweden would surrender, he would grant an amnesty to anyone involved. \nSweden accepted, and o celebrate his victory, he held a huge feast and \nparty in Stockholm with all the nobles which lasted for 3 days. But on the \nlast day, the gates were closed all of a sudden. A court was initiated and \nmany nobles sentenced to death, and around 80-90 nobles and priest were \nkilled in the Old Town, today known as the 'Stockholm Bloodbath'.\n\nOne who had not trusted Christian II's promise was Gustav Vasa. His father \nwas killed in the Bloodbath, and Gustav Vasa fled to the Swedish province \nof Dalarna (also called the Dales) and told the peasants to rise and fight \nChristian II. At first they refused, and Gustav Vasa set off for Norway, \nbut then they changed their mind and two men followed Gustav Vasa trails to \ntell him to come back. This event is today celebrated with the annual Vasa \nRace (Vasaloppet).\n\nTo fight the Danes, Gustav Vasa asked the german company Hansan for german \ntroops to help in the war. In exchange, he would give them trade rights. By \n1521, Christian II, now known as Christian the Tyrant, was no longer king \nover Sweden. Gustav Vasa had won. But he was left with a huge debt to \nHansan. He was then visited by a priest named Olaus Petri who told him \nabout Martin Luther and his ideas, and Gustav Vasa saw an opportunity. If \nhe would make Sweden switch from Catholicism to Protestantism, he would be \nappointed head of the church, and would get access to all of the church's \nriches. In addition to this, he ordered every church to give up their huge \nriches of silver and their biggest bells. This angered the peasants, and \nthey regretted that they had ever helped him become king. Rebellions broke \nout several times, but no one led to anything.\n\nThe memory of Gustav Vasa is greatly honored. There is a Finnish city named \nafter him (Vaasa), the ski event Vasaloppet, one of Sweden's biggest \nattractions, the Vasa Ship, is named after him.\ufeff",

The Bishop of Rome as he was known, \nwanted power and argued that Christian Church should take a more active \nrole in ruling the people (read kingdoms). The other 4 bishops, led by the \nBishop of Byzantium said no. Big argument ensued, going back and fort for a \nnumber of years, culminating in the Great Schism of  1054.\n\nEastern roman empire including : Byzantium, Greece, Pontus (what is now \nTurkey) and later Russia, remained Orthodox Christian, siding with the \nbishops of Constantinople while remnants of western roman empire including: \nFrance, Spain, British isles, Germany, Austria and Italian states went \nahead with the pope and catholic church. The reason why Catholic Church had \nmore followers is because the western Europe was more populated than \neastern end.\n\nAnyway by 1517 when Luther nailed his thesis, the church was already split \nfor 400 years and the two christian religons couldn't be more different \nfrom one another.\n\nWhile catholics dwell in politics, money, power games and STAKE BURNING, \nthe orthodox took a more restrained, conservative approach: anything that \nwas not in line with christian creed of Nicea, was deemed not christian, \nhowever they didn't burn anyone at the stake for it. The attitude was: we \ndeal with souls of men, the secular powers deal with the rest.\n\nThat's one of the reasons for example, in Romania, we never had a problem \nseparating the Church and State, they were separated from the beginning.\ufeff",

            "text": "+Karl Karlos \n Why do we have to make fun of? Exactly where does that get us?\n\nAlright, so from your comment before I do assume you believe in the \nhistorical Jesus. At least that, seeing that 99% of serious historians and \nscholars would not deny this. It is historical fact that a Jewish Rabbi \nnamed Jesus of Nazareth lived. It does not matter what you believe about \nhim. I assume you're going to say the apostles made the whole resurrection \nbecause they were too loyal to their dead leader. Hm... yeah history does \nnot agree. As Lane Craig writes, \u201cIf your favorite Messiah got himself \ncrucified, then you either went home or else you got yourself a new \nMessiah.\" No one, would claim a resurrection. Not the Greeks since the \nresurrection of the dead was foolish to them. To the Greeks, you went to \nHades when you died. Some Greek philosophers of that day even said that \nbeing resurrected would be as horrible as hell because they viewed the body \nas a prison. Views like these among the Greek is why it was hard for Paul \nto convert them at Athens, because Athens was kind of like the center of \nGreek philosophy at the time. Alexandria was too. Jews would also have a \nvery hard time believing that Jesus of Nazareth rose. Some Jews did believe \nin the resurrection of the dead, but not all. And only those who believed \nin it believed it would happen at the end of time when the Messiah comes. \nNot that the Messiah himself would be resurrected before everyone else. \nThat would have seemed crazy. Basically, no rational person of the time \nwould go as far as to claim someone resurrected, let alone if that person \nclaimed to be the Messiah. Yet this early Jewish sect, becoming \nChristianity a few decades later, claimed this.\n\nThe very fact that the empty tomb story appears in all four gospels, as \nwell as the accounts of Paul, tells scholars and historians it was an \nextremely early tradition that simply couldn't be changed. Not only this, \nbut the account says women found the tomb empty. In that time, women were \nnot considered reliable sources for events. No one would make up a story \nthat had women as the first eye witnesses. Yet, the story's of the empty \ntomb says that women were the very first eyewitnesses. A survey taken says \nthat 75% of New Testament scholars, regardless of their beliefs, agree that \nthe empty tomb is a historical event. You could claim they went to the \nwrong tomb, or the disciples stole it. Well, the disciples stealing it I \nkind of already addressed in my first paragraph above. But to add more to \nit, the Romans and Jews could have easily gone up to the tomb and looked \nfor themselves. They could have taken Jesus's body and dragged it through \nthe streets to show he was still dead. But even the Jews had their own \nexplanation for the empty tomb. This is shown in Matthew 28. Also, there \nwere guards at the tomb. No way cowardly disciples would attempt to steal \nthe body. But, how do we know that they didn't go to the wrong tomb?\n\nWell, most scholars do believe that the resurrection appearances lie in \nvery early traditions. The account Paul gives in 1 Corinthians 15, many \nscholars believe Paul was actually reciting an early Creed from the \napostles themselves. Scholars date it from within only a few months after \nthe initial events, to about 5 years after the initial events. Also, Paul \nsays from an early tradition that doesn't even appear in the gospels \nthemselves that over 500 people witnessed the resurrected Christ in 1 \nCorinthians 15. James the Just, the cousin of the Jesus, was one. James the \nJust didn't believe in Jesus at first, thinking he was crazy. But when \nJesus appeared to him after the resurrection., that is when James converted.\n\nAlso, no way the disciples would die for a lie. Most of the disciples of \nJesus, who had claimed to see him after he rose, went to many lengths to \nspread what they had witnessed. they died for it! Now, you could die for a \nlie you think is true. But most people would not die for a lie they knew \nwas false. But they all were killed for their belief and profession of \nfaith in the resurrected Messiah! Scholars and historians agree that all of \nthem were completely sure in their faith that Christ had rose. Even Paul \nsays in 1 Corinthians 15:14, \"If Christ has not been raised, then our \npreaching is useless, and your faith is in vain.\" \n\nHistory is on Christianity side. \"I do not regard deliberate fraud as a \nworthwhile explanation. Many of the people in these lists were to spend the \nrest of their lives proclaiming that they had seen the risen Lord, and \nseveral of them would die for their cause. Moreover, a calculated deception \nshould have produced great unanimity. Instead, there seem to have been \ncompetitors: \u2018I saw him first!\u2019 \u2018No! I did.\u2019 Paul\u2019s tradition that 500 \npeople saw Jesus at the same time has led some people to suggest that \nJesus\u2019 followers suffered mass hysteria. But mass hysteria does not explain \nthe other traditions.\" - E.P Sanders",
