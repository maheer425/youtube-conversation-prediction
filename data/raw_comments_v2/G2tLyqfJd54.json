            "text": "Sooo This whole argument in the comments is stupid. I've been called racist \nbecause i thought one person who was mocking two cops who got shot was a \nhorrible person. to me laughing, and mocking someone who is hurt and cannot \ndefend them selves is despicable, petty, and just plane horrible. was the \nwoman black? yes, have i ever once in my life cared about someones skin \ncolor? no, one of my dads closest friends who helped raze me was black, one \nof my very best most trusted friends is black. so being called racist for \nnot agreeing with someone because they are a different skin color makes no \nsense to me.  Now for everyone here let me Quote from the Dictionary what \nracism means \"the belief that all members of each race possess \ncharacteristics or abilities specific to that race, especially so as to \ndistinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.\"\n\nNow the definition being said, Disagreeing with someone who has a different \ncolor of skin is not Racist, Going out of your way to harm, put down, or \ndiminish a person or persons life, because they are a different color skin \nthen you are IS RACIST. I did this because maybe people who use the word \nwill learn what it means and use it in a better manner, instead of throwing \nit down like a Win all argument.\n\nNow a word that Keeps getting thrown around is Ignorant. as above here is \nthe Definition of Ignorant \"lacking knowledge or awareness in general; \nuneducated or unsophisticated.\"  So again disagreeing with who is on the \nopposite side is not Ignorant. if they are able to put of facts and Actual \ntalking points to back there argument up then they are not ignorant, If \nthey are only calling names and trying to bully people into shutting up, \nThose people are Ignorant because they do not show any signs of \nintelligence besides calling names.\n\nOk, My views on Both political parties.  It's simple, Both sides are \nMAJORLY FLAWED.\nPeople say that all republicans Hate gay marrage, thats simply not true, \nNot ALL republicans hate gay marrage. Allot do, that is true, but allot \nreally just dont give a crap what two people do in there own home, they \njust dont want it in there face.\n\nNOW, in your face to me is when people go out of their way to do something \nthat they know will piss someone off. Just being seen holding hands or a \nlight kiss is not IN YOUR FACE. same with religious people (yes i have to \nbring this up, its on my mind, sorry) just cus someone says grace before \neating their food is not in your face, being religious is not in your face, \ngoing to school and being religious is not in your GOD DAMN FACE! gah. \nFucking bring the bible to school, who cares its your book, bring the \nQuran, why does anyone care? how i see it is they see any sign of religion, \nits that religious person trying to stuff there religion down there \nthroats, when their not! stuffing religion down your throat is when You go \nup to someone, tell them they are immoral, tellt hem they need Jesus or \nAllah or they are going to hell. that is shoving it down your throat. Now \nTo all ATHEISTS who go out of there way to tell religious people they are \nstupid, wrong, insane, and what ever else you can think of, YOU ARE BEING A \nHYPOCRITE, YOU are shoving ATHEISM DOWN PEOPLES THROATS, and your being a \ndick.  also fyi im not even religious, i just believe everyone should have \nthe freedom to believe what ever the hell they want.\n\nbut back to the main point, personally I couldn't care less if a person was \ngay or not, i just do not want anyone to Go full PDA in my face, no matter \nthere straight or gay, it weirds me out.\n\nAbortion, I am not for it. My reason, My mother had an abortion 2 years \nbefore i was born and she threatened to abort me. Now before i knew that \ninformation about my past I did not care if people got an abortion, it was \n\"well it doesn't affect me so why should i care?\" and after knowing that \ninformation all i know now is I do not have a sibling i could have had, and \ni almost was not given the right to live. Personally I like living. so My \npersonal opinion is should people get an abortion? No. will i tell people \nthey are horrible people for getting one? No. I think if you want an \nabortion, at least Really think before you act, because you could be \ndepriving the world of the next Martin Luther King Jr. Or the next Einstein.\n\nWeed, In excess it can be bad, but in moderation who gives a crap. Should \nyou be allowed to drive stoned? I don't think that is a good idea, so i \nwould say no. should it be legal? has it killed anyone yet? No. what has \nweed done? brought in money to the government, and given a hell of allot of \npeople the munchies. so do i think it should be legal, If alcohol is legal \ni think weed should be too.\n\nTaxation/minimum wage, Personally id like it if less taxes were taken out \nof my paycheck. but here is what i know and i could be wrong. but when you \nprint more money then what the item that is backing the money is worth, \nthen what each individual piece of money is worth, is now worth less then \nbefore. If im not mistaken its called Inflation(again i could be wrong on \nthat.)  so with that information in mind if it is correct, then i believe \nthat the government shouldn't raze the minimum wage, i think that the \ngovernment should stop  printing money, stop spending on allot of really \nuseless stuff like those stupid light intersection speed traps. and focus \non Rebuilding what once was great about this country. how they should do \nthat? I honestly do not know, but i think they should come up with some \nway. \n\nI do not like Obama's politics, i do not like Bush's. there are allot of \nthings i wish Obama Had done better. that is my view on our president. \n\nNow you're probably wondering why i wrote all this, well its simple. I want \nto honestly know more, I want to get out all the things that i think are \nright and maybe correct them if they are wrong, and to vent because if i \nvented like this to all of my friends then hell i wouldn't have friends. do \ni think the republicans are worse then the democrats?  i honestly dont. but \ni do think that both sides have allot of things i do not agree with, \nRepublicans and Gay Marriage, Democrats and Abortion. There is plenty more \nbut that's kinda the sum of it.  also sorry for the grammar, if grammar is \nyour argument and or what ever then, you really suck at Civil arguments \nbecause that is what you pick to argue about, when iv named a few good \ntalking point up head.\n\nIf you want to comment, go ahead, Just try to keep it Civil :) \ufeff",
