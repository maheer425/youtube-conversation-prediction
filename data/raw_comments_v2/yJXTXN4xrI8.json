Most \npeople aren't aware that kidney damage is progressive and irreversible. So \nis dementia/alzheimers.  The only way plaque can get to the brain is by \nkidney filtered blood.  But the kidneys have many functions, one of which \nis to regulate electrolytes. Calcium is one of those electrolytes.  Calcium \nalso serves as a contributor to plaque. The kidneys have been described as \nthe \"pharmacy\" of the body.  Once damaged, the damage is progressive.  \nThere are over a million filtering nephrons in a kidney, but over time, \nthey die due to progressive nature of kidney damage/disease.  In my \nopinion, this is why Alzheimers usually occurs in old age.  The kidney is \ndead, or close to it.  It's filtering ability has diminished profoundly, \nand things like calcium are allowed past the filters. This calcium (plaque) \naccumulates on nerve endings and brain cells, hardening, and causing death.\n     There is no known cure or cause of Alzheimers, so why are there \nAlzheimer drugs?. Pain relievers, opioids, NSAIDs all are known to cause \nkidney damage.  There can be no drug cure for Alzheimers without damaging \nthe kidney.  I have no idea why the National Institute of Health doesn't \nfocus their attention on the kidneys?  By finding out the kidney GFR value \nof Alzheimer patients would go along way in identifying the problem. Kidney \nfailure has already been determined in about 50% of dementia cases. That \nshould be a good starting point. Kidney failure mimicks the same conditions \noutlined for Alzheimers.\ufeff",
