Clearly humans are meant to eat meat and eating \nmeat probably led us to be the technologically advanced species we are \ntoday. Also, humans have two eyeballs facing forward which means that we \nare predators and ate meat for millions of years.\n\n\nHow gender inequality is a result of biology and evolution from our hunter \ngatherer past.\n\nFor instance, males have more testosterone than females which leads males \nin general to be more assertive, aggressive, and risk taking.
