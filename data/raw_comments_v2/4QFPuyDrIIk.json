Batman only wears \nit when absolute necessary. It's Kryptonian tech armour suit to battle \naliens as such. I really don't understand why some people keep saying that \nStar Wars trailer is better, though, it was good as well. I like both \nmovies and we all know that the Star Wars prequel were dire and atrocious. \nBoth movies will rock the world on its own merits, totally different type \nof movies and people should stop comparing two iconic movies and trying to \nfind flaws in it. We need to cease reasons to dislike a section of the \ntrailer or Batman's suit isn't right or it looks like Iron Man, etc, these \nare thoughts we begin in our minds, trying to find a reason to complain. \n\"They say it begins with a fever, the rage and the feeling of powerlessness \nthat turns good men cruel.\" We are cruel if you hate something that you \ndon't comprehend fully and why it's occurring in the movie? Mere \nconjectures of how bad trailer looks is purely a figment of our imagination \nand doesn't warrant reasons to hate it. The trailer was beautiful, and \ndialogue in the trailer was smart and cool. If I love one movie trailer \ndoes it mean I dislike the other, no, I like a movie because, I'm pragmatic \nand judge it objectively and not malign it before it hits our theaters next \nyear. I have no doubt whatsoever about the outcome of this movie and Star \nWars, both titan movies have been made with precision, because, these type \nof movie deserves time to be created into a masterpiece, which I believe so \nit has.\ufeff",
