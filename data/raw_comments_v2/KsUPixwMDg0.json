            "text": "Ordered one myself a couple of months back, delivery late September \nhopefully. The car is a much better drive than some reviews / folks would \nhave you believe. If you can get past the thing that it's not the Uber hard \ncore hot hatch that the previous generation/s Clio were, then most people I \nsuspect would be pleasantly surprised how capable this car is both on the \nroad and track. As usual, it's pretty much a matter of what someone wants. \nAll of the current batch of hot hatches are decent motors (Fiesta ST, 208 \nGTI and the Clio RS). Just comes down to what you are looking for in a car. \nAs an example... the current generation Fiesta ST is a great little car and \nprobably the sharpest of the bunch. But the down side is the pretty firm \nride and the fact that it's pretty noisy at motorway speeds (not sure why, \nas Ford are usually good at sorting NVH). Now this might not bother some, \nor even be noticed much... but for me on our badly made up rural SW \nScottish roads, it pretty much ruled it out for me.While both the 208 GTI \nand the Clio have a much more forgiving ride. And the 4-doors of the Clio \nswung it for me. Plus once you take the time to get used to the EDC box \n(and it does take a while) I decided after many , many years of being a \nstick-shift man, that I rather liked it. Not perfect though... ideally it \nneeds a 7-speed box (some odd gear ratio's in the current box), and the \nfaster changes available in Race mode, should also be available in Sport \nmode. And \"yes\", the paddles on the steering wheel, rather than fixed on \nthe binnacle would be the icing on the cake. Though none of these issues \nstopped me from enjoying driving the car.\n\nAs usual, the only way to decide if it's the car for you, is to go for a \ndecent test drive (try and get it for at least an afternoon if possible). \nThen make your own mind up.\n\nI personally think this is one of the better and more objective reviews of \nthis car.\ufeff",

            "text": "+jflmd 916 edj\nHi... got fed up of waiting for a new car order (5 months and still a \nno-show) so cancelled my order and 2 days later bought an X Renault \nmanagement car (IE. not an X demo... so only one owner). Saved almost \u00a34.5k \nand a grand more for my trade in. So pretty much wiped out the first years \ndepreciation. Better buy in the end.\n\nIt's the lux model in Liquid yellow. Unluckily only on stock suspension, \nreally wanted the cup suspension. But to be totally honest, I think I \nprefer the silver wheels anyway.\n\nI've put another 8k miles on it since I bought it last October. And besides \nsome rusty wheels bolts (replaced under warranty), it's been faultless.\n\nRide and handling are spot on I think for the UKs poorly made up roads. \nMost of my driving (99%) is done on rural SW Scottish back roads. I think \nthe chassis balance is pretty damn good. Cabin quality fine, though some \nplastics are a bit hard and cheap looking (the car is not alone here I \nthink). Brakes for fast road use are very powerful, though for track use I \nthink you would want harder spec pads. Engine pulls well and is pretty \nlinear in it's power delivery. Though I wish it was a bit more vocal (both \nengine and exhaust).\n\nAs to the EDC auto box. I've not had any problems with it and not too sure \nwhy there is so many -ve comments about it. It's not the best DSG out \nthere, but it's more than reasonable. Normal auto mode works fine and is OK \nfor the odd time I go into town. The rest of the time I drive it manually \nwith the paddles. I find the speed of the changes acceptable (sport or race \nmode). I reckon you can change gear three times in the time it would take \nthe average driver (that's me then) to change manually once. Anyone that \nsays different, has either never driven the car, or has a faultily gearbox. \nOne thing you can do with the paddles, is pull one to quickly (but not hard \nenough) and hence not trigger the switch. I believe the switches on the \npaddles have been improved on the new Trophy edition that was shown at the \nGeneva motor show. Not a bad first effort for Getrag (gearbox manufacturer) \nand Renault in my opinion. Needs a bit more development work to sharpen it \nup a bit, but that's cars for you. But I can totally understand why some \njust prefer a manual box.\n\nAs a fast road car, I think it's a decent motor myself. And yes, I have \ndriven bot the Fiesta st and 208 gti, before deciding on the RS Clio. The \nClio is not quite as sharp a car to drive as previous gen ones, but in some \nways I consider it a better car for that (IE. far easier to live with).\n\nThough in the end it comes down to personal taste and what car in the end \nfloats your boat. Now if the Fiesta ST had come with the option of 4-doors \n(like it does in the USA) then I might have been willing to over look the \nharsh low speed ride and the couple of other things I did not like about \nthe car (NB. does not make it a bad car, just not for me). In the end, I'm \nhappy with the car I bought.\n\nJust to put things in perspective, I've had three Scoobies in the past, \nthen bought a new shape Suzuki Swift sport (downsized), then decided to \nsell both the Suzuki and the sensible family Fabia (our other car) and buy \njust the one motor (IE. the RS Clio).\n\nI shall be very interested to see what the revised car coming in September \n/ October will be like. I'm assuming here that some of the mods from the \nTrophy edition will be carried over to the stock car (just don't expect a \nmanual box). TBC\n\nPS. And if you are the sort of person that likes to get your car chipped. \nThen there are several reputable tuners out there that can extract another \n30/40 BHP with a simple re-map (cost around \u00a3400) to optimise for running \non super unleaded. Just watch the torque increase with it being and auto \nbox (they can account for this in the re-map).",
