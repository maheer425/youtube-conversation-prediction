            "text": "I wonder where the stories about 'sacrificing virgins' came from in the \nfirst place?  In cultures before the Industrial Revolution, the concept of \nvirgin the way we understand it didn't really exist.  'Virgin' was used to \neither refer to any young woman - saying nothing about their sexual \nexperience - or referred to a woman who had not yet given birth.  The idea \nthat there would be someone who has never had sex would have been very \nbizarre to pre-Industrial people.  Sex was pretty much ever-present in \npre-Industrial cultures.  Families didn't even have separate bedrooms, they \nall slept - and screwed - in common rooms.  People grew up witnessing sex \nfrom before they could remember.  They simply didn't know a world in which \npeople didn't have sex on a regular basis.  And since they couldn't get \npregnant or get someone else pregnant, their sex play was seen as \nharmless.  Sex was as normal as eating or sleeping.  It was just something \nfun to do that felt good.  The idea that someone would grow up and never \nexperience it was such a bizarre idea that the only time it was even \nsuggested was in stories about their version of superheroes - saints.\ufeff",

            "text": "Thank you for clearing this out, im from Mexico and currently working on \nsome motion graphics on the proper reading of the Aztec calendar also \ncalled \"Tonalpohualli\" I wasn't really aware of this but most of the \nforeign people at some point for some reason took this calendar as the main \nsymbol for the Mayan culture and wrap it around all this controversial \nprophecies bout the end of the world, and it has being really annoying \nreading all this papers about people misunderstanding the whole function or \nus being stupid for believing such prophecies, so here are some interesting \nand actual facts about the Aztec calendar that I've recently learned in a \nsurprising unexpected investigation : the calendar was actually trying to \ncompute 2 different cycles within its structure, the humans cycle or \n\"destiny\" which was represented by (260 days*divided in 20 blocks of 13 \ndays) and the earths cycle (365 days*divided in 18 blocks of of 20 days)+5 \ndays in order to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical \nor seasonal year. because seasons and astronomical events do not repeat in \na whole number of days and by inserting an additional day or month into the \nyear, the drift can be corrected. this deficit has being solved in \ncalendars by others civilizations in different ways for example in the \nGregorian calendar, the current standard calendar in most of the world, in \neach leap year, February has 29 days instead of 28, Adding an extra day to \nthe calendar every four years compensates for the fact that a period of 365 \ndays is shorter than a solar year by almost 6 hours ( this calendar was \nfirst used in 1582 ) this means it phases out 1 day every 3,200 years, the \nMuslim calendar phases out 1 day every 2,500 years, while the Jew and Egypt \ncalendar only had exactitude of 1 day every 300 hundred years. because of \nthe Aztec calendar added 5 extra days and started the year 4 days earlier \nevery 520 years plus dividing the whole astronomical spectrum in fractions, \nit takes 9,000 years for this calendar to phase out 1 day, with an annual \ndeficit of 11 min, which makes it the most precise and accurate calendar \nnowadays along with the Mayan ( which is a different calendar ) based on \nthe same principles that were established by the ancient Toltecas, Mexicas, \nNahuas or Aztecas. whats remarkable its that according to records this two \ncivilizations never met in its contemporary splendor, they also divided \ntheir calendar in 4 orientations and 5 \"Suns\" which are attached to the \nexact cycle of equinoxes and this is why there is no place for a sixth \n\"Sun\" in the calendar, it also takes the Sun, Earth and Venus  8 years to \nalign 5 times in the celestial sky (13 Venus orbits/ 8 Earth's orbits) the \nAztecs and Mayas had the \"Tzoltzin\" to compute 260 days/7200 times to \ncontain 360 days/5200 times to get the equivalent of 5 cycles (early/late \nmorning,evening, early/late night) of 5,125 tropic years each =25,625 years \n( the amount of time it takes the galaxy to complete a spin or cycle around \nthe sun called \"Galactic day\") The age of our solar system is about 20 of \nthese revolutions. the mathematically result geometry of all this \nrepresentations is the golden spiral and pentagram which is also formed by \nthe beginning points at the 20 blocks of  the 13 days countdown, this is \nexplained repeatedly within the calendar in 4 absolute languages: symbolic, \nnumeric, chromatic and geometric, each day contains the influence of the \ncorresponding past cycles and also points the variables on the equation \nwhich is called Trenza del tiempo or \"Time braid '', so in my opinion maybe \nthis calendars were only trying to quantify the beginning and end of \ngalactic days or cycles in relation with earth's orientation and \nastronomical proximity to the sun.\ufeff",
