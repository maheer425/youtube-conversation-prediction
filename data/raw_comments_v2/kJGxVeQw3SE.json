            "text": "Timcp1, aren't you the guy who deletes people's replies when they don't \nsuit your purpose?\n\ntimcp1: *\"How is it that European Atheists in the USA, believe the land was \nstolen from Native Americans, yet they live on stolen property? I've heard \n\"because I was born here\", as an answer. And that is suppose to justify \nliving on stolen property? That is the moral code of Atheism? If you were \nborn in a house that you found out was stolen a long time ago, you would \nbrush it off by saying \"I was born in this house\" Is that the Atheists code \nto receiving stolen goods? C'mon people. You say Christians are \ninconsistent. Penn should move back to wherever his ancestors trace to, \nsomewhere in Europe.\"*\n\nThe land did not belong to Native Americans - they were simply the first to \narrive when their ancestors trekked from Africa via Eastern Europe/Western \nAsia, Siberia and Alaska.  The atheists who say it was stolen are wrong and \nit is also wrong to say that the Native Americans are an 'indigenous \npopulation' - they are just the earliest colonizers.\n\nThe Native Americans had several thousand years to develop a system for \nallocating land  - as you say yourself, they adopted the system of *'let's \nfight for it'.* Some tribes practically practiced genocide by wiping out \ncertain other tribes.\n\nJust because the Europeans came late to the party didn't mean they had to \nmiss out on the fun, they joined in and played by the same rules that the \nNative Americans had laid down, that is, *'let's fight for it.'*  The \nNative Americans lost the fight to a superior force (but one no more \nmurderous or ruthless) as many tribes did to other tribes.  The losers were \ngenerously granted concessions to remain on the continent on lands they \ncould call their own - or allowed to join in to the 'new order' which \nbrought 'proper' land-management rules and policies.\n\nIt would be more useful to think of the Americas as a bus or streetcar - \nthe first on board gets their choice of seat but does not get to exclude \nanyone else or say where they sit.\n\ntimcp1: *\"+William Lame Craig I delete those comments whose authors call me \nnames and change the subject.  You say \"the atheists who claim it was \nstolen are wrong\", but my question points to a contradiction within their \nmoral belief that gives the benefit of the doubt as if they are right. In \nfact, that to me, is even better. Because when I can point to their immoral \nthought within a scenario they claim is right, then they can't handle when \na Christian shows that they themselves live in contradiction. They turn \nsmug and mean, change the subject, and most (80%) I have to delete anyway. \nThe others I leave behind when they stay on topic. Every one of those \nAtheists, always give the \"but Christians do it\" response, well, they \nbelieve Christians are evil and they are moral, so why then even ask about \nChristians. Then, when you tell them you don't believe the land is stolen, \nthey just say you are crazy for not believing it is stolen. Now, they're so \nfar off topic, the only thing they keep saying is I'm a moron etc. They \ndon't talk about morality, they don't talk about logic, and how that \njustifies them living on property they believe to be stolen because there \nis no logic behind them. Every Greek, from Socrates to Aristotle, would \nagree it is immoral to live on land you know to be stolen no matter how \nlong ago. Then, they claim all land was stolen and we trace to Africa. \nWell, when people fist left Africa, the land was up for grabs, so no, all \nthe land was not stolen. Lastly, the French have France, and the Natives \nget a tiny place within the USA. So, you know what? These people are \nimmoral and cant' handle the truth once convicted of it. Hence a delete for \nthose individuals, because they don't stick to the subject.\"*\n\nThe French have France?  Only because a whole load of nations helped them \nkeep it 70 years ago.  Like it or not, land is 'owned' by the strongest - \njust take any border dispute currently unsettled - there are plenty of them.\n\nThe Native Americans understood the rules and by the rules, they lost \ncustody of the land. Tough.\n\nI am part of a gang - and I pay my dues.  If anybody tries to occupy my \nland, my buddies will sort them out.\n\ntimcp1: *\"+William Lame Craig All that is grande, but for anyone to believe \nthe land is stolen and continues to live on stolen land while claiming they \nare morally superior, are immoral, a living contradiction. The intellectual \ncommunity who believes they can live on stolen land and still be moral, are \nfaced with an oxymoron they cannot handle. You being in a gang, in the \nU.S.A. I assume? As for you, you should be glad people don't have a clue \nabout the US Constitution, otherwise Politicians would use the U.S. \nMilitary to sort you out.\"*\n\nBy being a citizen, I am in a gang.  The Government is the leader of that \ngang.  By paying my taxes, I am paying my dues.  My buddies are the law \nenforcement agencies that I would call upon for help should anyone try to \noccupy 'my' land.\n\nI can't speak for the 'intellectual community' and how they should \nrationalize these historically-originated dilemmas but morality is about \nmaking decisions that result in doing more good than harm.  What good would \ncome from leaving the country in which they were probably born?  Would \ntheir land (or Manhatten apartment maybe) be returned to the Native \nAmerican tribe that used it last, or even first (who were then evicted by \nanother tribe?) - which of the '50 Nations' do you think should benefit?  \nEvery working American contributes to the wealth of the nation - should \nthey leave to return to their ethnic homeland then the US would be poorer \nfor it  - how would this be good for Native Americans?  The 'moral' thing \nto do would be to stay and help make the country stronger.\n\nConsider, a remote village - the villagers can grow enough food to feed 50 \npeople well and huts enough for everyone who wants one but no-one has the \nskills to heal the sick, deliver babies safely, train younger members of \nthe community, etc.  According to you, a doctor hearing of this chance to \nhelp the community should have conflicting thoughts - do they go to live in \nthe village and help the villagers or not do so because then there would \nnot be enough food and shelter for everyone to eat well and live \ncomfortably?  And your answer would be that they should stay the hell away.\n\nBy the way that you have used 'oxymoron' incorrectly, I would guess that \nyou are something of an anti-intellectual, not being one yourself.  It \ndescribes a self-contradictory figure of speech (\"Parting is such *sweet \nsorrow* \") - not a state of hypocrisy.\n\nWhat makes you think that 'Atheists' claim moral superiority?  I didn't \nthink that they did. Rational superiority maybe, but moral?\ufeff",

When you read Socrates, he writes of \ngods, a single God, and a godless universe. It is an important distinction. \nAgnosticism is a decided bias of \"not being sure if God exists,\" which is a \nvery particular viewpoint and suggests that a God can be defined as \nexisting or not existing. In its most traditional sense, atheism asserts \nthat official or common understandings and definitions of \nGod/Gods/Godlessness fall short under scrutiny. They can exist, or not \nexist, depending on the perception, depending on the definition, depending \non the individual or the collective and so on. It isn't a \"belief\" in \nanything.\n\nI realize this runs counter to the assertions of the so-called New Atheists \nlike Dawkins, Hitchens and Krauss, who are pretty much at war with \nestablished monotheism, but the roots and definition of atheism run much \ndeeper than that.",

The reason why we don't have the snake \ntalked me into it as a defense is because religious view is that we have \nfree will. We can listen to our conscious (which for Christians is the holy \nspirit) and never commit such evil acts. I just think this polar opposite \nthinking is unhealthy. It shouldn't be us vs them religious vs nonreligious \nwe should have open dialect about what people actually believe and how that \ninfluences their actions.  \n\nI agree that some things in the bible seem magical and therefore completely \nillogical but I would argue that the original texts use numbers differently \nthen how we use it today. Thousands of years ago not a lot of people knew \nhow to write or read so stories were passed down through word of mouth. \nNumbers like 40 in the bible meant just the right amount of time it didn't \nliterally mean 40 years to be exact. Many numbers in the bible are like \nthat they are part of the story, ways for people to remember the story. I \nwas an atheist like 3 weeks ago but then I started reading the new \ntestament and many of the parables and messages scream universal truth to \nme.
