            "text": "I have to disagree with you. You are visually using a 3-dimensional object, \nbut discussing a 1-dimensional one. \nWhen you say 1 pie should equal 1 pi, it does... A pie is a cylinder, and \nyou are assuming a unit circle here, so then we would assume similarly with \nour cylinder ( radius and height = 1). So volume of a cylinder (which is \nwhat you are measuring with a slice of pie) is pi*r^2*h, which in our \ncylinder is pi. So 1 pie=1 pi. \nEven if you are talking about a circle (2-dimensional), then a slice of \nthat circle deals with it's area. And area of a circle is pi*r^2, which in \na unit circle is pi. So one circle is pi. \nWhat you are discussing here, relating to trig, is circumference of a \ncircle, which is the measurement around the circle, in other words, the \nlength of your pie crust... not the pie itself. \nSo picture it like this, we measure our homes by square footage. This means \nif I have a square tile that is 1 ft wide by 1 ft long, it's area is 1 sq \nft. If I lay these throughout the house and count how many there are, this \nis the square footage of the home. However, if I then measure the \n(1-dimensional) perimeter of the same tile (distance around the tile), that \nis 1ft+1ft+1ft+1ft=4ft. So the distance around a square tile is 4 ft (not 1 \nft). Just like the distance around a circle is related to pi, but not equal \nto 1 pi.\nAnd I also have to say that your substitution of tau into Euler's formula \nremoves a large part of it's beauty for me. e^(i*pi)= -1 takes a positive \nnumber and raises it to a power (yes, it is a complex power) and gets a \nnegative number out of that. That's awesome, but your formula ends with a \npositive 1, which has slightly less umph for me.\ufeff",

One pie should equal one pi. Pi should've \nbeen equal to roughly 6.28 all along, but it's not. And that makes pi day \nconfusing (Do I eat one pie or one pi?). Tau is much neater than two pi, \nespecially since that quantity pops up all over the world of math and \nscience. My high school physics class just started circular motion and \ngravity, and there are several equations where two pi pops up. Every time I \nsee it, I grimace and change it to tau on my paper. Not only this, but when \nstudents are learning trigonometry, it would just be easier to have one \ncircle = one tau instead of two pi. I've heard my fellow students complain \nabout how ridiculous that is. You're right, Vi; math needs to be as elegant \nas possible, and the fact that we use the ratio of circumference to \ndiameter instead of radius is just plain ridiculous. The only problem I can \nsee with tau is that, at least in my physics textbook, it can be used to \nrepresent torque. Now I just have one question: on tau day, should I eat \none pi(e), or two?\ufeff",
