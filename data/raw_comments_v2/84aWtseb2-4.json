            "text": "Daylight savings time is like cutting off the bottom of a blanket and \nsowing it to the top, as the expression goes, however I see it that the \nbottom of the blanket is not being used (ie the early morning when most \npeople are asleep), whereas the top bit is (the evening). \n\nWe don't get anymore daylight in the day - that is impossible. \n\nIt is basically adjusting the daylight hours to when they're most useful. \nFor example, lets say in summer sunrise is 4am and sunset is 8pm. There is \nplenty of daylight, but who is around at 4am? By shifting the clocks an \nhour forward, sunrise is now 5am and sunset is at 9pm. There are far more \npeople who will benefit from daylight at 9pm than at 4am. The daylight is \nbetter used. \n\nYou may welk think, why not be on daylight saving time all year round. Well \nthat is possible, but probably not ideal. \n\nWherever you are, you are in a specific time zone for your \ncountry/state/region. The local time is decided by making 12 O'clock noon \nthe time when the sun is highest in the sky. This is also known as Standard \nTime. When we are on daylight saving time, that time that the sun is \nhighest in the sky is 1pm. When we are on Standard Time, there is more or \nless an equal number of daylight hours before and after noon. \n\nSo, for example, lets say in winter sunrise is 8am. That means on Standard \nTime, sunset is 4pm. There are four hours of daylight before and four hours \nof daylight after 12 O' Clock noon. If we were on daylight saving time in \nwinter, sunrise would be 9am and sunset would be 5pm. This would cause very \ndark mornings, with everyone waking up, going to work and school children \nwalking to school in the dark. \n\nWe could stay on Standard Time all year, and say to people \"if you want \nmore daylight in summer, get up earlier\" and leave it up to schools, \nbuisnesses etc, to set thier own hours. Whether they would though is \nanother question. I guess most people rely on the clock to tell them when \nto get up. \n\nOh well, let the clock changing tradition continue.\ufeff",

As I said before almost all commercially \nmade electronics have a surprising amount of lead on the circuit boards, so \nunless you plan to make ALL of your electronics your self with solder that \nis not lead based then it is something you will need to deal with. About \n0.25-0.75 mg of Hg that are actually released when you break a CFL bulb, \nwhich i don't imagine that dropping one would be easy. You could use LEDs \nas they are the best in terms of life time efficiency ( \nhttp://www.homedepot.com/b/Electrical-Light-Bulbs-LED-Light-Bulbs/N-5yc1vZbm79 \n) though the cost is higher.

I went poking around The Home Depot and found 2 \nLight bulbs that produce similar light colors and use the same equivalent \nwattage. The First bulb (an Incandescent bulb running at 100 Watts \nproducing soft white light) Cost $1.99 per bulb and had an estimated \nrunning time of 1,920 hours. The second bulb ( a CFL running at 23 Watts ( \nwhich is equivalent to the 100 Watts of a incandescent bulb) producing soft \nwhite light) The Cost per bulb was $2.99 and had an estimated running time \nof 12,000 hours. The first bulb produced up to 1,300 lumens and costs \n1.1005 cents per hour of use. While the second bulb produced upto 1,600 \nlumens and costs 0.2530 cents per hour of use (Hourly costs based on \n11cents/kWh)I'm not here to debate whether or not the ban was good , but I \ncan tell your with facts and without doubt that Incandescent bulbs do cost \nmore as you would need approximately 6.25 incandescent bulbs to last as \nlong as 1 CFL bulb. The CFL bulb only costs at most a few dollars more than \nan incandescent. The CFL bulb can also converts 9 -11% of its power to \nlight , whilst the incandescent converts only 2-5% of its energy to \nlight.In short CFLs are cheaper than incandescent light bulbs in the long \nrun. I am simply stating the facts I have found.
