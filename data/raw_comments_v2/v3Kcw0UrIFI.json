They would have a self guided \nmeans of getting around, a mouth and an anus, a way to reproduce. All the \nthings something must have to be LIVING, are difficult to hide. Even if \nsomething was a film across a vast expanse of a large area, it would in \nsome way display evidence of being alive. There would probably be more than \none. It might want to eat you. It might be lonely and be yearning for a \nlong time to make contact with something, someone, anything, from anywhere, \nto make sense of its own bizarre existence. How it came to be and get to \nlook the way it does etc.\n The chances of anything being hostile would be a slim window to hit. Or at \nleast dangerously hostile. From any time a living organism learns to make \nweapons etc and the time it masters space travel, would likely all happen \nwithin a time frame comparable to the life span of one of us. Hostile \nmissions are ill fated ones. Going at it alone is stupid and unrealistic. \nAnything of any interest out there will surely have its own interests. \nwhich may or may not include how to deal with visitors.\n I think its more realistic and proper to accept we, as humans, are bound \nto this rock and instead of feeling doomed we should feel lucky or \nfortunate, to be here for any length of time.\n So in a few short years when you die, what does it matter what happens to \nthe human race? Why should you or anyone give a fuck what happens to our \nfuture?\n Because they might include some of your descendants? Can you remember or \neven find out who yours were say, 200 years ago? A blink of an eye.\n OK, gettin off track here a bit.\n My main point was the futility of trying to reach and/or populate other \nworlds. If it ever is to happen, it probably already has, and, well, we are \nhere are we not?\n To carry on from here, from this particular one in a zillion rock we call \nEarth, this spectacularly perfect in so many ways we are so perfectly \nadapted to, will require methods we are not yet familiar with. And a \ndifferent comprehension of the time scale involved.\n Its a lonely cold dark thing to do is immerse yourself into an abyss of no \nsure outcome for an unknown duration at an unknown distance in a direction \nof impossible precision requiring quantity, for what? For all we know the \nclosest best place could have a day as short as a billionth of a breath you \ntake and a thousand of them could fit into a thimble while each one of them \nthinks they are alone using their best telescopes. \n In time, all things will come to be.

We \nmay not be able to survive there and they may not be able to survive here \nbut if we limit our search and only investigate earth like planets we can \npossibly miss the most intelligent of life that's out there.\n\nThis is why I think the more intense search now for earth like planets is \nmore *POLITICAL* and has more to do with colonization and resource \ngathering than it does with finding other intelligent life.
