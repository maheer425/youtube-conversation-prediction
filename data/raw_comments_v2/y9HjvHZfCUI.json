            "text": "Stalin wasn't necessarily a \"terrible leader\". This depends on which \naspects of his rule you focus on. You forget just how quickly USSR became \nindustrialized from a rural backward country in the 1917 to an industrial \nsuperpower in the 1930s under Stalin's initiative. This was growth \nunprecedented in speed and scale to any state. Without this rapid \nindustrialization it is unlikely USSR would have won the war in the first \nplace. Recall thousands of t-34s (quantity has a quality of its own)? They \nwould have been impossible without massive industrial factories. Unlike \nUSA, USSR was largely destroyed during the war yet already in 1953 they had \na first successful nuclear test. Stalin was a diligent study and a decent \nstrategist, having commanded entire Red Army fronts under Lenin. The very \nreason he blundered thinking Hitler wouldn't attack USSR is because he \ncould never imagine Hitler risking a war on 2 fronts, greatly \noverestimating his military intelligence. Those who say that it's the \nSoviet people and not Stalin who are responsible for victory (claiming \nSoviets won despite Stalin's blunders) have to explain why is it that the \nGerman people,  didn't win the war DESPITE Hitler's blunders? It's simply \nan absurd claim. One also has to realize that for every German soldier \nkilled on the Western front, - approximately 9 met their death on the \nEastern front (similar situation with technology). Eastern front (according \nto Wiki and other encyclopaedias) was 8-9 times more massive, which \ndemonstrates beyond doubt that Soviet Union had a far bigger role to play \nin defeating Hitler than all of its allies put together. Compared to \nHitler, - Stalin paid a lot more attention to his generals' assessment of \nthe situation and was also a better strategist. Unlike Hitler he was a \npragmatist and didn't believe in quick victory through superiority in \n\"spirit\" or ideology despite all odds, like Hitler did.\n\nI don't at all deny that Stalin was a ruthless person in his personal life \nand in the way he ran the state. He was extremely punitive and paranoid, \nhaving condemned to death millions of Soviet people, many of those - on \ntrumped up charges.  But that doesn't mean that he was an ineffective \nruler, to say that, -  is to lack historical objectivity. Ivan the Terrible \nwas also a bad person, and arguably so was Peter the Great but under their \nrule the Russian empire expanded in territory, gained in power and wealth \nand became an influential European player.  At the same time some of the so \ncalled \"democratic\" or \"more democratic\" Soviet and Russian leaders have \nbrought their country nothing but ruin and poverty to its people. (like \nYeltsin and Gorbatchev). Having said this I am not necessarily arguing that \nRussia can't possibly prosper under anything other than a tough, punitive \nauthoritarian dictatorship, but, that so far such was its \nunfortunate historic tendency, - to fair poorly under a more permissive \nleadership.\ufeff",

Is this not obvious?\n\nHere;s a quick recap:\n*You*: \"The term 'country' emphasizes the physical dimensions and \nboundaries of a geographical area\" \"the word 'country' is used to define \nthe geographical landmass they live on, and the neighbors they have\"\n*Me*: \"If countries are*only* geographic expanses of land...\"\n*You*: \"Show me exactly in my quote I said that?\"\n\nYou didn't even care to read your own quotes before replying. Lol, they \nliterally say, in plain English, that a country is a geographic area of \nland defined by certain borders. You clearly don't even believe or \nunderstand your own argument.\n\nAfter conceding on your ridiculous \"definition of a country\" phase, you \nsaid that *\"countries don't declare war, states (governments) do\"*.\nLet's look at some of our past declarations of war, and see whether \"The \nUnited States\" or \"The Government of the United States\" declares war:\n\nWar of 1812:\n*Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United \nStates of America in Congress assembled, That war be and is hereby declared \nto exist between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the \ndependencies thereof, and the United States of America and their \nterritories...*\n\nWorld War I:\n*...be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United \nStates of America in Congress assembled, That the state of war between the \nUnited States and the Imperial German Government...\"\n\nJust about every single one of our declarations of war follows similar \nlines, but I think you get the picture.\n\nI realize- why am I even arguing with you? You're going to make some \nlaughable attempt at an argument before resorting back to your \"I didn't do \nthis, I didn't do this\" rehetoric. It's an empty, misguided, and cheap \nfallacy. Can't wait for your reply.",

Capitalism in America allowed the rich  to keep their money \nand for the formation of private enterprise and huge \"evil\" corporations. \nIt reduced poverty. In spite of having more people, the USSR's GDP was less \nthan half of America's and their per capita GDP was far less than half of \nAmerica's. According to a former Soviet planner and economist Yuri Maltsev \n(look him up), Soviet poverty was appalling compared to America's, and at \nthe same time that Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were bringing the personal \ncomputer to individuals in America in the 1980s, Soviets had been reduced \nto a society of beggars and scavengers.\n\nTaking money away from all of the rich and giving it to all of the poor to \nmake sure that everyone was absolutely equal created devastating poverty. \nThe poor in the USSR were more than three decades behind the poor in \nAmerica in terms of income, healthcare, and what amenities they had, like \ncars, refrigerators etc. America was to the right of the USSR, and this \neconomic freedom allowed for the so-called \"trickle down\" effect to expand \nthe economy and help the poor. Poverty was off the charts in the Soviet \nUnion compared to America. When rich people could keep their money, they \nexpanded their businesses and hired more poor people, reducing their \npoverty level and increasing their standard of living. It is the difference \nof giving a man a fish (communism) or teaching him to fish (capitalism). \nThere was more wealth inequality in America, but the poor did better in \nAmerica compared to the poor of the USSR, where there was more equality of \nincome.\n\nThis made the Soviet system rickety and prone to a revolution. Reagan \noutspent the Soviets in the military sphere, and it bankrupted them. The \nSoviet military couldn't respond when revolutions broke out in Eastern \nEurope, and capitalism toppled communism in Eastern Europe and then in the \nUSSR. The whole Soviet system was held in place by the Soviet military, \nWhen it was bankrupted, the USSR collapsed. A similar left wing economic \nsystem can be seen playing out in Venezuela today. There are serious \nshortages in basic necessities, and the people are revolting, demanding a \nright wing economic system, although America is not engaging Venezuela in a \ncompetitive arms race. There are also Soviet-like systems in place in Cuba \nand North Korea. These places have severe shortages of food and other \nnecessities.\ufeff",
