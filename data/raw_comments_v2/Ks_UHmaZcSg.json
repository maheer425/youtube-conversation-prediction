            "text": "Ive gotten Deja Vu mutiple times and everytime i got it, i recognized that \nit was something i had experienced in another lifetime. It wasnt just a \nfeeling of familiarity, it was an experience that was so precise so crystal \nclear, i knew it was more than my mind playing tricks on me. It was \nsomething greater... An external memory... Let me explain; An external \nmemory is something that you experience in a life cycle that your mind has \nsaved as a check point or as a message to ones own self, that you will \nrecognize in the same life experience but in another moment in time. \nBringing you to an alternate reality and sense of familiarity. To \nunderstand this, you have to first understand time and more importantly, \nlife. Time has no beginning or end. \"How is this relative to Deja Vu?\" Its \nrelative because the mind and the universe are one, traveling from \nexperience to experience. Deja Vu is like forseeing the future, except the \nfuture doesnt exist because time doesnt actually exist. In reality, it just \nrepeats. Its possible that through this infinite space and time, our lives \nrepeat an infinite amount of times, and at any given moment your mind takes \na snap shot of certain moments in a life cycle. This is what Deja Vu is. It \nhas nothing to do with epilepsy.. Or schizophrenia... Or any other brain \ndisorder. Its also possible that Deja Vu and destiny coexist. \"How is this \npossible? And why?\" You might ask... Well In external form the mind is in a \nstate of perfection. Meaning we are in a state of perfect being. We know no \ngreed, no pain, no fear, no emotions, no urges or sensations of the senses \nwe gain from having a physical form. Because we arent in a physical form we \nare nothing but intelligence. Destiny would be described as our spiritual \nbeings choosing a forseen path. Almost like a challenge of will power. We \nare all destined to be great. So we choose a predetermined path. But as we \njourney through a life experience in physical form we stray from our \ndestined course. Maybe Deja Vu is a message to our physical being from our \nspiritual being, a message of/for good or bad, a message to relay ones own \ncourse of actions wether it is the right course or not. A checkpoint or a \nwarning. See science can only explain so much. And its often innaccurate, \nand denotes the truth, persuading others to believe something false. When \nin fact, our thoughts are telling us the truth. The mind is a powerfull \nthing. You cant always rely on scientific explainations. \n\nFor example, the \"Big Bang Theory\". Its simply just a theory. It denotes a \nuniversal intelligence or a higher power, stating that life is random. But \nif life began from cosmic gases, then ill simply ask, what created those \ngases? And if something created those gases, then again, ill ask, what \ncreated that?? same thing can be asked about \"god\". Who or what created \ngod? And if so, what created that?? Theres always a new question to arise \nwith every answer. The questions become infinite, as well as the answers \ndo, until you reach the easiest explaination... Nothing. In the beginning \nthere was nothing. Nothing but black, empty, darkness. But if life and all \nthings began from nothing, than truly nothing is everything, because all \nthings derived from nothing. This is how we know time is actually infinite, \nand if time is infinite than it is also irrelevant. Why? Because if time is \ninfinite, life is infinite as well, and there is nothing to fear. The truth \nis life has no beginning or end. Yes our lives do...but that is the purpose \nof physicality. What we are experiencing in this moment is all we know. Its \nall we wanted to know, for a brief moment of infinity. This is the purpose \nof life, to experience. What is beyond this we only imagine. \n\n\ufeff",

            "text": "Typical. What about when people dream something, then it actually happens? \n I guess \"science\" would call that person a \"kook\" or a \"quack\".  As he was \nbabbling on about theoretical parallel universes and differing frequencies \noccupying the same space, and how it is a matter of tuning into them, he is \nlending credence to one of the principle embarrassments of science: the \ninability to explain how the brain generates consciousness.  It would be \nmuch more plausible to view the brain as a receiver of consciousness, as \nthere is no scientific evidence to support the assumption that \nconsciousness is generated by the brain...and no expense or effort has been \nspared in the process, much to its collective chagrin.\n\nWhile there may be some truth to fragmented memories being seized upon by \nthe brain to trigger the onset of deja vu, the \"problem\" isn't quite so \nsimple.  Deja vu can be so undeniably visceral and pointed in one's \nexperience (can't quantify, calculate, weigh, or measure it, sorry) that \nits reality is not to be denied.  That's a good thing, actually.  It tunes \nyou in to the fact that this universe is infinitely mysterious, and our \nparticipation as humans is also mysterious.  Science is a wonderful \ninvention of and by mankind to understand this universe, but it is limited \nin its applications due to its inherent utilitarian nature.  Phenomena such \nas deja vu clue us in to that very fact, and that is to be acknowledged and \nrespected, as it presupposes the transcendence of time and space.  Some \nthings are simply beyond rational explanation.\ufeff",

I can personally say \nthat at some points in my life I have managed to tap in and out of parallel \nrealities by tapping into an entirely different thought pattern and belief \nsystem and have witnessed real-time changes in my environment/interactions \nwith other people. Example: if you visualize and change your belief system \nthat the place you are walking is dangerous, you tap into a reality where \nactual dangers will suddenly manifest themselves as a part of your reality, \nbecause you are now on this frequency and subject to that particular \nreality, yet in the same exact environment you change your belief \nsystem/visualize that location being a safe oasis and all of a sudden, \nbehold you are on this frequency and other things on this frequency/reality \nstart manifesting themselves in real time (you hear children laughing/play, \nyou encounter friendly people) - It's more than a matter of perception, \nthoughts have actual power to change physical reality in an obvious way. \nAlmost every teaching/theory relating to this all has the same message but \nexplained in a different way. From religious scholars, motivational \nspeakers, now even physicists. If this theory be true, I believe *some* \npeople that our society labeled mentally ill or those with hallucinations \nmay in fact tapped into a reality or frequency where what they are \nexperiencing/things they are seeing are part of a parallel dimension. In \nour eyes these people are crazy, but their experience, their existence, \ntheir thoughts, their visions are a *reality* for them, just because it is \nanother reality from what we're experiencing doesn't make theirs any less \nvalid or real from their personal experiences. \ufeff",

            "text": "My family's DNA \"has been here\" as long as skilled ancient farmers have \nbeen here, and stone cutters, and carpenters, and ship builders, I am \nliving in a Deja Vu, everywhere I am. I can close my eyes and imagine \nancient times, and even be in ancient times, in my mind for a few moments; \nand it's real, in my mind. My DNA has been there and done that. I can't \nbelieve people are STILL functioning in a lost, misguided, psychologically \ndamaged social atmosphere, war proud on a religion for money foundation; \nwherein slave blood was used in place of water to mix the concrete. Deja \nVu. You probably do NOT remember that in ancient \"Greece\" and beyond, it \nwas virtually REQUIRED that YOU and YOUR FAMILY be present at the public \nrally to SUPPORT a political \"leader,\" then ALSO thought of as being \n\"royalty.\"  If you were NOT present in ancient times to praise the leader \nand is/her court of body guards, you had better have a real good \nexplanation or you could lose a lot of your social status and position.  If \nYOU, in ancient/modern times did NOT believe that God \"appointed\" SOME FEW \nfamilies of waste producers to \"lead the masses of humans\" towards a better \nlife; you may not understand the Deja Vu of ancient Sparta and later Rome; \nthe foundations of their downfalls. Remember, Sparta was a loud proud drunk \nviolent military sex city that \"voted\" to oust the government of Tantalus, \nand replace it with the politics of Zeus. (Rome came later, vowing to NOT \nmake the same mistakes as the Phrygians; using the Phrygians methods of \ndoing everything.)  Agamemnon, the \"leader\" of the \"troops\" that attacked \nTroy, was the great grandson of Tantalus, who was the first Great King of \nancient Phrygia. This Deja Vu, my Deja Vu, is lost to the world. The battle \nof Troy was NOT about sex rights to Helen of Troy; it was about economics, \ni.e. the location of Troy and Trojan beaches; and their immediate access to \npre-existing ground routes to and from civilizations; and TAXES being \nlevied on all the goods that passed through Troy. The Queen of Hatti, Hatti \nbeing the land where Troy was located, was a Phrygian.  The goal of the \nPhrygians was to bridge the political, religious, and economic gaps between \nthe Hittites and the Egyptians, which was a monumental task, but it was \nworking, slowly.  Zeus types and advocates (ancient political party) \nderailed this effort with false accusations against Tantalus, the \"leader\" \nof the OTHER political party that had been leading the way for decades. \n The crowd of Zeus wanted a political/tax/war/CONTROL of everything, who \nwith \"their elite group,\" had the spear and sword and \"law\" needed at the \ntime to kill at will and ask questions later; identical to the scene today, \nonly in modern terms, Deja Vu. Leaders of the ancient groups who were NOT \nPhrygians WANTED to be.  Zeus was a first cousin to the Phrygian family. \nThe Phrygians later LOST their under pinning net work control of 3,000+ \nyears of \"civilizing\" the primitive barbarians in a collection of \n\"in-house\" political back stabbing coo scandals (set of scandals that led \nto the fall of Egypt for example) that led to the demise, over the next \nseveral hundreds of years, to replace the Phrygian way with the Zeus \nmethods, turn life into a scrambled mess of tax and war chaos, and here we \nare, Deja Vu, living in the time where the arrogant attitude of the Zeus \ntypes of people have replaced the sword and spear backed law with gun \nbacked law. We are back in ancient Sparta all over again, the entire \ncountry. Remember, Xerxes sent a messenger to Sparta before the battle of \nthe 300 that is so widely misrepresented in dramatic commercial Deja Vu \nGreek Myth fake movies of the actual event of the slaughter of the 300; and \nwhy the following destruction of Sparta took place. Do you all remember?  I \ndo, it's Deja Vu in my DNA. The stimulus that powers my Deja Vu experience \nIS the media talking about the political, religious, traditional, war, \n sex, greed Deja Vu being pounded into the minds of misled Humans when they \nare children; who are later as adults, held into submission with laws to \nprotect the law makers, who claim to be protecting the masses; but who LIE, \nDeja Vu; and it all seems so real, because it is, in our DNA, not just \nmine; a lot of us anyway.  Yes, the mind is a sensitive thing.  The \nsensation that \"we're being lied to again\" means the same as \"I've been \nhere before.\"  The Spartans killed the messenger, thus the Greek \"myth\" \nthat led to the destruction of Sparta by \"United (15 or so united cities \nwho wanted an end to Spartan behavior patterns) Nations,\" and the phrase \n(phrase is a Phrygian word); \"don't kill the messenger\" originates. The \nSpartans learned, what \"you should not have done that!!!\" meant AFTER \nkilling the messenger asking for peaceful talks, that, they should have NOT \n\"done that\" (killed the messenger).  Spartan \"leaders,\" had a Deja Vu, and \nrealized they \"should have not have done that!\" (Killed the messenger). The \nSpartan \"leaders\" sent a messenger to Xerxes and apologized for the killing \nof their messenger; who sent the messenger back to the Spartan leaders with \nthe message, \"it is too late to apologize.\"  Sparta was destroyed.  Deja \nVu. The position of America in the world today is identical to the position \nof ancient Sparta before Sparta was destroyed by a team of military \ncombatants from a group of United Nations.  The U.S. military IS building a \nspider web of locations for an all out military style war in this country; \nor better said perhaps; the people who are the United States \ngovernment/military are strengthening the web that already exists.  Masses \nof slaves are always expendable in war, regardless of the form of war; its \nall terrorism.  The Deja Vu experience could be a partial result of a \ncombination of things, such as but not limited to the more than moderate \nuse of alcohol, alcohol mixed with prescription pills, THC, cocaine, meth, \ncrack, porn, commercials on the tv, work environment conditions of toxic \ncontact, city air or water consumption, some or all or other like \ninfluences similar to the aforementioned influences; simultaneous \nconsumptions; in the last two days. Hope this message influences and \ntriggers a pleasant Deja Vu for you.          \ufeff",

Anyway, evolution \nhas roots in a racist philosophy; as in the stronger resemblance of certain \nhuman race backgrounds to other life forms in what appears to be an string \nof related life forms; humans having the highest ability to use life \nenergy, in the zones of our ability TO see what is really possible.

Science and math are valuable \ntools, religion is a crutch and an opiate, politics are a scam, the \ninvestment \"industry\" is a ponzi scheme, and people say it is going to \"get \nworse.\"  Does that mean push button war or a savage door to door killing \nlooting rampage?  We stopped evolving around 200,000 years ago, but we have \nmodified our original survival and purpose strategies.

In fact, the LEADING cause of death in THIS country IS \"medical \nmalpractice.\" Statistics (math) are used in psychology on a large scale; so \nis simple addition, as in adding up the number of abortions and alcohol \nrelated accidents.  One example of the use of psychology, for example, a \nfew Arab Muslims could NEVER penetrate U.S. security and alleged \n\"intelligence\" and pull off 9-11 with such ease; WITHOUT inside help; like \nfrom the CIA who DOES go WAY overboard in \"extracting evidence\" from \n\"heroes\" of other nations; you know, troops (slave population martyrs) who \ndefend THEIR freedom of religion \"God\" when the U.S. attacks THEIR country \nover nuclear weapons paranoid suspicions, and oil and gas revenues for the \ndecadently wealthy CEO's of international companies who have multi-million \ndollar homes in a few places and multi-million dollar yachts and 20 \nmistresses. If you think otherwise, you are simply a victim of the \ndeception that can be achieved by the use of psychology in the negative. A \nmuch larger use of a negative deception LIE through the application of \npsychology is the perpetuation of the Jesus coming back lie to \"save\" \npeople from the \"teachings\" based in \"forgiving sins\" of the government \npeople.  Realize this and accept this; the government schools and churches \nhave been slaughtering masses of poor slaves with psychology based LIES \nover the last many decades.  Yes, larger populations DO help the government \npeople acquire a lot of money in taxes, but thongs do get out hand when \npoor people reproduce with no real concept of their religious reproductive \nactions.  Today, the mentality of the NEW generations of \"video gamers\" is \npretty much summed up as, \"well, WE are the future NOW.
