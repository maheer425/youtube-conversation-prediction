Furthermore \nwhat effect vikings had on the royal dynasties that would dominate European \npolitics for another thousand years. William the Conqueror was Norman (who \nwere Norse, not French, in ethnicity) and Rurik's (the first prince of \nNovogorod) descendants ruled Kiev, Moscow and Russia until the 17th Century \nfor example.
