This personally makes the Nissan (Datsun) more appealing \nin many different aspects which is may not be that obvious. I first saw a \nNissan gtr back when I was travelling up and down the m3 to my place of \nwork, the stance of the car is just so intimidating to all other road user, \nand from that point on I was truly convinced that this was a dark horse of \nthe motoring world, you only have to read the technical stats of this car \nand you will have the Italians And Germans shaking in there boots. The \nthing that really struck me is how a company such as Nissan can sell such a \nwide range of cars but still manage to develop a car which will give you \nthe performances of super car with the reliability and use ability to rival \nBMWs m range and Audi's quattro and RS ranges\ufeff",

And the latest \nM3 does have a turbo, and those Audis you love don't.\n\nRWD is actually better in some areas. It has less understeer, more balance \nand maybe even more precision if done right. It does have less traction and \ngrip but if the tyres are thick and sticky enough it doesn't matter. That \nis why F1 cars and LMP1 cars still use RWD. But at the same time AWD suits \ncertain prices, types, shapes of cars and in the case of the GTR (and \nSubaru and Evo) it is better. ",
