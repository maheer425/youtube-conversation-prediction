However, it has \nalways bothered me that we refer to some infinities as 'bigger' than \nothers. I prefer the word 'denser'. For example, {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3} \ncontains seven elements (regardless of what we choose to label them) that \ncan be counted with the first seven natural numbers (1 above -3, 2 above -2 \nand so on up to 7 above 3). Perhaps a clearer example is to consider all \nrational numbers between 0 and 1, an infinite number. Yet, the distance \nbetween 0 and 1 is one for natural numbers and also for rationals (or any \nother). The only difference being that the space between 0 and 1 is empty \nfor natural numbers but infinitely dense for the rationals.

Technically speaking infinity can't be reached, but \ncan't it be... viewed? Like, continuously halving the number one will never \nget you to 0, but it will get you close. So wouldn't that also occur if you \nsimply multiplied? By two, by three, by a billion, whatever. Eventually you \nwould get a number so immense, it would seem to be infinity. Then you could \nmultiply it by itself. Exponentials. You would always get a bigger number, \nlike how you would get a smaller one by dividing, but the difference would \neventually be so miniscule as to seem non-existent.

In this way, for every \npositive integer, there exists a real number between 0 and 1 which matches \nto it like this. \n\nHowever, after you've done this, you've in a sense \"used up\" all of the \nintegers, but you've only used real numbers between 0 and 1. The integer \n249374... matches up to 0.249374..., but doesn't it also match up to \n1.249374...? And 2.249374..., and 3.249374, and 4.249374, and so on.

I had to relearn the same algebra in \ncollege that I'd forgotten in high school. Now that I've graduated, I don't \nremember any of the maths I learned in college. I want to like math; but it \nseems like I have to do it consistently, over and over, or else it leaks \nout of my brain. But it's not like if you don't read a book for six months \nyou forget out how to read. I wish maths were similar.\ufeff",

            "text": "+Simple1DEA Yeah, this is a tough concept. There are rigorous proofs of \nthese things that use crazy math, but I'll try to explain it without that \nstuff (just so you know that this has been rigorously defined).\n\nLet's say you were trying to match each integer with a real number in a \none-to-one fashion. Given an integer, say 438, you could match it with the \nreal number 0.438. Similarly, you could match the integer -1024 to the real \nnumber -0.1024. (And you could match 4380 to 0.0438, 43800 to 0.00438, etc.)\n\n\nI think it's pretty clear that, using this method of matching, if you take \nany integer, no matter how large, there exists a real number between -1 and \n1 which you can match it to. It should also be clear that no two integers \nmatch to the same real number. \n\n\nSo, consider the integer 31. You could match it to 0.31. But then, couldn't \nit also match to 1.31? And 2.31? And 3.31, 4.31, 5.31, .......? You've \n\"used up\" all of the integers and matched \"all\" of them to real numbers \nbetween -1 and 1. But then you have all the real numbers less than -1 and \ngreater than 1 you haven't taken into account.\n\n\nThis obviously isn't a proof, but hopefully it convinces you that there are \n\"more\" real numbers than integers. Formally, we say the real numbers are \nuncountably infinite while the integers are countably infinite, like was \ndescribed in the video.\n\n\nThe real numbers are \"dense.\" Dense is a mathematical term, but you can see \nwhy it's called that; there are just so many real numbers that the number \nline is dense with numbers. If you list all of the integers on the number \nline you have tons of gaps everywhere but if you list all the real numbers \nthere are no gaps. For example, there is no smallest (in terms of absolute \nvalue) real number. If you take any super small real number, like \n0.00000000.....00001, you can always keep dividing by 2 indefinitely to get \na smaller real number. This is another property of the real numbers that \nshows that there are just \"so many\" of them.",

Then it started to go the \nother way; a plain was made of an infinite number of lines, an infinite \nnumber of points, no beginning or end in two dimensions. Space was the same \nin three dimensions. Then geometric shapes were like line segments in two \nor three dimensions. I was pretty excited to realize that various geometric \nobjects had varying degrees of infinity. Was even more excited when it \noccurred to me that this applied to numbers too. I was immensely \ndisappointed when not only did my teacher and classmates share my \nexcitement but they did not even get it.

            "text": "Why is the unlistable infinity considered bigger than the listable \ninfinity? Since between any two distinct reals there is at least one \nrational (an infinite number of rationals in fact) how can the number of \nreals be bigger than the number of rationals? \n\nConsider the first number on your list in your Cantor proof \nexample, 0.1213712912\u2026. You haven't really specified a number there, you \nhave just written down the initial decimal expansion of some number that is \npresumably specified elsewhere. If there is really a list, then for each \nnumber on the list, there will somewhere need to be some finite sequence of \nmathematical symbols that actually refers to the specific number.\n\nEach of these sequences of symbols will refer to a number that has a \ndecimal expansion that begins with a sequence of digits, so your proof is \nvalid, but the actual specification of the number cannot be an infinite \nsequence of mathematical symbols or a partial decimal expansion. It has to \nbe something with a specification of finite length that refers to a \nspecific number, something like e/pi or sqrt(3).\n\nBut the set of possible finite sequences of mathematical symbols is \nlistable. You can start with all possible symbol sequences of length 1, \nlength 2, and so on. This list will contain every real number that it is \npossible to mention, because every possible specification will appear \nsomewhere on the list.\n\nThis list will thus include all of the numbers you can put on any specific \nCantor list, and it will also contain the number you constructed that \ncannot be on that Cantor list. It doesn't violate the Cantor proof because \nit also includes other sequences of mathematical symbols that don't refer \nto numbers (they could even be meaningless sequences of symbols). Your \nproof is about lists that contain only numbers, my list avoids your proof \nbecause it contains other things in addition to all the numbers that can be \nspecified.\n\nSo, although I agree that the real numbers are not listable, it doesn't \nappear to be because there are too many to list. The Cantor proof shows \nthat the set of reals that can be mentioned is not a listable set, but a \nset that includes all those reals and more is listable. So the unlistable \nset of reals that can go on a Cantor list (i.e. that can be specified) is \nnot larger than the set of integers.\n\nOf course, in some sense it appears that there are real numbers that won't \nappear on my list either, but as there is no way to refer to any of them it \nis not entirely clear to me what it means to say that such numbers exist.\n\nI'm interested in the idea that there might exist numbers that cannot be \nspecified. I like to call them \"mystical numbers\". You can believe in them, \nand perhaps even prove in some abstract sense that they must exist, but \ncannot point to any of them, cannot experience them. They are, in that \nsense, beyond conception. Since Mathematics is entirely symbolic, what does \nit mean to say that such numbers exist in Mathematics when there is no \nsymbolic expression that specifically represents any of them?\ufeff",
