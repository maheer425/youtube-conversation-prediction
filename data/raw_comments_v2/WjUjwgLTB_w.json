Bmw drivers are wankers and so on. Anyway, \nthe days of the 850R are long gone (what a silly car by the way a station \nwagon or saloon with 2.4l and a turbo with a gauge where petrol and temp is \nand about 220-260bhp). Those 850s can do half a million miles if certain \nfilters like dpf are changed when they should be. Volvos are pioneers of \nsafety, spacious, comfortable, luxurious interiors with world leading \nwinter driving (one can be set to turn on every day before you leave your \nhouse for work so it is all heated up and demisted deiced etc!!!) and have \ntop speeds up there with BM and Mercedes, they definitely need to start \nbringing out a 'M', 'AMG' or the like!\ufeff",
