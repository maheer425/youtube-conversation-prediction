Down there the temperatures are comparable \nto the surface of mars and there is actually an atmosphere you can breathe. \nI am not saying at all that we shouldn't be exploring mars right now, quite \nthe contrary. I am just concerned that it may be a little illusory to say \nwe can settle it with current technology if nobody is even bothering to set \nup permanent homes on numerous places back here on earth.\ufeff",

A sort of jump start, if you will. \nIf we do this, we can repopulate this ancient extinct planet, and rather \nfrom it being a dusty wasteland, perhaps we can make a new home that is \nsuitable here. I mean, the orbit around the sun allows it to be the \nnecessary temperature to life. But that doesn't mean that life needs our \nrequirements. Chemosynthesis may occur on mars, but more of a twist than \nearth. Perhaps rather then volcanic vents in H2O, perhaps radiation from \nthe sun can help Chemosynthesis occur. We don't know that for sure, but \nperhaps it is. We won't know, until we actually investigate this \npost-apocalyptic wasteland.\ufeff",
