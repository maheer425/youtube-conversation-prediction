            "text": "+Martin Smith He's speaking economically - Australia's GDP is nearly twice \nas large as Indonesia's. It's common to measure a nation via GDP because \neconomy is a prime factor in determining military power.\n\nAustralia has a significantly more powerful navy, and they have a lot more \nequipment army-wise too. Additionally, Australia has alliances with NZ and \nthe US, while Indonesia has no strong military alliance to speak of. \n\nGiven that Indonesia is a series of islands, it's extremely vulnerable to \nnaval attack. As a result, any conflict between Australia and Indonesia \nwould be laughably one sided, at least at this point.\n\nIn the future, I don't doubt that Indonesia will exceed Australia's \nstrength, but in the meantime anyone that claims that Indonesia would \ndefeat Australia knows very little about militaries in general.\n\nNow, that said, I hope there never is a real conflict with our neighbours, \nsince in general I see no reason for us to fight besides the bickering of \nsilly politicians on both sides ;)",
