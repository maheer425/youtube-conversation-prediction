It needs a few viewings, about \nevery two years perhaps.  It was made long before much had been written \nabout Quantum Theory and the ability of the viewer to affect what he sees \nand yet the fact that the characters can create what happens through their \nconsciousness reflects Quantum Theory.  Chris finds out that if we live \nwith love and compassion, only then can we create what is worthwhile, only \nthen can we move forward in this vale of soul-making here on earth. Here on \nearth we are never allowed to see God, only occasionally might we feel his \nlove and compassion, like the light coming through the round windows of the \nspacecraft.  But when we feel compassion and connectedness with the rest of \nhumanity, whether it is living and sharing in the suffering of others or \nwhatever, then we grow.  Chris does go home after learning to love his \nwife.  The ocean  then encourages him with one more vision it sends him to \ngo back to his father.  Then he goes home to his father, whom he will tell \nhe loves before his father dies and leaves this earth with the knowledge \nhis son loves him. The spacecraft is suffused with the mystery of our quest \nto find out more about life.  But to complete the circle, we need peace, \nwhich is why Chris returns home.\ufeff",

            "text": "Im Russian. when i was 16-17 i watched this movie first time.I couldn't \nfinish watching it as I was bored to tears...This movie was made back in \n1973, the year i was born. Then i watched it again when I was in my late \n20-s. the second \"attempt\" was more successful, I finally purchased the \nwhole version with Engl. subs about 5 years ago. The story is incredibly \npainful and incredibly beautiful at the same time. The main character, \nChris, arrives to the station which is influenced by the mysterious Ocean \nwhich is capable of \"reproducing\" the people who were long gone on Earth \nlife, but as those long gone people still remained in people's hearts and \nmemories, they \"reappear\" again. Chris wife committed suicide many years \nago leaving Chris with the feeling of guilt and confusion, loss and pain \nfor years. She felt emotionally neglected by him in real life....Anyways, \nthis movie is really difficult to just explain like this, its complicated. \nThe Ocean works with human consciousness...letting \"station\" people meet \nagain with the ones they wronged or hurt in Earth life, as if they would \nhave another chance to resolve the conflict, or experience love in more \ndeep mature and humanly compassionate way as it is depicted with Chris and \nhis gone wife...I recommend watching this movie seriously, this is a \ndifferent kind of science fiction. This movie became precious to me from \nall perspectives...I watch it nearly once in two-three years period, and I \nlove it.\ufeff",

Surely he would not get sent on the station and \nnot be expected to report back frequently too? And why was he sent alone? \nLets send just one person there...makes sense DOH\n\nOH I liked the bit with the door where it buckles when Hari trying to get \nthrough\n\nI like long films if there is going to be some \"money shot\" or wtf type or \nsublime revelation ending...this is why 2001 stands the best of \ntime...Kubrick knew you have to let the viewers have something after having \nthe patience to sit through slow stuff...so we got the \"trip\" ending with \nthe Starchild and all that other crazy stuff...unless the ending is \nradically different from the 2002 version we will have a flat ending\ufeff",
