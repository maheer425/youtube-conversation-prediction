I wrote a lengthy response and it dissappeared ... :(\n\nWell... again...\n\nI'll give you some explanations that are \"inside the story\" and then an \n\"outside the story\" explanation...\n\nInside the story you can think that Frodo needed to develop strong enough \nwillpower to continue his quest. Also it is implied that the Eagles are \nservants of Manw\u00eb, one of the Angelic rulers of Valinor, and that Manw\u00eb \ndoes not want to meddle too directly into the events of Middle-earth \n(earlier direct interventions had caused quite a bit of suffering) and that \nthe Ring is something that the peoples of Middle-earth must solve \nthemselves in order to grow up. I find certain aspects of this explanation \nsatisfying for me but I can relate to people who are not convinced.\n\nOutside the story explanation goes like this: Tolkien was very anti-modern \nperson in some aspects. He vehemently opposed something that can only be \ndescribed as \"the Machine\". With this concept he did not only mean the \ntechnology of his time, but human endeavor to find alternative solutions to \nproblems that could be solved better by development of human person and \nvirtues. Let me attempt to explain... :\n\nTechnology/science and \"magic\" are quite resent concepts and if we apply \nthese concepts to Renaissance period or Early Modern period we are quite \nanachronistic. You can consider the famous saying: \"any technology \nsufficiently developed will be indistinguishable from magic\". Heyday of \nmany \"magical\" practices (horoscopes, alchemy, Faustian necromancy) \noccurred in the same time as the emergence of modern science. They both \nwork in the same principle: we can make apparatuses through which we can \naffect physical world and dominate it. Only way we now can distinguish \n\"magic\" from \"technology\" is by hindsight... what did work is science and \nwhat did not work we label as magic or superstition.\n\nThe crux of the issue is that we want to find ways to dominate this world \nand other persons. It can happen for example through science or magic. \nTolkien considered travelling by foot to be superior for inner human \ndevelopment and for the growth of that person in virtues when compared to \n\ntravelling by train for example. That might be one reason why the book has \nso much walking. Humans want to have \"power\" so they develop means by which \nthey shorten the distance between desire and its fulfillment, between \nbeginning and the end, so that it is finally brought to nought. \n\nWhen it comes to travelling, it can happen by technology (train) or by \n\"magic\" (flying carpet, teleportation etc), when the natural for human \nwould be to travel by foot. This also brings us more fulfillment. Train and \nteleportation in this context are both representatives of \"the Machine\". It \nnullifies space and time. It is also a deceit, because there is really no \nmore space and time to be ruled when they are brought to zero. (Of course I \ndo not try to say that ALL train traveling is evil, but I hope you get my \npoint).\n\nIn these days the example of these kind of aspirations is transhumanism. \nSometimes I think that if people really become inpatient enough, could it \nand up that some might plug themselves into machines that give them the \nstimuli they want right when the desire is born, be it sensual, visual, \nauditive or some other kind of desire. Then those people would just float \nin the utter annihilation of space and time and any human effort or \ndevelopment of human person or virtues. In the book the ultimate machine is \nthe One Ring. It is made by Sauron to coerce the material world and other \nwill and minds. That is why it must be destroyed. If Gandalf or Aragorn \nused the Ring, they would end up forcing the world and other people to \nagree with them \"for their own good\".",

Besides, Sauron gave the other rings to \nMen and Dwarves, so they took them as gifts.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring (the conflict that takes place in the Lord of \nthe Rings book) Sauron did not need the One Ring to win. He had plotted for \nthree thousand years and Gondor, although relatively strong, was no match \nto all the realm subject to Sauron. Sauron also had his physical body \nformed, he did not need the One Ring to that.\n\nSauron wanted to have the One Ring so that he could know what had been done \nwith the Three Elven Rings during these three thousand years. These rings \nwere linked into the One so that if Sauron got the One Ring back he would \nbasically know all the plots and secrets of his greatest enemies (Elrond, \nGaladriel, Gandalf and C\u00edrdan). \n\nSauron also wanted to get the Ring back because he did not want anyone else \nto use it against him. Unlike these videos assume, the Ring could have been \nused by others. Even Frodo could have used it to bend weaker persons to his \nwill if he had such aspirations and had trained his mind to control, coerce \nand dominate other persons. Some other persons like Gandalf, Galadriel or \nElrond could have used the Ring effectively against Sauron, provided they \nhad enough time to learn how to master the Ring. And Aragorn could have \nused the Ring against Sauron. When Aragorn reveals himself to Sauron in the \nHelm's Deep via the palantir and wrestles the palantir away from Sauron's \ncontrol, Sauron is terrified since he thinks that now Aragorn has the Ring. \nThat is why he is too hasty and launches his invasion before he is ready \nand orders his armies to try to storm Minas Tirith instead of starting a \nlong siege.\n\nAnd Eagles could not have carried the Hobbits to the Sammath Naur where the \nRing was forged. If anyone had noticed the approaching Great Eagles, then I \nassume that Sauron could have just ordered few hundred archers near the \nDoor of Sammath Naur and the plan would have been foiled. And Gandalf did \nnot mean Eagles. \"Fly\" is synonymous with \"flee\" here.",

Celembrimbor gave Galadriel the \nring of water, and we note her connection to her \"seeing pool\" in \nLothlorien. I can't remember if we're told the larticular affinity of the \nring given to Elrond, but I wouldn't be surprised if Rivendell bears some \nmark associated with that Ring's \"personality\".\n\nSo, give a ring to a warrior and they become an unstoppable juggernaut. \nGive it to Legolas and he becomes an arrow gatling gun. Give it to a sneaky \nhobbit and he becomes super sneaky. Give it to Sam and he becomes super \nbrave. \n\nBut I suspect that over time the user's mastery of a ring deepens and the \nbenefits become more subtle and profound - they become a kind of idealism, \ngreater version of themselves. The Lord of the Nazgul becomes more than \njust a fearsome warrior but a great general and commander. Elrond becomes \nwise and far seeing. Galadriel becomes so ethereal she begins to seem more \nlike a Maia than an Elf. Gandalf becomes wise and self-effacing, with an \nability to see the big picture that dwarfs even Elrond and Galadriel. \nGollum became a monster in part because thats the particularly evil natute \nof the One, but also because, at bottom, that's who he was - a jealous \ncousin-murdering petty cutthroat. \n\nOne of the things I like about the Shadow of Mordor game is how it portrays \nthe way the One influenced Celebrimbor - he became a shining, beautiful, \ngraceful figure, bent for originally righteous reasons on vengeance and \ndomination. \"Bright Lord\" indeed. And the way Talion is similarly corrupted \nseems to me to be part of this too...\ufeff",
