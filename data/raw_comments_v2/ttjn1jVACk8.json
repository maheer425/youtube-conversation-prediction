I think racist ab \nteachers have destroyed the lives of many good innocent people. Whats the \nreason for this? I don't mess with innocent people. Most people can't think \nas deep as I can.   I refuse to think that anyone is better for not having \nmy blood type. I think we should do as were supposed to by not letting our \ntype being discriminated against and stop people from killing us.  Do you \nreally need to have a certain blood type to have a college degree or job? \nThat is a pretty bad life not having a job or a degree. Nobody cares about \nanyone else feelings. I was failed out of college. I know there is nothing \ni can do to change it. On every job resume I put no college. I have a \ncomplete disrespect towards the human education system People are so \nstupid. There are four known human blood types, A, B, O, AB. If 5 type A \npeople, 5 Type B people, 5 type O people and 5 type AB people were placed \nin the room and you had to put a answer on every persons blood type. 25 % \nby guessing. if it mattered it wouldn't be a guess. If you can't get at \nleast 75 % of the peoples blood type correct. You don't have a right to say \nit matters. Greys anatomy disect, open organ surgeries. If it mattered so \nmuch you would correctly be able to identify every persons blood type by \ndoing research on a legitimate source of information upon the topic.  I \nheard that the rh factor effects your biology more than the type. This \nblood type discrimination never needed to happen. Everyone should try their \nbest not to lower anothers self esteem. Conflict is inevitable. There are \ncuts in team sports, and things in which you have to do to gain acceptance \nfrom universities. Its your businesses you've got the right to hire who you \nwant to. You shouldn't make fun of a person who applied to your job if they \ndidn't publicize about it. You should be proud of the genetics that you \nwere blessed with. I don't like who would you rather be questions. If you \nwant to be a certain way make yourself that way through life. Everyone is \nimprisoned by the mass population. Mass is not weight. Mass is the amount \nof matter in an object or person. Density = Mass/Volume. I don't get mass \nits the amount of matter in a object or person. Is muscle of more matter \nthan fat. Muscle is more dense than fat. According to the mohs scale of \nhardness there is no direct correlation between density and hardness. \nCorundum has a density of 2.61 cubic centimeters and it can float on water. \nCorundum is the second hardest known thing next to diamond. The only way \nyou can scratch a diamond is by using another diamond. Things are complex \nthese days. People don't have a respect for other peoples rights, they are \nnoisey, they have attitude problems. Building friendship is apart of life. \nLife always was and still will continue to be unfair. You've got to get use \nto it. The things in which society forces people to do must be fair. \nPaleontologists believe that raptors hunted in packs. Paleontologist \nbelieve Raptor Packs had hierarchical structure. Based off raptors hunting \nin packs, building friendship is apart of life, life is unfair get use to \nit.  There was a known Alpha Raptor. I question whether dinosaurs existed \nor not. \ufeff",

These antibody's -and the 'memory' against \nRhesus-D your mother would have made, could attack a Rhesus-D positive \nchild in the womb, if she got pregnant again. This could cause the baby \nbeing born with Jaundice also called 'Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn'.\n\nSo in order to prevent your mother from producing anti-D against the \nRhesus-D antigen on your RBC, they gave her anti-D from a donor. And these \nwould help her remove your RBC from her bloodstream without her immune \nsystem 'learning' about the Rhesus-D antigen.",
