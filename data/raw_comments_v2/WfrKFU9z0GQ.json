And many other traffic violations that are quite a big \ncause for accidents. I have never seen or heard of anyone getting a ticket \nnor a warning for the above mentioned violations. But I have heard about \ngetting tickets at places with a road coming out at a bigger road with 100% \nvisibility, but didn't make a small pause at the traffic sign because there \nare no cars/cyclists/pedestrians in sight for at least a hundred meters. \nWhile the police hide behind a little sign somewhere.\n\nBut I think that's a bigger problem with traffic control than actual \ndriving ability. As long as the police don't say anything, even though they \nare waiting at the front at a traffic light, then that must mean that it's \nnot a violation, therefore you may do it. Seems to be the logic.\ufeff",
