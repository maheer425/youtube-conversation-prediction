If the soft drinks industry shows outstanding characteristics \nacross all five forces, then why isn't everybody in that industry? Given a \ncurrent state of an industry, how would it evolve with time? (Similar and \nvery obvious questions arise relating all the other forces in specific \ncontexts). The model doesn't provide real explanations as to what drives \nand relates the forces themselves. It seems to be more a method to classify \nsome observations than a predictive theory and then the hard work, \nsubstantive analyses and strategic insights are actually beyond the reach \nof consideration of the five forces and still has to be done.\ufeff",

That is how I see it. The \nquestions you are asking are very valid, but are questions of decision \nmaking and strategy rather than analysis of business environment. Someone \ncan take into account all of these aforementioned forces, yet still decide \nto enter a market however unfavorable it may seem of a plethora of \ndifferent reasons.

Without \nPorter's research, it may have been more difficult for one to narrow it \ndown to 5 forces versus 100.\n\nIn terms of why it may \"seem\" like he didn't answer the interviewer's \nquestions...a lot of interviews are rehearsed and the interviewers are \nsimply there to support the topic that the interviewee wishes to speak \nabout.
