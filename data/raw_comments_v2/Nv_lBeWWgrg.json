Haiti (Colonized by France) was the richest of \nall colonies, even richer than the US at the time of slavery. They had a \nlot more slaves than the Dominican Republic because their cash crop was \nsugar cane, which was the most demanding(labor intensive) crop but very \nprofitable. More profitable than any other crop including cotton. The \nslaves were worked long and hard, in the worst conditions. Because of that \nthe life span for a slaves, in rich Haiti, was very short compared to \nslaves elsewhere. Believe it or not, but the slave masters there \nintentionally worked their slaves to death(an early death). They felt it \nwas more profitable to work the slaves long and hard, causing them to be \nworked to death, and just continue to replace them.\n\nWhen the slaves rebelled, they won. They kicked Napoleons troops butt. So \nbad that France was almost broke and that's how the US got such a great \ndeal on the Louisiana Purchase. \n\nWith that being said, the country was being run and worked by the very \npeople that knew how & did all the agricultural work(the work that already \nmade Haiti the richest colony). Now of course the European and the US \npowers were not about to allow those Haitians to prosper, and those powers \nespecially the US did everything in their power to sabotage, and their \nreason was(If Haiti prospered it would put the US in a higher possibility \nof having slave revolts). The world forced Haiti to pay reparations to \nFrance (so much reparations that Haiti couldn't afford to pay it all). They \nput sanctions on Haiti which forced the world not to do business with \nHaiti. Not to mention all the millions of dollars Haiti was paying shipping \ncompanies that were supposed to be shipping goods and services from Haiti \nthat was never delivered, the money was stolen and never ever giving back \nto Haiti.\n\nSo what did that cause? It caused mass poverty. The country was \nintentionally ruined. Everybody should know mass poverty leads to \ncorruption, violence, crime,  a break down of society, and no ability to \nhave law in order. Everything I just said is verifiable.       \ufeff",
