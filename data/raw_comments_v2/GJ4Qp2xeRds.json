            "text": "Space elevator, could You hear me laughing? Ok, not, but is this man sure \nthis will be stable? It's not only a fact of mass but also of torsion. If \nYou build up an object which is 21747 miles height then the rotational \nspeed of this thing at bottom is 1700 km/h and at the top: 10800 km/h. That \nis the first problem, the next: in between the tower is  affected by storms \nand air fluctuations so the structure has to be more stable than those \nstorm effects. If You build up a structure of this height then a little \neffect in about 10 km height may destroy the whole structure and then the \nstructure itself will come down or - the outer portion perhaps - will go up \nin space. And then it was the highest thing. The next: Every thing has an \nmaximum lenght as a structure p.Ex. if You build up a wire of a length l \nthen there is a mass which works on one end. And if the mass of the wire \nexceeds the max. strenght force of the matzerial then the material will be \nbroken by its own weight. And for steel this length is (with certain \nsecurity level) at about 6 km. You can use materials like glass as fibre \n(160 km) or sill as fibre (50 km) but don't forget that every material will \nundergo changings by influence of temperature, vibrations and so on. And \nwith the time the material will be less good so You'll have to change them. \nBut how will You cange material in 21700 km height? Or - even worse (in \n11000 km height? A single failure and the whole structure comes down. And \nthe next is: What will You do against fast space objects surrounding the \nearth? Think of my first question (torsion) Does a structure widthstands a \ntorsion by a collison of an object with speed difference of p.Ex. 1000 km/h \nat the top (21700 miles)? I don't think it. So this question of space \nelevator is quite a nice thinking but not real.\ufeff",

I \nvery seriously doubt that the United States ALONE would be responsible for \nthe construction of a space elevator (when that happens), and also worth \nnoting is the fact that we are probably AT LEAST a hundred years away from \nrealistically building something like this.  To apply today's threats to \none hundred years into the future is in itself naive, and it doesn't even \nfit today's politics either.\n\nSecondly, where's the fear?  If they severed it, it's not like it would \ncome crashing down anyway.  It would just fly off into space (the vast \nmajority of it would anyway).  So they would have succeeded in preventing \ngovernments (and well-financed private space programs) from sending \npayloads into orbit.  This would not have any effect whatsoever on the \nabsolute vast majority of the population - - and it would probably cost the \n'terrorists' an unimaginable amount of money to pull off.  I don't think it \nmakes much sense.  Bigger (as in physical size) is not better.  Higher body \ncount is better.  Bigger economic impact is better (better from the \nterrorist's perspective anyway).  Destroying the space elevator will not \nresult in either a high death toll nor would it have much effect on the \neconomy.  You would lose the ability to put payloads into orbit cheaply for \na decade or so.  The average Joe funding the economy via taxes, spending \nand other similar means will not be affected by the absence of the ability \nof his government to send a payload into orbit.\n\nThink about it this way.  If NASA stopped sending astronauts into space, \nare you going to stop buying milk?  No.  It would have no effect on you - - \nand you, and others like you are what drive the economy.\n\nI strongly disagree with your assertion that a space elevator would be a \nviable terrorist target simply because it's really tall.  It's again - - \nextremely naive.",

But I see no way vastly \ndifferent countries would work together (such as America and Arab States.) \nso terrorism works be a factor.\n\nI know that terrorists don't attack because they can. They do it to spread \na message, or to spread fear.

Look at that post again.   I was commenting \non your comments, not some comments on a wiki article. That is all.  \nObviously, in any business, the fuel costs are a tiny percentage of the \namount that business charges for its service.  (Also, you talk about \nsomeones  opinion in their wiki article about a technology in its infancy, \nas if that opinion were somehow gospel.  It is not.  Currently these \nare science fiction dreams)\n    You are still talking about whether or not an astronaut has to pay \nsomething to go to the ISS. That is meaningless to the discussion (no he \ndoesn't pay anything, he gets a huge salary to go there.  I and we, pay for \nhim and the equipment to go there!).  You say $100 for energy to climb to \norbit.  After the thing is built, there will be staggering costs to operate \nit.   So you have $40 bil to build it, and huge costs to operate it, each \nof those items of which will be multiples times the fuel , but here you are \ntalking about fuel as if it is some major part of the enterprise. Just the \ncost of the huge surface  ship, and the people operating that ship, and the \nfuel required for that ship will dwarf the costs of energy to operate the \nelevator. Also, have you ever noticed that a budget for a govt project, \nALWAYS overruns by 100 to 200%.  But enough of that! On to other subjects!  \nYou seem to imply that to put an object into orbit, the only costs to get \nit there will be the space elevator.  You do realize, I hope, that if you \navail yourself of a spacesuit, go on this ride, and desire to take a \nspacewalk, the only place you can take that spacewalk is at or near to \n22,200 miles up.   In other words, to put objects into orbit at any other \naltitude will require a spaceship, personnel, and fuel.  I.e.,  huge costs \nbeyond the costs of raising the object to 22,200 miles.  (I am certain that \nyou realize that to put an object into orbit 250 miles up, you cant just \ntake your elevator up to 250 miles up and dump it out -- it also needs a \nlateral speed of 17,000mph. more costs).  And speaking of that 17,000 mph, \nthere are at least 10,000 articles up there going that speed.  What happens \nwhen one of them hits that tether?  Mighty unlikely I realize, but unlikely \nthings do happen every day.   I realize that many questions can be asked \nabout any technology that has been, and will be, but I think it is safe to \nsay that rather then this we are going to find advancements of spaceplanes, \nand drives,  as methods to go into space.  I also realize that 60 years \nago, people couldn't even imagine the technology present today, so I must \nadmit that the future will be amazing.",

And even if he could, I'm not talking \nabout what he is CHARGED to ride the elevator. I (and those that came up \nwith the $100 figure) are talking about what it COSTS.

When you are CHARGED $100 for a plane ticket, the COST of \nflying your ignorant ass is a lot less than that - otherwise, I doubt the \nairline would stay in business. You smell what I'm cooking?!

There is a cost/person -- there is \nnothing for free on this world.  (That statement really was na\u00efve).   You \nsaying that the cost/ride to 22k miles is $100/lb, just because the energy \nmight cost that,  is hilarious -- when did the cost of a plane ticket ever \nbecome just  the cost of the fuel?\n   20 to 40 billion!!!  Do you even at all begin to understand what such a \nproject would involve?   Finally, I might ask, what is that elevator going \nto actually be used for?  To haul tourists up and down?  I guess you could \nuse it to haul parts for spaceships up to 22,200 miles, and assemble the \nship there, etc, etc.\n    It is a very exciting project, but I seriously doubt that it will cost \nonly $100/lb to take that trip. Again, BNSF says that their trains can \ntransport 1 ton of cargo, five hundred miles, using 1 gallon of diesel.  \nUsing your logic, that ton should cost you  $3 to ship 500 miles, or you \nshould be able to ride that 500 miles for about 30 cents.  Sound silly?  \nYes it does.\n    So I guess, if in your life you see this project happen, see if it \ncosts 20 to 40 billion in todays dollars, for the whole project,  and see \nwhether you can get that 22,200 mile ride for 17,000 dollars in todays \ndollars.

It's not a \ndifferent day. It would be the same as watching a sunset, then driving west \nreally fast.All you are doing is changing your viewing position, on the \nsame day. \nAnd changing the fasting times for people at the top of the tower doesn't \ncount, because if they started fasting when the sun rose at the top of the \ntower, then their fasting time would be approximately 6 minutes longer, \nthan those at the bottom. The obverse concept would be if you lived in a \nwell, your (viewed) sunrise and sunset would only be a few minutes apart, \nbut that's not the actual sunrise and sunset times.\nIt does not \"cost\" $11,000 to send a pound of material into orbit, that is \nonly what NASA charges to do it. You can get a pound of anything into orbit \nfor thousands and thousands less than that.\ufeff",
