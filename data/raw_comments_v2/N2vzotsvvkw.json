In fact, ORNL's actual original research is serving as the \nfoundation which underlies China's current \"skunk works\" project to bring \nLiFTR's to utility scale (1000MwE) deployment by 2024.  What we know about \nrenewables, among other things, is that their environmental impacts (both \nfrom manufacturing and deployment) are far from benign - more importantly, \ntheir intermittency makes them unreliable and they simply cannot be scaled \nup fast enough to meet the growing energy demands of humankind.  Yes, there \nare engineering obstacles to be overcome with LiFTR's, but from where I sit \nit seems way more than worthwhile to get the engineering issues solved.  \nThere are no large scale thorium reactors today because Hyman Rickover (et \nal) made a decision years ago to adopt solid Uranium fueled LWR \ntechnology to power the nuclear U.S. navy.  Why?  Plutonium for America's \nnuclear arsenal - something that LiFTRs cannot provide.

I'm a physics undergraduate student at UCONN, and even though \nI'm an aspiring astrophysicist, energy use and consumption is an extremely \nimportant topic to me. \n\nI haven't read all the discussions here, but I've read a few. I virtually \nalways support solar energy, and it is my second favorite kind. \nI am here to discuss my first, however, which I seriously doubt has been \ntalked about.\n\nIt is a type of nuclear energy, and before you skip over this, it has \nnothing to do with heavy water, or even uranium. It is an overlooked \nnuclear energy type that was forgotten in the atom era due to it's \ninability to make a by-product that could be manufactured into a bomb. \n\nI'm talking of Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors. It is a liquid-salt type \nof reactor, using Thorium, something found in virtually everyones dirt in \ntheir backyard, as the reactant. \n\nIt's extremely safe, so much so that one of only two-types of liquid-salt \nreactors ever tested in America was put into an aircraft, and would \nnaturally condense or expand to provided the needed energy as the pilot \nthrottled down or up, respectively. \n\nThorium is so cheap and unused that many mines through it out. This would \nmake initial costs a little expensive, as no mining company expects an \norder of thorium, but long term, it is literally cheap as dirt.\n\nAs in the +TED talk below, by Kirk Sorensen, this is easily the safest kind \nof nuclear power, requiring no flowing water or emergency plan if power is \ncut-off, and producing very little radioactive waste (the waste that is \nproduced also has a significantly smaller half-life time as those produced \nfrom current nuclear power methods). \n\nI strongly support and encourage everyone investigate Thorium reactors. The \nvideo below is the best place to start learning about it, and gives a \nsuperbly accurate overview of the benefits of a Liquid Fluoride Thorium \nReactor (LFTR).\n\nThank you for your time.\ufeff",

            "text": "None of the reasons given here make much sense:\n\n- I won't dwell on the you can't make nuclear weapons from thorium \nargument, it's one of the most enduring myths of nuclear power. While it is \ntrue that uranium fueled reactors were chosen over thorium ones for that \nreason, it simply doesn't account for the fact that over 6 decades after, \nthorium still isn't used. Nuclear nations don't need a civilian nuclear \npower industry to create plutonium.\n\n- The arguments about the technology being suppressed by evil energy \nmultinationals is even more laughable! They simply don't have the power to \ndo that. The only thing they can do is lobby the government against \nsubsidising the technology. But if it is as cheap as they claim, why on \nEarth would they need subsidies? That argument just makes no sense!\n\n- The argument regarding the costs of the fuel is simply untrue. It doesn't \nmatter how much uranium costs compared to thorium, the cost of nuclear \nenergy, be it uranium or thorium fueled is research, fuel processing, \nconstruction, safety, waste management, decommission costs etc... The cost \nof the natural resource, unlike oil and gas, is tiny compared to the \noverall cost.\n\n- As for oil and gas companies not funding the technology, well what can I \nsay about that! Why would they fund a technology that would rival their \nproduct and in which they have no expertise? And it doesn't explain why \nfunding hasn't come from elsewhere. Oil and gas companies are not the only \npeople with money. Oh and the fact that oil companies don't invest in new \ntechnology is also false. They have become big players in the renewable \nenergy space such as the solar industry. No wonder, solar does not directly \ncompete with oil.\n\n\nSo what's the catch? There isn't one. This technology has never been proven \nto work on a large scale. You never know if something is scalable until you \nactually do it. And the costs of production are going to be multiple times \nwhat they advertise, I guarantee that. It's the case for every technology.\n\nThe reality is that, investors would go to Pluto if they knew they could \nmake some money there! If few of them have turned up, it's probably because \nthey're unsure about the returns. If the technology was the beginning of a \nreal revolution, these investors would have materialised already.\n\nNuclear energy is cheap but it requires a large upfront investment. You \nrecoup your money over time. So the first units of energy you produce are \nthe most expensive so to speak and you only see the good times once the \nindustry is mature. Investors favour quick returns, no one wants to see \nresults in 20 or 30 years time which is about the amount of time it will \ntake for thorium to establish itself... if the technology does not \nexperience problems when deployed on a large scale.\n\nThere is no big conspiracy, simply a promising technology that is evolving \nat the pace technologies normally evolve, which is very slowly.",

We see this as a great thing now, but back in the \n50's when we first did research on this and the water-uranium based systems \nwe use now, we found that only the uranium's by-products could be used for \nbombs. So we picked that. Few heard of LFTR's, or liquid-salts in general, \nand it's knowledge didn't really spread at all. Now we're in an era the \nswitch would have a huge initial sunk cost as no one buys thorium, so the \nprices are high, even though it's abundant, and its very much different \nthan uranium reacts, so we couldn't use the same works or experts, we'd \nneed to re-train everyone. Those are the major reasons. Not enough people \nknow about it to get funding; there's a huge publicity view against nuclear \npower, sadly; oil and gas companies don't want to lose their monopoly \neither, hence why they don't really invest in new technologies very much.",
