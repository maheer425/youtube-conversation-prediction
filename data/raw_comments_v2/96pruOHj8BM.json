If this dude is not a butt fucking \n,cocking sucking fagot I don't know what is.The lion is an animal that \nknows no better.No wonder these male big cats are docile,they have the \n\"Richard Simmons of big cat trainers\" taking care of them ! LOL ! That dude \nis probably jerking the cats off making them  sexually satisfied. I'll bet \nmy house that's why his Lions are gentle and seems to have a grin on their \nfaces.\ufeff",
