There have \nbeen many times when we neglected to react until the enemy was on our door \nstep, such as Pearl Harbor. But more notably was the rise of the GOLDEN \nHORDE. Also know as the Mongols. Yes, the Mongols were a far east problem \nthat we didn't care about. Sure, they were expanding west, and we knew the \nsorts of atrocities they committed. But that was happening in the Middle \nEast, so we didn't care. But suddenly they were at the borders of the Holy \nRoman Empire. It wasn't German might that turned them away. It was chance \nthat the Great Khan died and the other Khans had to return home.\n\nWe keep telling ourselves not to get involved but then we always end up \nwith a crisis as their attention eventually turns to us.\ufeff",

One can easily use Islamic \ntexts (Koran+Hadith+Sira) to justify a desire for \"justice\" using violence, \nespecially since such violence has already been used by Muhammad, the \nprophet of Islam, and his acolytes to resolve their conflict with the \npagans of Kuraish, and later to spread Islam in nearby regions of the \nMiddle East and North Africa, and to fight against the apostates (who grew \nin number after Muhammad passed away - some suggest he was poisoned).\n\nIf nowadays Muslim extremists were Jain extremists for instance, they would \nhave no way whatsoever to justify any act of violence using their religious \ntexts, and they would easily be ostracized from their communities if they \nresorted to it. But they're not, because they're still considered as \nMuslims, and in some cases as heroes. It may be true that most Muslims are \nnot violent, but no recognized Islamic institution so far has issued a \nsingle fatwa excommunicating terrorists. And terrorism is not the only \nproblem. It's just the visible tip of the iceberg. Most Muslims from my \nexperience, especially those living in majority Muslim countries, are \nagainst secularism and totally for the establishment of a theocratic state \nwhere some form of Sharia would be applied. They may not agree with the \nmeans, but they have similar objectives to Islamic terrorists.\ufeff",
