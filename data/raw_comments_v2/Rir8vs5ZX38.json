Lynch \n\nSome nights I go out and piss on the front lawn \nas a form of freedom\u2014liberty from \nporcelain and plumbing and the Great Beyond \nbeyond the toilet and the sewage works. \nHere is the statement I am trying to make: \nto say I am from a fierce bloodline of men \nwho made their water in the old way, under stars \nthat overarched the North Atlantic where \nthe River Shannon empties into sea. \nThe ex-wife used to say, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you pee \nin concert with the most of humankind \nwho do their business tidily indoors?\u201d \nIt was gentility or envy, I suppose, \nbecause I could do it anywhere, and do \nwhenever I begin to feel encumbered. \nStill, there is nothing, here in the suburbs, \nas dense as the darkness in West Clare \nnor any equivalent to the nightlong wind \nthat rattles in the hedgerow of whitethorn there \non the east side of the cottage yard in Moveen. \nIt was market day in Kilrush, years ago: \nmy great-great-grandfather bargained with tinkers \nwho claimed it was whitethorn that Christ\u2019s crown was made from. \nSo he gave them two and six and brought them home\u2014 \nmere saplings then\u2014as a gift for the missus, \nwho planted them between the house and garden. \nFor years now, men have slipped out the back door \nduring wakes or wedding feasts or nights of song \nto pay their homage to the holy trees \nand, looking up into that vast firmament, \nconsider liberty in that last townland where \nthey have no crowns, no crappers and no ex-wives.\ufeff",
