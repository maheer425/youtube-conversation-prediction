Whether you learn \nvia institution or outside of scholastic setting you gain new knowledge. \nYou may find something that sparks your curiosity and then capitalize on \nit. For instance, you may find that you've always had a subtle interest \nancient architecture, but prior to hearing Tai Lopez speak you always \nfigured it wasn't worth the read and let it fall to the wayside. Following \nhis Tedx speech it may change the way you feel about taking that time to \nread about that ancient architecture. After reading you might decide to \nvisit that famous piece of architecture...Meet someone who also is just as \nenthusiastic about that architecture.... Hit it off... Find out he's a \nsuccessful such and such...you begin working with he or she...become \nsuccessful...etc...Because you have watched this video you create a \nself-fulfilling prophecy. When you go to read, something peaks your \ninterest because you expect something to and you assume Tai Lopez is the \nmost inspirational, brilliant, and accurate speaker ever. Though many of \nthe ideas he conveys aren't illogical, they aren't exactly saying \nanything.... He's being vague. The only way to get anywhere is to DO \nsomething to get there. Yeah, I guess you could say because of what Tai \nsaid whoever had that slight interest in architecture worked up the courage \nbecause of this video to read about that architecture and then go to visit \nthat piece of architecture, perhaps a gothic cathedral, then they happened \nto meet someone who was successful etc. \n\nThe point is Tai didn't say anything other than read and be around people. \nThat's common sense, in order to be successful you have to do something and \nput yourself out there.\ufeff",

Screw looks and friends. You are what you are. Get real and it \nwill happen. Only God can save you. I started playing with bands in 1967. \nEnded up drunk, drugs, screwing skanks,,Down to nothing..Stock broker \nlosing $178,000 per year. Pretty sick life. I ended up laying flat on my \nface BEGGING GOD for His mersey. By 2002 I was making $54,000 per month and \nplaying guitar again. But not so stupid. Girl screw what others think! Get \nright with God and only respect the person you see in the mirror!!!!!! Stop \nlooking to others (I need) for your success. You have your self, luck, \nskill and a total trust in God,It works..Do what the successful people do.\ufeff",

If \nonly you would take your time to actually listen to what he says. Not just \nhear what HEAR what he says but actually LISTEN to him two very different \nthings. Most of you are criticize him because you couldn't get anything out \nof it. The point he making is that by reading books you get more \nintelligent, you broaden your horizons and try to get as much out of them \nas possible. This way if you do plan to start a business or anything in \nthat field you have different methods, ideas, blueprints etc. Don't accuse \nthe people who listen to him as being naive. Maybe we're just not arrogant \npeople who think we don't need a little advice, were not people who pretend \nto be perfect and we don't need to take absolutely anything from what he \nsays. Maybe just maybe we're not closed minded bigots who won't even give \nthis guy a chance.
