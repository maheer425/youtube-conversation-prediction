However as much as I like the movie it has \nsome pretty twisted messages and stories. Rick Grimes may be a bad ass in \nthe walking Dead but here he's a little bit of a douche and more like Sean \nin the Walking Dead moving in on his best friends wife. Also the prime \nministers brother in law (Alan Rickman) dangerously considers cheating on \nhis wife and get caught I say dangerously because who knows what the prime \nminister could do to you for breaking his sisters heart. Collin Firth is \nnot immune to the cheater bugs in this movie as he finds his wife cheating \non him with his brother, although through that infidelity he did luck out \nand find his Portuguese girlfriend. Anyway lots of cheating going on during \nthe holidays in the UK apparently. Oh and one more thing what's up with \nputting the U.S. President as a major dick and having the U.S./UK \nrelationship as a bully. We're allies for goodness sakes. Still a good \nmovie \ufeff",

He damn sure knows why his feelings will \nnever be returned and really doesn't try to ensure they will. And if \nanything the kiss was more of a pity thing than a romantic gesture.
