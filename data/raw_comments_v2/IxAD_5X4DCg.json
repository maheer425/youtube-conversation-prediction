At \nthe doctors they said i was lucky. A centimeter to the left and it would of \nhit my pupil and i would of been permanently blind and that i had blood \nswishing in my eye. I had to sleep with my head elevated for the week so \nthe blood wouldn't settle in the back of my eye and dry up. Now days the \nonly permanent effect is that a small microscopic part of my eye is \nmissing. It's not major and i don't have to worry about it. Now you guys \nmust be wondering how i got shot. I got shot while my step brother was \nchecking out an air soft pistol and he didn't know it was loaded. He fired \nthe gun and the bb was launched which eventually ricocheted off the wall \nand landed in my eye. It was in the house and there was no air soft fight. \nIt was just a lesson to be learned for him.

Even if \nthat weren't true, it wouldn't only be upside down, but backwards.\n\nOur eyes use layers of lens like tissue to focus light into a specific \npoint on the retina. These \"lenses\" move to match the orientation of the \npupil, which is why you don't need to move your head to focus on something.\nEvery stream of photons is organized and sent nearly parallel to the \norientation of your pupil, but not quite, as they all most congregate in a \nsmall area along the front of your retina. Each strand of photons is very \nbroad at first, but your eye is able to sort them into a straight line more \nor less, preventing any stray light from getting to your retina.\n\nMuscles can \"squeeze\" this lens of yours in order to focus on objects that \nare father away. This is because it bends outwards slightly, like a dome. \nThe light entering the front of the dome doesn't need to be ordered as \nmuch, therefore is more narrow and fine, which means it is what we are \nfocusing on. In fact, the reason why your peripheral vision is so blurry is \nbecause light strands need to be re-oriented harder in order to not create \nchaos. It unfortunately also means that the ending strand is wider, which \nmeans blurrier.\n\n\nOur eyes see right side up, but still works just as hard.\n\n\n#24 Also untrue. We have 3 cone cells, one for Red, one for Blue, and a \nlast for Green.\n\n\n#19 I'd believe this can be true, but there are not 100,000,000 colors. In \nfact, the only things this mutation adds is a yellow-sensitive cone cell.\ufeff",
