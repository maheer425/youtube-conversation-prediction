I find that the better the place, the \nmore mandatory tipping seems. I almost never see any tipping in coffee \nplaces like Starbucks or fast food restaurants, but if you are constantly \ntaken care by a rushing waiter, who treats you well and with a smile, 99% \nof customers will leave some tip.\nIn Spain where I used to live, I can say for sure that tipping is NOT \ncommon at all. I was shocked to see that after hours of sitting at a bar \ntable, treating themselves to plenty of drinks and snacks, my friends would \npick up every little bit of their change and leave absolutely nothing for \nthe waiter. We discussed this and as it was said in the interview, Spanish \npeople don't see the point in paying more for a service that's already \noverpriced (have in mind that waiters get at least the minimum wage, \nusually a little bit more - around 1000 euros per month, health insurance \nincluded, so the society doesn't feel obligated to help out).\nWhen I worked as a waitress myself for one summer in a Scandinavian bar, I \nhad two types of customers: those who tipped immensely (from 20 to more \neuros per order), and those who tipped with cents which is truly petty and \nI would have preferred no tip at all. This is the only time I experienced \nthis sort of strange tipping traditions.\n\nIn general, tipping in all European countries has a sense of generosity. \nYou feel like tipping a waiter who has welcomed you with a smile and with \nwhom you've connected (chatted a bit and so on). This is one of the reasons \nwhy workers in other areas of service are rarely tipped - if you don't \nengage with them as much, the tip doesn't come to mind. It is first and \nforemost an expression of generosity and sympathy.",

It's up to customer really. But it is \npolite to tip. I was a waitress in different types of ...buisness \n(restaurant, hotel, pizzeria) and I mostly got a good tipping :) In some \nplaces, the tip is for a waitress and in some places it's then devided \nbetween waiters and cooks who worked that day. But the tipping here occurs \nin other buisness as well. Now I work in a doggy daycare and I'm getting \ntips when people are satisfied (and not arrogant) ;)\n\nSo yeah, that's it. Hope that help to have a closer look :) Have a nice day.",
