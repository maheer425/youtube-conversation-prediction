However, in \nSchindler's List, symbols such as the girl in the red coat were used \nbecause they obviously did not have accurate or detailed information to \npass on, so they added things like this for the drama. Also, Amon Goeth was \nmuch worse in real life than he was in Schindler's List, so Speilberg had \nto tone him down because his actions were too violent to show on film. \nSchindler's List also simply can not be an accurate representation of the \nHolocaust. No movie can. The film is \"far from reality\" because it shows \nthe lives of thousands being killed, while in reality, millions were \nkilled.

I already commented on \nyour other one, but I'll tell you again: (1). Schindler's List isn't \nsupposed to be a documentary/docudrama, it's considered a historical \nfiction, and it's people's fault that they think it's supposed to be a \ndocumentary (2) Things like the ghetto liquidation did in fact happen, it's \njust that Speilberg and Keneally didn't have exact info about when \nSchindler was on the hill. Real historical info did not match what Keneally \nwrote in his novel, and why should it? It's historical fiction. However, \nSchindler did absolutely witness the liquidation of the ghetto. (3) Amon \nGoeth was much more ruthless and violent in real life than compared to the \nfilm/novel, so they toned him down. (4).

The footage & photos of the supposed 'gas chamber' at Dachau \nturned out to be a small fumigation chamber for inmate clothing. And the \nmountains of dead bodies were typhus victims. Hundreds of bodies were \nexamined & autopsied by medical doctors & not one was ever found that died \nby gassing. Zyklon-B was used by the ton to fumigate the inmates clothing & \nbedding to kill lice & prevent typhus epidemics & SAVE INMATE LIVES. So \nempty cans of it doesn't prove genocide. Herman Goering denied the \nholocaust at Nuremberg & did not cooperate with the prosecution at all. And \nthe lying Jews can build holocrock museums in every city on earth, & it \nstill doesn't prove their false allegations There are  scores of Holocaust \nRevisionist books available now, that destroy the myth from EVERY angle. \nI've read 20 of them now, some written by Jews. How many have YOU read, \ngenius?",

The IRC (Red Cross) inspected all the \ncamps on a regular basis, found no genocidal program, & their postwar \nreport states that 271,308 inmates in the camps from ALL nationalities \nperished, mostly from Typhus.

Die \nNazis hatten sie 1943 zerst\u00f6rt.\n\nPolnische und israelische Arch\u00e4ologen haben nach jahrelanger \nForschungsarbeit die \u00dcberreste der Gaskammern des deutschen \nVernichtungslagers Sobib\u00f3r entdeckt. Tomasz Kranz, Direktor der \nGedenkst\u00e4tte Majdanek, sprach in einer Mitteilung von einer \"historischen \nEntdeckung\". Der israelische Arch\u00e4ologe Yoram Haimi sagte: \"Nach acht \nJahren sind wir endlich am Ziel.\"\nEs sei eine \"sehr wichtige Entdeckung\" f\u00fcr die Holocaustforschung, sagte \nder Historiker David Silberklang von der israelischen Gedenkst\u00e4tte Yad \nVashem. \"Diese Funde sind alles, was von denen \u00fcbrig blieb, die dort \nermordet wurden. Wir werden genauer wissen, wie der Mord in dem Lager vor \nsich ging und was die Juden durchmachten, ehe sie ermordet wurden.\" \nAusgrabungen der Ruinen der Gaskammern w\u00fcrden auch helfen, genauere Angaben \n\u00fcber die Zahl der Ermordeten und die Kapazit\u00e4t der Gaskammern zu machen.\n\nSeit 2007 hat ein internationales Team an der Lagerst\u00e4tte im S\u00fcdosten \nPolens gegraben. Dabei fanden die Arch\u00e4ologen zahlreiche Gegenst\u00e4nde, die \neinst den Ermordeten geh\u00f6rt haben m\u00fcssen. Unter den Fundst\u00fccken fanden sich \netwa Schmuck, Parf\u00fcm und Medikamente, berichtet die Jerusalem Post.\nSobib\u00f3r \u00fcberlebte kaum einer\nAnders als etwa Auschwitz-Birkenau war Sobib\u00f3r ein reines Vernichtungslager \nohne M\u00f6glichkeit f\u00fcr die H\u00e4ftlinge, als Zwangsarbeiter vielleicht eine \n\u00dcberlebenschance zu haben. Zwischen April 1942 und Herbst 1943 wurden dort \nmindestens 250.000 Menschen ermordet.\nVereinzelt gab es Fluchtversuche, wegen derer im Juni 1943 ein Mineng\u00fcrtel \num das Lager gelegt wurde. Am 14. Oktober 1943 schlie\u00dflich kam es zu einem \nAufstand der H\u00e4ftlinge. 600 j\u00fcdische Gefangene setzten sich der SS zur \nWehr. Zwischen 100 und 120 Menschen \u00fcberlebten die Revolte, 60 gar den \nKrieg. Es war der zweite, zum Teil erfolgreiche Aufstand von Gefangenen in \neinem Vernichtungslager nach dem Aufstand von Treblinka.\nDie SS nutzte das Lager im Anschluss nicht weiter. Noch im selben Jahr \nzerst\u00f6rten es die Nazis, um die Spuren ihrer Verbrechen zu verwischen. Erst \nebneten sie das Gel\u00e4nde, dann bauten sie einen Bauernhof darauf und \npflanzten B\u00e4ume.\"",
