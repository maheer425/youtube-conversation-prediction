He invented all his gadgets. Maybe not in the \ncurrent films, but in every other circumstance. Nolan's goal was to make \nhis universe more realistic, which is the reasoning. He probably has more \nlayers than any other hero, with his extreme PTSD, being the reason for his \ndark, brooding rage and depression which he takes out as he puts on the \nbat-cowl.
