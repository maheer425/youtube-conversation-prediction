Tragedies \ncause many people to question God\u2019s goodness. It is distressing that \nnatural disasters are often termed \u201cacts of God\u201d while no \u201ccredit\u201d is given \nto God for years, decades, or even centuries of peaceful weather. God \ncreated the whole universe and the laws of nature. Most natural disasters \nare a result of these laws at work. Hurricanes, typhoons, and tornados are \nthe results of divergent weather patterns colliding. Earthquakes are the \nresult of the earth\u2019s plate structure shifting. A tsunami is caused by an \nunderwater earthquake.\n\n\nThe Bible proclaims that Jesus Christ holds all of nature together \n(Colossians 1:16-17). Could God prevent natural disasters? Absolutely! Does \nGod sometimes influence the weather? Yes, as we see in Deuteronomy 11:17 \nand James 5:17. Numbers 16:30-34 shows us that God sometimes causes natural \ndisasters as a judgment against sin. The book of Revelation describes many \nevents which could definitely be described as natural disasters (Revelation \nchapters 6, 8, and 16). Is every natural disaster a punishment from God? \nAbsolutely not.\n\nIn much the same way that God allows evil people to commit evil acts, God \nallows the earth to reflect the consequences sin has had on creation. \nRomans 8:19-21 tells us, \u201cThe creation waits in eager expectation for the \nsons of God to be revealed. For the creation was subjected to frustration, \nnot by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope \nthat the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and \nbrought into the glorious freedom of the children of God.\u201d The fall of \nhumanity into sin had effects on everything, including the world we \ninhabit. Everything in creation is subject to \u201cfrustration\u201d and \u201cdecay.\u201d \nSin is the ultimate cause of natural disasters just as it is the cause of \ndeath, disease, and suffering.",

If it is extreme, people \noften interpret this as being in-love, but often it doesn't have oxytocin \nand vasopressin levels required to be called in-love.\n\nIn-love: Looking into each others eyes, often having a us against the world \nideals and feelings. Can last 6 months to 3 years.Given that this stage \ndoesn't allow you to see faults very well in the other, it can be difficult \nif when one falls out of love, suddenly reality comes crashing down. This \nalso explains why one night stands or casual relationships are not for \neveryone as some people have a quicker ability to fall in love, \nparticularly during orgasm or other intimate relations with the person. \n(And yes, this explains why your friend might be boyfriend/girlfriend or \neven married to someone who clearly is not a good influence, being in-love \nis pretty blind for many people.)\n\nLong-term love: Looking in the same direction, facing things and growing \ntogether. This stage is one many relationships do not reach. It's that one \nwhere you see the person clearly angry with the other, yet still holding \nthe umbrella in the rain for the person while getting drenched themselves.\ufeff",
