Both are wise men but still put the fate of the entire world into the \nhands of 2-3 little people because well shit what else you gonna do.\n3. Both are still capable of feats of magic without the use of their \nprimary tools, Dumbledore can summon Eagles with a moth and Dumbledore can \nset shit on fire with his mind.\n4. One of them was gay while the other was played by a gay actor.\n5. Both have bitching beards.\n6. Both were major characters in 6 movies.\n7. Both form deep friendships with the primary protagonists of the stories.\n8. Both were in an ERB where Dumbledore totally one and I'll fight you on \nthis.\n9.
