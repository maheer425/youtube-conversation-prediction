            "text": "+dedeme Like he says it's hard to define what a nation is. broadly \nspeaking, nation is people who unite with each other on the grounds of \nshared aspects, this can be language, culture, religion, ideals etc etc. \nHowever as you might know whatever you unite under, some people will be \nexcluded from that group. Check your neighborhood, there's a big chance you \nknow someone who doesn't share the same mother tongue, culture, religion as \nyou. This is normal, immigration, exchange of goods and thoughts,etc is of \nall ages. What Green is against, is people who mythologises the unity. \nThese people deny that there ever really was immigration, exchange etc etc. \nto them, what was new wasn't the people uniting and creating an identity \nfor themselves. What was new, was the realisation of people not belonging \nto the created identity. These people thus actually changed reality around. \nOthers have always been there, the newness is people uniting and creating \nan identity. Now you might ask how is this possible? And the folowing is \nperhaps the most interesting thing about nationalism and how it can lead to \nboth great and terrible things. \n\nBy creating an identy for yourself, you also will realise that some people \nare very different from you yourself. by defining yourself, you define \nothers. Likewise for the nation, when the nation creates their identity \nthey define who they are but simultaneously they also decide what they are \nnot. Now if you combine this new sudden realisation, namely of the \nexistence of living together with others, and people who come up with some \nbullshit mythologised history such as the land has always belong to us \nthe... (insert name of newly created identity) ethnic minorities who have \nlived in the same lands as you for centuries are suddenly viewed as \nstrangers. As people less pure and with less rights to the land. \n\nthus, because the nation created an identity for themselves which is at max \n200ish year old. People who lived there together with you way before you \ncreated your identity, get treated as strangers. In the worst cases, they \nget slaughtered or in the'best' ,if you can call it best..,are treated as \nsecond rate citizens who live with daily restrictions for instance a \nrestricted amount of access to higher education. Or higher taxes, or not \ngetting benefits that 'originals natives of the land 'deserve'. This is the \nabsolute worst nationalism. as Green has shown though it doesn't have to go \nthat way. Sad part is 99% of people who call themselves nationalists today \nfollow this definition. The nationalism that makes people build schools and \nhospitals is mostly extinct, because well not a lot of nation states are \ncolonies anymore.Therefore the unifying of a the nation against a foreign \npower is virtually impossible. instead nationalists today look inward, \nconcentrating on ehtnicities and bullying minorities because they aren't \nchildren of the soil. \n\nBasically if you live in a recognized state and a party calls themselves \nnationalist, that party 100% follows the bad interpretation. Only if you \nlive in regions like Palestine, Taiwan, Northern Cyprus, South Ossetia, etc \nall of which are not considered to be actual states and a party calls \nitself nationalistic, there's a chance of it being not shit. Only a chance \nthough...\n\nWell that was a long text, sorry for that hope it cleared things up though.",
