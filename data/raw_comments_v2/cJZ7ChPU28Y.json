She and I are chingu (same aged friends). However we share a \nmutual friend who's born in March 1994 and she'd have to call us eonni even \nwhen her birthday passed and she's in western terms the same age.Age works \na lot differently in Korea. When I first started learning Korean I met this \nKorean guy and he told me he was 21, just like me, and I was like \"that's \ncool, we're chingu!\" but later I found out he was the same age as my \nyounger brother XD He was born in 1995. In Korea you are 1 year old \nimmediately when you get born. Then, even though everyone has a birthday, \neveryone ages one year on new year's day.

For example (using \nwhatever that was shown in the video):\n\nSeonbae = Senpai\nHubae = Kouhai\nEonni & noona can be like nee-san while hyeong & oppa can be like nii-san \nbut with the fact that the person being addressed is not related to you by \nblood.\n\nSo I have a few questions.\n\n1. How would the senior address the junior if they're close together? Or is \nthere like no form for that all? The only thing I came across would be \ndongsaeng which is gender neutral. However, it's not like... Let's use an \nexample. Let's say JiYong-oppa to DaeSung-oppa (yes, they're both older \nthan me). It's not like JiYong-oppa is gonna address DaeSung-oppa as \n\"DaeSung-dongsaeng\". So yeah, that was my question.\n\n2. How would two people who are of the same age but within a few months \ndifference address each other when they're close? Do they still go with the \nbasic honorifics like in the video or do they have a specific way of it or \nthere's none at all? Let's take another example. JiYong-oppa and \nYeongBae-oppa are the same age but the latter is a few months older. Since \nthey're close together, how would YeongBae-oppa address JiYong-oppa in a \ncasual but close manner?\ufeff",
