We can try to battle sin outwardly as much \nas we want, and establish some social reform or temporal change. But does \nthat justify us before God? Without the internal cleansing of our hearts by \nGods Spirit there will be no change in the root of all evil, namely our own \nhearts. Isaiah prophesied the coming of a Savior who would carry our \nsorrows and suffer for our transgresssions (Isaiah 53) Isaiah 7:14 \nTherefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall \nconceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.\nAll prophecy was fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who was born \nfrom the virgin Mary as predicted. He was Holy and Righteous, very God of \nvery God. Carried our sins on the cross so that we would be justified \nbefore God, and conquered death so we might have eternal life. When we put \nour faith in Jesus Christ, that is when we are saved from our sin and by \ngrace reconciled with God. A life with Jesus Christ is a truly reformed \nlife that will bring eternal change, not just temporal. A life in which we \nare free from the burden of sin and cloaked with the Righteousness of \nChrist. Isn't reconciliation with God much more valuable than any Civil \nRight or Social Reform? Isn't Jesus Christ, the Son of God the One we \nshould not be silent about but with all our might \"Let our voices serve as \na shrill blast of the shofar to awaken our nation\"?\ufeff",
