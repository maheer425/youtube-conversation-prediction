Just like falling in love with someone, people \ndon't realized it until something that makes them realizes, correct? It \nwasn't random nor she thought of herself. The thing is that you don't \nunderstand or believe that people can fall OUT of love. \nI used to have your mentality that people shouldn't date another without \nloving them first or making love with someone that they don't love. \nHowever, my mentally changed because people learn news things about the \nperson they like/love with time. \n- - - For example, let's say that you love this guy and he feels the same, \nbut over time being together, you realize little things that bothers the \nheck out of you, or that his personality changes and such or vise-versa. \nThat is when people start to fall out of love. Would you rather have a \nboyfriend that will respect you and tell you that he no longer feels the \nsame about you or date you because of pity? Or date you while dating other \ngirls? \n\n\n*Ps. Hun, people fall out of love and you have to be understand of this.* \nPss. Personally, I think she did the right thing by breaking it off. It \nshows that she respect her ex because she chose not to cheat on her ex \nbehind his back or two timed their relationship.",

In Simons video he said they all hung out and he actually \nsupported their relationship for a while, then upon forming a bond with \nSimon and connecting with him as just friends for a year realized she \nactually had a connection that was more than what she had with her \nboyfriend, so out of respect for him before anything began with Simon she \nended the relationship with the boyfriend. Obviously they weren't serious \nor Simon wouldn't be her Husband what 6,7 years later?

Insulting someone with your biased opinions then asking others to \nsee where you come from is disrespectful. You cannot preach disrespect \nwhile being disrespectful. And again, you cannot be in LOVE with someone, \ngenuine true love and have crushes. So therefore she wasn't in love. I \nmean, even if you could, you wouldn't leave someone for that crush. I feel \nlike you're completely unjustly judging her based off very little \ninformation.",

Why would you be with that person in the first place? \nThat's what I mean: people date randomly, for no reason, coming and leaving \nwhenever they feel like doing it. That is morally so wrong. Now tell me I \nshould get more 2015ified, and need to see things as they are nowadays, but \nI can't get past the \" dating but not loving\"thing. Why would you date \nsomeone , if you don't LOVE that person? Same thing goes to sleeping with \nsomeone. I don't how people can actually FIRST sleep with someone and THEN \ndefine he/she as their girlfriend, and what's worse in this is: they sleep \ntogether, and they don't even love each other! Holy crap. I may be too \nbiased here, but that is just my opinion, and for me, if she LOVED that bf \nshe had before Simon, then she was pretty disrespectful; if she was just \ndating him, then , I guess, it's \" normal\" , if none of them were really \ninto it, It's ok.

You don't fall in love with everyone you like or date. \nAnd you cannot help falling in love with someone. It literally just \nhappens. It's not something you can go out and control. Martina didn't \nrealize she liked Simon at all. She didn't sit there and fantasize about \nhim, she did the mature thing and dumped the other guy. Because she is \nhuman she fell for someone else. But because she loves Simon I bet you she \nnever fell for anyone else after him. And you may have your opinion, you \nhave that right. But you are literally calling her disrespectful and in a \nway insulting her for her decision.
