            "text": "The discussion on animal hunting is telling me people are really uneducated \nabout the topic. There is undercover proof that has shown time and time \nagain that animals are never killed humanely in slaughter houses. \nSupposedly humane bolt gun is not so humane after all. It has been proven \nthat the slaughterers use the bolt gun in adequately. The workers kill so \nmany animals, they don't put any effort to comfort the animal. They usually \ndischarge the gun in the wrong place. Some animals just stay conscious even \nafter being shot. Other slaughter houses don't even try to stun the animal. \nThey tie or bind the head in a stretched position and slit the throat. \nThese animals are transported in double decker trucks where they trample \neach other and break legs. They then have to wait in a small and cramped \ncorral until it is time to be killed. Many animals are not fed or watered \nwhile waiting to die. They can smell the blood of others and can hear \nstrange machinery. Many slaughter animals were once treated with at least \nsome respect. Now they are prodded with electric pig prods and are hit with \nmetal rods. In some slaughter houses, horses are incapacitated by jabbing a \nknife into the general spine area. This does not kill the animal. The \nthroat slitting does that. Even a stunned animal wakes up as its throat is \nslit. They thrash in agony as the blood drains out of the cut and the mouth \nand nose. Ocean mammals are killed viciously. Sometimes they are stabbed \nuntil the spine is hit, they have their throats slit, etc. Dolphins and \nwhales are intelligent creatures that have more empathy that we will ever \nhave. They feel pain just like us. Perhaps even more so. We destroy the \noceans by polluting them and to add to that, we brutalize the animals. What \ndoes that tell you about the human race? \ufeff",
