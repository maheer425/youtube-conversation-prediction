The average person probably can't figure out how \nto choose a better partner because the cause is a deep psychological issue. \nShe talks about things as if they weren't a big deal. \n\nIt would probably help most people to look up videos about sociopaths and \nnarcissists.

However I suppose \nit's different for everyone, and I don't know what 'normal' women go \nthrough, since I have co-dependent issues. sighs.\n\ni just know I've done years worth of research and years worth of healing to \nbe able to be a healthier match to healthier people.\n\nSo I gotta say, for vague advice for normal people I suppose this vid is \nok. but as far as any deep psychological level and the relationships being \ntoxic or abusive, this video is a complete failure and may endanger people. \nfor no other reason than they aren't identifying the problem, nor advising \nthe person to get help. \n\nif anyone has any legit worries, you should search up signs of \ntoxic/abusive/narcissistic partners. then go from there.\n\nbe safe.\ufeff",

It was one of those cases where the family used to have \nrelations with the guy so that meant he was at their house a lot so he \nweaseled his way into my cousin's life. He's a heavy drinker and is known \nfor being a little too kind with younger girls around the age range of \n14-19. Her parents, siblings and family expressed their discontent for her \nchoice to be with him, but she remained stubborn. She recently conceived \nhis child and even myself being just 17 knows she's royally screwed up. \nLike I don't get why supposed smart, ambitious and seemingly sensible girls \nput themselves with these sort of guys. I know love makes people crazy, but \nit shouldn't make you mentally ill and plain out stupid. \n\nIn addition to that, I caught what you said about not putting everything \nout there at first to a guy. I find this to be the best advice ever. I'm \ncurrently in college getting to know people, not really looking for \nrelationships because the work is very hard but anyway, there's this guy \nwho's expressed his like for me which sadly I don't return. He keeps asking \nme what I look for in a guy and what makes me me which i find is very hard \nto answer. Yes, his intentions can be totally innocent but I just don't \nlike just randomly giving out facts about myself. I'd much rather just \nspend time with the person and get to scope out their different emotions, \nbehavioural patterns and do things the natural way. So yes. Nice talk\ufeff",

I \nhave depression and the best therapist I ever had was a woman who suffered \nfrom it herself.  All the others, well they tried, but they just didn't get \nit.  It's great to try to learn disciplines from books and education, but \nthere is no substitute for someone who actually lives it.  I love men and \nhave fallen in love with many men over the course of my life, so I feel \nlike I can now tell a younger woman a little about that and maybe advise \nher.  But I would never attempt to tell a gay person how to approach their \nrelationships.  I am certain I do not understand that.  I love rock music \nand some country, especially the oldies and I believe I am a pretty good \njudge of it, but classical and rap, hop-hop, no my appreciation of them is \nvery limited.",

            "text": "Romance vs Stability\n\nRelationships, as almost everything else, are all about cost benefit \ncalculations, correct or false ones, from the beginning till the end, \nthrough ups and downs, best and worst, it's a matter of mental sanity!\nPapers, declarations, engagement, sex, security, insecurity, food, money, \nshared memories, match narratives, common children, etc., are all part of \nthat (impossible) cost benefit calculation.\nThe decision to stay or leave is best described by modern empiric \npsychology and neuroscience, as a random occurrence, at least for most \npeople, because nobody knows obviously, exactly what will come after. \nActually it's just a matter of how adventurous or conservative, a person \nwill feel in the few seconds (or even less), it takes to make a choice.\nInherently weakly shaped people (symptomatically hesitant) or people with \nvery constructed personalities (symptomatically unhesitant) are, for \nopposite reasons,  incapable of deciding anything and beside those \npathologically affected, most people are still so influenceable, that in \nthe end, concluding thinking anyone may decide anything by him or her self, \nis a much too speculative proposition, to build a relevant paradigm upon \nit. Nonetheless so called main stream culture is full of the emotional \ndecision making paradigm.\nIn fact everything about the calculation, is a matter of how much sh.t \npeople like to eat themselves and feed others, mostly out of a combination \nof the denied boredom of being with the same predictable partner and the \nunaware total cluelessness about themselves, called inexperience.\nTo develop an interest in relationships as an instructive topic (or to be \nmore precise an interest in relation-shit) is pure morbidity, considering \nthe above described understanding of how things really work. In the long \nrun, the human lifespan is still far too short compared to the duration of \nthe average ideal relationship, to justify more speculations and avoiding \nrisk taking of making switches. Even children, when they stand in the \n\"middle\", serve as well known accepted excuses for not breaking up. I am \nnot advocating instability but I am proposing that parenting continuity, a \nrequirement of parenthood, is different and sometimes antinomic to the \nintensive care type of relationship often observed. As if paradoxes had \ntheir own inner logic, the more the people base the continuation of a \nrelationship upon the sake of the children, the less they probably identify \nthey true needs or the less they care. Still there is hope, in the one on \none relationship, I call it the passionate romantic relationship, it's not \nless a roller coaster of feelings, but it's greatly intensive one, it's so \ngood, I would label it, self justified. In the frame of a true cost benefit \ncalculation, it's even worth to perpetuate one beyond its natural lifespan \nof mutual sexual attraction, because when luck gave a couple the chance to \ngrab it, how do you expect them to just let it go? For sure in the \nperspective of a lifetime cost benefit calculation, at least for the happy \nfews, that look good enough, or feel good enough with themselves and each \nother, to make it seem realistic, to build their relationship on a \nnarrative based on the romantic paradigm, despite the extremely futile fast \nmotioned aesthetic environment, it beats by far every known occupation in \nhuman history, including drugs, loveless sex and you name it...  \ufeff",

What I have is not an \nirrational bleakness, it's not paranoia and it is not a disorder.  It is a \nlearned behaviour in response to the world around me, which is basically \nnothing but shit.  I am aware there are \"good people\" and that \"good \nthings\" occur.  My argument is and always has been that the bad outweighs \nthe good by orders of magnitude, and I have never seen any evidence that \nI'm wrong.\n\nIt's one thing to say \"it's unhealthy to be depressed\" and you're right, it \nis - it will probably literally kill me one day.  It's quite another thing \nto say it's \"unnatural\".  There is nothing more natural in the world right \nnow than to be depressed.  We have passed the era of mysteries and hopes \nand faith in the unknown.  We know what reality is now, we can measure it \nand document it and we can extrapolate into the future with frightening \nclarity.  And what you see when you do that extrapolation is death, \ndestruction and the end of all life.  There is no hope without radical \nfundamental change in human nature, which is completely and totally \nimpossible.\n\nWe were engineered for a different situation.  We were built to keep \nourselves alive and propagate our species, but we have come to a \nsingularity where doing so is detrimental to both our own kind and every \nsingle other living thing here with us.  Our lives are, simply put, not \nworth living.  What is it that you think makes it worth it?  \"Art\", \n\"beauty\", \"love\", or some other objectively meaningless human construct?  \nOr maybe the faint hope of some miraculous scientific discovery that will \ncure everything?  Two days in a university physics class will rip that \npositivity right out of you - \"There's no such thing as a free lunch\" turns \nout to be one of the most fundamental laws of the universe.\n\nI don't WANT a \"Happy Life\".  If all I wanted was a \"Happy Life\" I would \nhave got a business degree, become a CEO, bankrupted my corporation and \nthen spent my piles of severance money on enough Opium to last a lifetime.  \nLife isn't about \"being happy\".  I want a life that I can believe in.  I \nwant a life that means something.  I want my life to have an impact I can \nbe proud of.  I want my life to leave the world better than it was before I \ngot here.  I want my life to be remembered fondly, not as just another one \nof the seven billion pieces of shit that killed the entire planet.  \nHappiness without fulfillment and meaning is an empty emotion.

Normal people get depressed when \nthey're forced to be alone indefinitely.  They often very quickly stop \n\"loving themselves\".  This even makes perfect sense; from an evolutionary \npoint of view a person who has no reasonable chance of ever mating is \nessentially a waste of food.  Therefore, people that tend to kill \nthemselves when they get too lonely for too long would actually be an \nevolutionary advantage.  And, lo and behold, we live in a world where \nlonely people offing themselves is pretty much a daily occurrence.\n\nI dare you to do some research on the health effects of simply being lonely \nbecause I'm not exaggerating when I say it can kill you.

I know more and more people start \nto feel the same way by the passage of time. I will not and can't store my \npossible future children in this way and many  will agree with me. Also It \ncost money that all people do not have and moreover it's depressing. \nStoring an egg means that the person is concluding that she might not find \nthe one and have to settle as a single mother.\nSince I trust nature above all, not wanting to have kids is not such a bad \nthing. You might have something in your life that you have to achieve, fate \nworks this way ( people say fate, I say TRUE WILL). People who are forced \nto have kids feel trapped and resentment. No parents should feel this way, \nit's not even bad for them it is also bad for their children. People should \nhave children when they are mentally and physically ready.\nThere are things more to life than just having kids. My mother felt \ndepressed when she had to leave her career as poetess. She was a talented \none, she was a good singer, dancer, poetess, novelist, and painter. And she \nleft all for kids. I watched her tears everyday and wished that she would \nstart her career and be happy. But it never happened and now she is gone \nforever. She died with her talents unknown to the world.
