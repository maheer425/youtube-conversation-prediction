Even Toyota group, the biggest car industry in \nthe world, occupies only 2% of the entire Japanese GDP.I am looking forward \nto NK's attack on your tiny SK, and NK and SK will fight each other to the \ndeath, which comes anytime soon.

That's why \nyou will never improve or solve your own problems.

NK's military force is more than \n10,000,000, with all the weapons secretly supplied by Russia and China, \nincluding nukes. Now, what about your joke SK's army? It's only 650,000, \neven though you are drafted...LOL How can you dogs protect your tiny \ncountry with this puny number? The very reason of this NK's huge military's \nexistence is to destroy Seoul in any emergent times. They can fire \nthousands of short-range missiles from DMZ and they will be reached to \nSeoul in a minute, and turn your capital into the sea of fire. What you do \nKoreans do? Japan won't help you. US won't help you. China probably take \nthat advantage to colonize you.That's why you Korean dogs has no hope. In \nKorea, more and more young ones are called \u4e09\u5ec3\u65cf (people gave up 3 things in \nlife). Marriage, childbirth, childrearing. Because there is no good news or \nhope in your joke country...LOL Less and less people can marry, your \npopulation decrease even more rapidly, and more suicide...LOL Mmmmm....what \na beautiful Korean Life!! In 20 years later, more than half the population \nof Korea will be over 65 years old. Considering that SK's population is \nonly 38% of Japan even now, SK is already finished.

We have had our own army called 'Japan's \nself-defence force' and it is one of the strongest in the world.Hey, what a \npity for you K-dogs that you cannot even have a strong army even though you \nhave to be drafted...LOLYou dogs has been selected since you were in a \nkindergarten, ranked even from a elementary school period, being in a \nconstant extreme pressures, and by the time of high school, the lower \ngraded ones are selected and they will be sent to the lowest rank of \nmilitary...LOL What a life eh? Even top-graded ones cannot escape from the \nmilitary duty. You dogs all have to go to the military. But whey SK's army \nso weak? LOLYou will be completely defeated by NK whenever you will have to \nfight them. There is no hope in your sad little country. That's why more \nand more people are deserting your hopeless country and immigrate to other \ncountries. There are more than 560,000 K-dogs living in Japan, but they are \ndiscriminated by us, not being able to get a proper job. But they are still \nliving in Japan like a parasite. Why? Because there is simply so hope in \nyour sinking peninsula. Also more and more young ones are escaping from SK, \nimmigrating US, Canada...etc.That's why SK's army is getting weaker and \nweaker and NK can destroy your tiny land in anytime they want.I know the \nreality hurts you but you cannot escape from the fact.You coward K-dogs \nbetter face your sad reality.",
