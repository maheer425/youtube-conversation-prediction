He understands \nusing your teeth is strictly for eating food and playing with toys only. \n1) the ouch method - always exaggerate so the understand that humans are \nfragile. \n2) replace and redirect him to a chew toy \n3) muzzle him/her every time they bite. Shout muzzle so they know it's a \npunishment. \n\nOption 3 worked best for me. I got the muzzle for \u00a32 off ebay and within 3 \ndays of using it he finally stopped biting. If however on the rare occasion \nhe does try to bite or chew on my hand or furniture all I shout is 'muzzle' \nand he stops. \n\nHope this helps! \ufeff",

They make all sorts of non-toxic bad tasting sprays \nspecifically to discourage dog biting and chewing (my parents used to spray \nit on my brother's hands to get him to stop biting his fingernails lol). It \nmay take some getting used to, but I think that spraying your hands and \nshoes before handling the dog could help. It also sounds like you keep \nplaying with the dog even when it bites hard by trying to redirect \nattention to a toy. Next time the dog bites hard, stop play altogether and \nignore them for a while so the dog knows that nothing good comes from \nbiting too hard.\n* Also, try rubbing something safe and good tasting for dogs on the toys \n(something like peanut butter or turkey flavored baby food from Gerber). \nThis will help teach the dog that the toys make much better tasting chew \ntoys than human hands and feet.

Allowing \nyour puppy to mouth your hands can only further increase biting and in some \ncases when yelling ouch only further excites or startles your puppy. Best \nmethod is as soon as you get your puppy - teach not me bite toy. Basically \na distraction method. Whenever your puppy bites place one of it toys in its \nmouth and praise. Stoke puppys head when he/she chews on the toy. For more \naggressive biters, gently squish the upper jowl into the teeth and say \ngently no bite. They associate biting you - with biting themselves. \ufeff",
