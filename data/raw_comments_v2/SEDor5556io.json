I can make it street legal here in Indiana with our laws and have \ndone so in the past with a KTM 360MX ...I just putt around these days and \nwill never get it dirty ...and you guys can play with it any time ! i'll \neven bring it back to you when ever you want to do videos on it ! OMG I am \njust now seeing the last of this video and you guys got too many famous \nHusky's too ! you can keep the Hondas , I beat my brains out on most of \nthose years ago in the motocross wars and working as a Honda Mechanic at a \nHonda dealer all week just to rest up to go out again and again to play \nweek end moto warier ! for 20 years ...I want the Harley that I never had ! \n..seen one go for $9 grand a few years ago that was all original and never \nrestored that look new and never raced  ...but where is another one ? you \nguys got one that will probably never be ridden again !   they did place \n2nd at Daytona MX that year at bike week ! and Honda and the AMA ran them \ndown saying things like the \"Harley\" buzzed too high (they would wrap \nand brrrap about 10 grand rpm ) , too pippy always had to be on the \"pipe\" \ngears too close together , front geometry too steep so u had to squire off \nall corners ...suspension too tall and stiff , so u had to double in and \ndouble out all whoop tee do's ...so Honda goes out in 1978 and builds a 250 \nwith almost the same specs ! that ran the same way and won ! ...I bought \none of the Honda look alike in 1979 from Black Canyon Honda in Phoenix \nArizona that sent the preference for building all motocross bikes today \nthat win of the 2 strokes !!! ...but you guys already know all this and \nwill never part with your 1977 MX250 Harley icon ..will you ? and it's not \nreally a Harley it's about if not all Italian of the best fastest stuff of \nthe day ! at least fire it up and put it on this show and let the n00bs \nknow ! and btw Honda failed to produce a 250 in 1977 due to their own \nstupidity with trying to develop the same design as the 1977 Harley so \nthey go and bad mouth Harley for their 1st and then last attempt at \nMotocross. Only placing over all 2nd place at Daytona (only?)..so Honda and \nAMA killed the Harley right out of the gate ..and then Honda goes and \nbuilds one almost exactly like it the following year ! imagine that ??? put \nit on the show and let the n00bs know !\ufeff",
