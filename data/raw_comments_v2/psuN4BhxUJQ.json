And I think it is good \nthat it is dicriminized, because there is more control, we know where \npeople buy and consume and there are less people who try it because it is \nlegal and less interesting. It is now getting used to in these States, but \neventually that will also be a case. I never did drugs and have no \ninterested in it at all. But I am pro choice and being able to control it \nand that is the reason why I would always say that we need to keep our \ncoffee shops. And the statistics prove my point (from a few years ago): \nrougly 20% of the Dutch had tried drugs, while in the USA it was 40%, while \nwe could easily walk to a coffee shop and buy it. But because we are \neducated on drugs and their effects it is been used less and when people \nuse it they know what that type of drug will do. There are still problems \nbut we are also taught that when you end up in the hospital with drugs \nalways be honest with what you took, tehy will not arrest you, they just \nwant to help and in order to do so tehy need to know what is in the body.\ufeff",

Cannabis is an exceptional \nmedicine that cures most of non-infectious diseases, including cancer. \nCannabis oil is the real problem for legalization - because it brings down \ncomplete infrastructure of pharmaceutical industry. That includes all the \ninvestments, not to mention - predicted growth and development of Big \nPharma.  Having a plant that can grow as a weed to compete with giant, \noverpriced  Pharma will shake economies and securities of many countries. \nMillions of people will loose their jobs causing social disturbance. This \nwill bankrupt many rich and influential investors, who have enough money to \ninfluence any politician to prevent legalization of cannabis. I hope that \nclears it for all of you.\ufeff",

Some experience \nacute anxiety and panic, Physically, the pulse rate increases (from between \n20 to 50 per cent above the usual heart rate), the eyes become bloodshot, \nappetite often increases (they get the 'munchies') and coordination can be \naffected, making activities such as driving a car or operating machinery \ndifficult and dangerous. If large doses of cannabis are taken, the \nresulting toxicity can cause symptoms of confusion, paranoia, panic \nattacks, hallucinations and feelings of unreality. New users may also \nexperience acute paranoid experiences which usually stop after intoxication \nwears off. An increased risk of developing cancer of the respiratory tract. \nThese risks are more likely to do with smoking as the method of taking \ncannabis, rather than the properties of the drug itself.\nAn adverse effect on people with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, since \ncannabis use significantly raises the heart rate. (There is no evidence \nthat cannabis use will cause permanent damaging effects to a normal, \nhealthy cardiovascular system.)\nA risk of developing chronic bronchitis, possibly irreversible obstructive \nlung disease, possibly lung cancer and cancers of the aero-digestive tract.\nHeavy use of cannabis is sometimes associated with a reduction in energy \nand drive. This has been referred to as \"amotivation\" (not having any \nmotivation). This problem is more likely to be an acute effect which will \ngo away if cannabis use stops. There is poor evidence of this syndrome \nexisting even among heavy, long-term cannabis users.\nHeavy cannabis use affects the ability to learn. This is related to \ndecreased concentration levels, reduced short-term memory and difficulties \nwith thinking. These problems go away if cannabis use stops.\nChronic, heavy cannabis use can reduce sex drive in some people. It can \nlower sperm count in males and lead to irregular periods in females. This \nproblem goes away if cannabis use stops.\nPeople can become dependent on cannabis (see Cannabis - overcoming problem \nuse).\nMany people with mental health problems also use cannabis. Generally, it is \nnot a good drug for such people to use. People with mental health problems \nneed to try to keep their brain level or stable. Cannabis excites and then \nslows the brain down. In particular, it can make anyone who has ever been \nparanoid, more paranoid.\ufeff",
