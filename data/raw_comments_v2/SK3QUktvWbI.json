I was not always a Christian, I was a semi-pro \nsnowboarder for a decade with full gear sponsorships, competed in \ninternational competitions, & made snowboard movies; but, after reading the \nBible my eyes were opened in the way that the Bible refers to as \"the blind \nbeing made to see,\" & \"the lost shall be found,\" or being \"brought from \ndeath to life.\" That is why you think I am weird; the Bible explains that \nthose who have not been born-again will not understand until they come to \nrepentance of sin and faith in Christ.\nPlease read the Bible for yourself, then you will see that what I'm telling \nyou is True, and it is the Truth that will set you free.
