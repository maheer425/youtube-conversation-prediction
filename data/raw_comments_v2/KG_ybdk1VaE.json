Since the cows eat grass, the milk contain a better omega3/6 ratio and \nother nutrients.\n3. Margarine uses cheap unhealthy oil that has gone through a heating \nprocess which kills natural vitamins, destroy omega 3 (which is more \nfragile than omega 6), and create harmful chemical compounds or \"oxidation \nproducts\".\n4. They also add chemicals to remove taste.\n5. When margarin is produced, the content goes through yet another heating \nprocess under high pressure. This strenghtens the effects mentioned in \npoint 3.\n6. CALORIES DON'T MATTER.
