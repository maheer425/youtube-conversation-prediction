I \ndon't know why I said that but yeah. One time we were getting our Family \nPortrait done and the photographer had a beard and I to say the least was \nnot cooperating to put it mildly I refused to smile and had this mad look \non my face.

Beard and \nnot one of those weird skinny beards that go along the jawline then stop on \nthe middle of their chin tipped off with a douchie like strip of hair that \nstarts near top of the chin down into the douchie thin strips of hair on \nboth sides yuck or just the little patch of hair on the chin.... there are \nalot of douchie facial hair out there actually but just a nice full beard \nlooks good with maybe some long sideburns. Like Rhetts beard on Good \nMythical Morning. I have seen younger pictures of him without one and he \njust doesn't look that great no offense to the guy. Has he ever shaved his \nbeard while him and Link had the show? Sometimes when you see a guy with a \nbeard for a long time you start to wonder what they look like then realize \nyou should have just kept wondering for the image in your brain that you \nthought they looked like looks way better then reality. I have seen Zach \nGalifianakis without a beard and it shocked me. He doesn't look have bad \nthough. On Netflix they have the documentary about men in this days \nsociety. How they groom their selves more now then other men did in \nHistory. I wish I could remember what it was .called. I remember I had \nJason Bateman, that one guy that always has an orangeish glow on his skin \nhe plays Jason Bay men's brother I think in Arrested Development. It also \nhad Zach Galifianakis along with some other unknown to me actors with some \nregular men too. They showed this Barber guy that specializes in wigs for \nbald men it's crazy how well he can make the hair look on them. If I didn't \nsee some of the guys getting their wigs getting out on i would have never \nknown. I also watched some videos on little house's on YouTube there was \none house that had these wall that were on wheels or something so the cult \nsave on space they have to move the walls to make the room into a Living \nroom then one that shaped into a bedroom then Kitchen and bathroom it was \nsomething I have never seen before which I guess isn't saying much since I \nhavent seen a lot of things since birth but still I think anyone would \nthink it atleast interesting. It does look like alot of work to get to the \nbathroom what if they they had to poop really bad or pee and they had to \nwait to get to it then oopsy accidentay",
