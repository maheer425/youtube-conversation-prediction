It wasn't until I heard Mother's voice that I knew \nsomething else was going on here. Then after Crane was murdered, the focus \nshifted and it was slowly revealed that the story was not about her, it's \nabout *him*. Great movie.",

Not much left to be said about this \npicture that hasn't been recounted before. Well, if you've seen it as many \ntimes as I have, you may appreciate the fact that much of the film is very \ndark comedy:\n\n\"Mother - how shall I say? -- isn't herself today.\"\n\nOr we could talk about how Marion Crane's last name links thematically with \nthe stuffed birds in the office and parlor of the Bates Motel.\n\nOr that this film is the first in cinema history to show the flushing of a \ntoilet.\n\nOr that Bernard Herrmann's musical score consists entirely of stringed \ninstruments.\n\nOr that director Alfred Hitchcock was so impressed with the 1955 French \nfright film Diabolique, directed by Henri Georges Clouzot, that he resolved \nto make a picture even more terrifying. I would argue he succeeded -- \nthough just barely.\n\nOr consider this (possibly apocryphal) story: an irritated viewer wrote \nHitchcock to say that his daughter, after seeing Diabolique, would no \nlonger take a bath and that after viewing Psycho she refused to shower as \nwell. Hitchcock's reply?\n\n\"Send her to the dry cleaners.\"\n\nPsycho remains a masterpiece of misdirection, audience manipulation and \nmacabre humor. It's also on the very short list of scariest films I have \nseen, and I have seen a few. For that rare first-time viewer who has no \nclue what's coming, Psycho is gut-wrenching. Only Jaws and Silence of the \nLambs come close.\n\nAnyway, Hitchcock's cameo occurs about six minutes into the film. He's \nstanding outside a real estate office, improbably wearing a cowboy hat.\n\nWe All Go a Little Mad Sometimes - Psycho (3/12) Movie CLIP (1960) HD\ufeff",
