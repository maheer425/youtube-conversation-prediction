The senate gives power to \nthe states while the House of Reps, which is proportional, gives power to \nthe people of the states, giving states with more people more power.\nChange 3. Interstate commerce was made so that the states, when first \ncreated during the Constitutional Convention, wouldn't overtax each other \nand to prevent them to act more like independant countries. Back then, \nhaving UNITED states (the states acting as one body) rather than united \nSTATES (Each state very different with one common goal, making it \ncomparable to the European Union of today) was vital to beating the UK in \nthe war.\nSorry for the long post, but hope you agree with me!\ufeff",
