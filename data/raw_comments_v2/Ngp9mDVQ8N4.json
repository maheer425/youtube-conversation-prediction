And for the petrol vehicle, let\u00b4s see... \nthe gigantic oil tanker brings the oil to your country (I can't imagine how \nmuch fuel it spends) then the oil is pumped to the refineries (more fuel or \nelectricity)  then the refinery spends energy and makes pollution to \nfabricate the fuel that we use, then the fuels are taken by trucks to the \nlocal gas station, then you spend a lot of money and fuel to go to the gas \nstation and return. I honestly believe that electric vehicles are far \nbetter than petrol ones. The only problem with electric vehicles is the \nfact that the oil companies are not going to allow car manufactures to sell \naffordable electric cars as long has there is oil to burn.",

I wouldn't say electric vehicles lack fun at all, the \ntwizy is great, direct steering, simple, light so many petrols just lack \nthis basic fun factor. But you are right the noise, the smell, the \nvibrations and manual control of the engine; gearbox and skills required to \ncontrol is not the same. I do love electric cars to drive though, the \nfluid, beautifully smooth delivery cannot be matched, nor can we ignore the \ndamn torque, instantaneous acceleration of electric, in reality of 'normal' \njourneys quiet is just what most of us want! I guess we need to just face \nthe future, in the meantime lets enjoy the petrol we have left. Keep up the \ngood work, in the meantime test the Model-S as I'm bursting at the seams to \ndrive one, and with your honesty and passion I'm waiting for your opinion. \ufeff",
