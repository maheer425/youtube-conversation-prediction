And electrical force \ninteractions (I assume you're talking about Coulombic forces) are photon \ninteractions? Anyway you sound pretty knowledgeable so maybe you can answer \na question that's been plaguing me for a while. \n\nSo I understand that temperature is a macrostate expression for average \nkinetic energy of all particles in a system. Further, I understand that \nrotational and vibrational energy levels of molecules can be excited by \nmicrowave-IR frequencies of light. From a classical mechanical perspective, \nit makes sense that mechanical collisions between particles would also \nproduce vibration and rotation in molecules which could then dump that \nrotational/vibrational energy in the form of light, but that light emitted \nwould again be microwave/IR. The difference between rotational/vibrational \nenergy levels isn't high enough to release visible frequencies of light. \nIt's not until you start messing with electronic energy levels that you \nshould see visible light, right? The fact that blackbody radiation occurs \nmust necessarily mean that excitation of electrons to higher orbitals is \nsomehow a consequence of higher average kinetic energy of particles in a \nsystem, but I just don't understand how the two could be directly linked. \nAm I too attached to the notion of understanding things at the nanoscale \nfrom a Classical Physics perspective? Surely there is some way to \nrationalize this phenomenon using the laws of mechanics and E&M. ",

The \n(relatively) long-range interactions between atoms are mediated by photons \n(pretty much everything but gravitation and inter-nucleus forces). In a \nphysical solid, the atoms are close together and sharing/interchanging \nelectrons (an expression of photon interaction). In diffuse systems \n(gasses) the interactions are longer-ranged but driven by electrical force \n(photon) interactions.\nNuclear heating (energy transfer) does involve neutrons, which are \nelectrically neutral particles and can transfer energy by other means \n(gluon interactions), so the heating of stars and hot planet cores is way \nmore complicated [and beyond my solid grasp]. But for the basic case of, \"I \nput a hot thing against a cold thing,\" or, \"I put a hot thing near a cold \nthing in a closed system,\" the answer is ultimately that the energy is \ntransferred by photons.",

This quantity depends on the difference between energy \nlevels of each electron of the atom. It's just like whole numbers, let's \nsay your electron wants to lose 27 units of energy but it can only radiate \naway packs of 3,4,7 and 9... There are multiple possibilities but lets \nconsider this example: (9+7+4+7), in this case the sum is 27 so the \nelectron managed to lose all the excess energy and return to the lowest \nenergy level. In other cases sometimes the electron doesn't make it all the \nway down to the lowest energy level for example (9+9+7), here the sum is 25 \nand we can't lose the 2 remaining units of energy because the electron \ncan't radiate a pack of two.",
