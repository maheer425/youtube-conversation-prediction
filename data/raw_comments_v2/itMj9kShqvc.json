The color of a flame depends on chemical \nreactions in the flame, not the temperature of a flame.\n*_________________________*\n\nIt is misleading to make the general statement that \"blue is *hotter* than \nyellow or orange\" \n\nThe different colors in a flame are a result of *different physical and \nchemical processes* within the flame, not strictly because of differences \nin temperature. (most web materials get this wrong....) \n\nIf you read the fine print in a good physics book, you will find that a \nblue color corresponds to a temperature of about 20,000 degrees and \nupwards. This is far hotter than any known flame, and the only places you \nare likely to find these kind of temperatures is in electric arcs, \nlightning bolts, and very hot stars. Most flames are on the order of 1,500 \n- 4,000 degrees, the hottest being an oxygen+acetylene welding flame, which \nis around 5,000 degrees, about that of a lightbulb. Not hot enough by far \nto produce a blue color.... \n\nSo where does the blue color come from? \n\nThe blue color is caused by \"chemiluminescence,\" this is light which is \nproduced *directly* from the chemical reactions of combustion, not \nindirectly as a result of heat (e.g. a red hot stove, or light bulb \nfilament...) \n\nSo where does the yellow color come from? Why are some flames white-yellow, \nand some flames completely blue? \n\nIf some region of a flame does not have enough oxygen to burn completely, \nit will begin to form tiny soot particles. These soot particles are far \nmore dense than the surrounding gas, so they glow a nice bright yellow \ncolor. As they reach the top of the flame, in-rushing air brings enough \noxygen to burn up the soot particles completely. \n\nA reddish or orange flame usually means it contains excess soot or \nimpurities; such flames will usually produce a lot of smoke. in particular, \na yellowish orange comes from excess sodium. \n\nA flame that has enough oxygen, or a correct ratio of fuel to air, won't \nproduce any soot at all, thus eliminating the bright yellow color. \nIncidentally, such flames usually burn more efficiently than those that are \noxygen starved, hence the misleading assumption that \"blue is hotter\" \nFlames that don't contain carbon, such as those of burning hydrogen, \nammonia, or sulfur, are usually bluish or colorless..... \n\nProbably way more than you wanted to know about fire.... \n\n---SPACEFACE *105*\n\nSource(s):\n\no)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemiluminescence\no)http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/3B.html\nNote that blue flames are usually at the bottom of a flame, and orange near \nthe top.",

Historically, the name refers \nto the Bavarian Illuminati, an Enlightenment-era secret society founded on \nMay 1, 1776. The society's goals were to oppose superstition, obscurantism, \nreligious influence over public life and abuses of state power. \"The order \nof the day,\" they wrote in their general statutes, \"is to put an end to the \nmachinations of the purveyors of injustice, to control them without \ndominating them.\"[1] The Illuminati\u2014along with Freemasonry and other secret \nsocieties\u2014were outlawed through Edict, by the Bavarian ruler, Charles \nTheodore, with the encouragement of the Roman Catholic Church, in 1784, \n1785, 1787 and 1790.[2] In the several years following, the group was \nvilified by conservative and religious critics who claimed that they \ncontinued underground and were responsible for the French Revolution.\nIn subsequent use, \"Illuminati\" refers to various organisations which claim \nor are purported to have links to the original Bavarian Illuminati or \nsimilar secret societies, though these links are unsubstantiated. They are \noften alleged to conspire to control world affairs, by masterminding events \nand planting agents in government and corporations, in order to gain \npolitical power and influence and to establish a New World Order. Central \nto some of the most widely known and elaborate conspiracy theories, the \nIlluminati have been depicted as lurking in the shadows and pulling the \nstrings and levers of power in dozens of novels, movies, television shows, \ncomics, video games and music videos.",
