I guarantee everyone on here is 11 \nor 12 years old. \n\n                 The Hashashins were an Islamic order in the levantine \nempires of Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Israel. The crusades started when Muslims \nwere attacking Christian pilgrims, because the Muslims were defending the \n\"holy land.\"\nThe Knights Templar were farmers, and other pilgrims who wanted to protect \neach other. Eventually when the Templar Order became popular, they started \nto rake in the money, and like most large religious organizations, became \ncorrupt.\n\n                 The Shia-Muslims wanted to fight back, I'm not sure of the \nexact history; but the Hashashins (H'assassins) were founded to fight the \nKnights Templar. The Muslim people took back almost all of the holy land, \nfrom Iraq to Italy. The Crusades had no winner, because the Templars did \nget the pilgrims into the holy land, but after the 7th Crusade, when the \nlast, I guess you could call them embassies, fell to the Shia-Muslims, the \nTemplars withdrew from the Holy Land altogether, and stayed in Europe.\n\n                     The Illuminati was a Bavarian (A state in Germany) \nsecret society. The Illuminati were given permission by the Catholic Church \n(who were corrupt) to form. The Illuminati is responsible for starting two \nRevolutions (French, and American.) The Catholic Church wanted to control \nthe world, which is why they started the two revolutions. The Knights \nTemplar were a Catholic/Christian order, and they fought the Muslims for \ncontrol of the world at the time, which was Europe, and Asia. It is \npossible that the Catholic Church reformed the Templar order into the \nIlluminati to try to control the world again, but those are just theories. \nThe catholic church is still very corrupt, and is likely trying to control \nthe religious world. Religion is a scam, and is is just used to get money \nout of people.\ufeff",
