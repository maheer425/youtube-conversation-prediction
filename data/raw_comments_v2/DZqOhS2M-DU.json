Joe Wright, director ,made it clear that when \nElizabeth was in Pemberley,seeing all those sculptures and decorations also \nmeant seeing Darcy's style and appreciation of beauty, which also helped \nher in understanding more about his character -- though I do agree that \nthis wasn't clear; normal interpretation would be that realizing his wealth \nchanged her mind.

She's infinitely whiny, and not remotely believable when \nshe suddenly turns to \"loving\" Darcy. There's no chemistry between them, \nand it seems seeing Pemberley changed her mind more than anything else.\nIt seems to me that, had Colin Firth not been cast, the whole series \nwould've been forgotten at this point; the only way it's ever mentioned is \nin conjunction with Firth.

Darcy was similar. That's why the script \nfor this movie described Darcy as \"brooding with introversion.\"\n\nIf anything, be mad at the fact that Georgiana was wrongly portrayed in \nthis movie.",
