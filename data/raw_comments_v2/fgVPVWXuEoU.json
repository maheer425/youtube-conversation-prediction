Towards the beginning of the \nclip the horse paws the ground to get down to roll - the dog recognises \nthis as a bath and get in the water trough at the same time.  That is a \nreally close understanding between these two,.  I notice  also that the dog \nunderstands that the horse has less special awareness and has the option to \nduck under the wire fence out of the way when necessary!  Great vid - will \nprobably watch it again and  every so often.\ufeff",
