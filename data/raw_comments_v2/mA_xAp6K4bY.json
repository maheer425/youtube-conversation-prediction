Real yams are a totally different \nclass of root vegetable. A yam looks like a log, hefty and thick, with \nbarky skin and a white or yellow flesh. When you cut into it it yields a \nkind of sap like okra. Whole wheat bread IS WHOLE grain ground into flour. \nWhole grain bread is varies from brand to brand. Most of the time it's \nWHITE flour with different whole seed grains tossed in to make it look more \nwholesome--not usually more nutritious than whole wheat. And did you notice \nthey threw in some unpopped popcorn in the whole grain example--stupid. \nGreen peppers are just unripe sweet peppers. Yellow, orange and red peppers \nare all ripe and very sweet. If you were to let a green pepper ripen it \nwould turn yellow orange or red (just not the ones you buy at the store \nbecause they are usually picked way too early).\ufeff",
