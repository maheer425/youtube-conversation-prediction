The sword closely resembles the nodachi or odachi, however it \ndiffers from the nodachi by having a ricasso of approximately 12 to 18 \ninches (460 mm). This lends more to the theory of the sword having a \npractical use in feudal Japan. The increased length of the blade, along \nwith the extra grip, would give it dual use both as a sword and as a \npolearm for attacking advancing cavalry. This style of zanbato sword can be \nfound for sale in rural tourist shops and stands in Kyoto and Nara \nprefectures of Japan. This sword may have been inspired by the Chinese zhan \nma dao as both were said to have been used for killing the horse and rider \nin one swing. It is likely that the zanbato is actually a mis-construction \nof the zh\u01cen m\u01ce d\u0101o, poorly drawn or translated by Japanese travellers who \nwitnessed the weapon being used during battle.\n-----------------------------\nzanbato weapon is closed to Cloud strife's Blade\ufeff",
