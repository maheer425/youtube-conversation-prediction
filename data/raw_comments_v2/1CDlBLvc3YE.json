While earlier Don \nCorleone could live peacefully among the other Dons (who attended Connie's \nwedding in the beginning), they then threatened his family, so retaliation \nwas ultimately necessary.\n\nThe 'peace conference' meeting in the movie was about the loss of Sonny \nCorleone and Bruno Tattaglia and peace, but when Barzini pushed the \nnarcotics issue instead Vito then realized that he wasn't treated as an \nequal any longer and that the other four Dons would try to take the power \nhe wouldn't give them.",

Moe Greene was \nbeating back the Corloenes in Vegas and as a member of Murder Inc. had to \nbe eliminated if the Corleones were going to settle in Nevada.\n\nyour Don Corleone with morals won his territory by beating another gangster \nin the brutal Olive Oil War prior to events in the Godfather. He used Luca \nBrasi as his assassin without hesitation.\n\nWe see how Don Vito loved his children and his closest associates, but he \ntoo knew when to get rid of his enemies. He was Michael's consigliere when \nthe war against the Tattaglias was the worst, and the killings of the other \nDons are his idea as he knows their sucessors are not as strong as his own \nson Michael and will sue for peace, leaving the Corleones as number 1.\n\nIn the book, Cuneo and Stracci do not die and become allies of the \nCorleones even though they did conspire with Barzini and Tattaglia to take \nCorleone turf initially.
