Now squeeze as hard as you can using only that one hand. Try as \nyou might, the egg will not break. unless you cheat by putting pressure on \nthe sides of the egg. The ovoid shape of the egg distributes pressure very \nwell making it less likely for the egg to break when a big fat mother hen \nis sitting on it. It is a really cool experiment so go try it out. do it \nover the sink or outdoors just in case. sometimes the egg will break if it \nhas inherent defects that weaken the shell.
