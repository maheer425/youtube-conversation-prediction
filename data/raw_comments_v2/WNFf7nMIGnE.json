They are laughing with him. \nLin-Manuel Miranda is known for combining serious subjects with comedic \ntiming and deadpanning. Deadpanning is a technique that he uses in a lot of \nhis shows. 2:14 is a perfect example of what people in theater call \n\"deadpanning\" and/or comedic timing with facial gestures and words \n\"Alexander Hamilton\". Look at his eyes when he says Alexander \nHamilton...he's doing that on purpose to get a laugh...that's a mix of \ndeadpanning and comedic timing. Even his piano player is already laughing \njust before he says it. He did a lot of this type of comedic timing and \ndeadpanning in his Tony winning musical In The Heights...that's his style. \nThe laughter at the beginning is because Lin-Manuel jokingly says that \nSecretary of Treasure Alexander Hamilton embodies Hip Hop...that's funny, \nand it was meant to be funny. Again, that's Lin's style of mixing comedy \nwith serious subjects.\ufeff",
