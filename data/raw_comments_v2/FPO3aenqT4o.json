Our media has a way of showing all terrorists \nas anyone that doesn't have white skin, conditioning people to relate brown \nskin to danger. As a result it could mean people are less likely to protest \nagainst police brutality towards brown people (which is a HUGE issue right \nnow in America).

Feelies represent the \nmedia which distracts people and makes them feel better. Its easier to see \nwhat the Kardashians are doing than it is to recognize that you live in a \nsick society. Lastly, the ritual orgies represent the societal pressures \nthat are exerted on all of us. There is this idea that you shouldn't be \ndifferent, that you shouldn't rock the boat.\n\nWe don't need to be afraid of Big Brother because most people are going to \nbe too distracted to even realize he is already there.\n\nEdit: That being said I think 1984 is a better book.",

So \nyes, your assertion is correct. I am saying that Utilitarianism is the main \ndriving force behind the repressive gov't in BNW.\n\nAnd that speech Mond has with The Savage is a utilitarian form of thinking. \nNot to mention when Mond expresses the society's views towards other forms \nof knowledge, such as incorrectly making statements about philosophy being \na branch of religion (which it is not) which is what the new atheist \nmovement's thoughts towards other sources of knowledge; they are useless \nand only science is the only source of knowledge.\n\nActually happiness and individuality can go together. That is if happiness \nis taken in moderation. For instance if one were to pursue intellectual \nhappiness such as reading fine literature such as Shakespeare or writing a \npoem, both of which Huxley emphasized the importance of in the book. The \nkind of happiness that the World State practices is one of hedonistic \nhappiness, or what Aristotle called pleasure or self-indulgence.\n\nAnother point Huxley also emphasized the kind of loneliness that John the \nSavage experiences when he goes into self-exile after his experiences with \nthe Native American peoples and the World State, giving need for community. \nNot having other intellectual friends like Helmholtz Watson or Bernard Marx \naround is lonesome for the Savage and it's worse when the crowd of \nhedonists surround him making him feel more alone and further isolated. All \nhe really has is just his traditions.\n\nNow to look at BNW from a virtue ethicist point of view, or as Aristotle \nwould see it, it is best for the individual to take moderation in \nhappiness, for too much leads to self-indulgence or pleasure and less leads \nto sorrow.
