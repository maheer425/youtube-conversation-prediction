Any simulation is limited by a certain entropy density. This \nmeans a maximum limits to information that can be stored. Like a hard drive.\n\nIt doesn't matter how advanced, there are limits to entropy. For example to \nsimulate the universe right now, you'd need a computer that had the mass of \nthe universe or at the very least energy of the universe.\n\nIrrational numbers that do not end would mean within the simulation it has \nstorage values that tend towards infinity. Thus disproving any simulation.\n\nThere are other reasons to, from continuous nature of reality to things \nlike certain quantum behavior.\n\nIt doesn't matter in the end; if it's a simulation that does not indicate \nreality still isn't real.

            "text": " Vsauce actually on technicalities you are wrong in the front of not being \nable to save memory as if it was a video game. Think of it loke your skin \ncells they replenish as life goes on but say a wound like a scar would \nstill remain. If we were to use this same idea with the brain so as it dyes \nit transmits information from itself into a type of \"external hard drive \" \nand so this information is then sent to mabye a different body but what \never the case those brain stimulations of smell would remain and other \nchemical interaction could be differently interperted with the new brain to \nremain as he old one. So anyone who commented that we would be immortal \nwould be correct but say a hacker were to bypass the security in place then \nyour well.. screwed they could either stop transmissions, control you, \nchange memories, etc. By the way I have already made papers on this very \nidea so you cant steal it you low live commenters and your tricky ways. Any \nway vsauce thanks if you read this little paragraph and bye.\ufeff",
