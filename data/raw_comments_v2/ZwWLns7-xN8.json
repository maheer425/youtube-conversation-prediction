Let's take everything that made the previous \ngames GOOD and UNIQUE and FLUSH them down the toilet and supplement them \nwith the good old fashioned EA-treatment that we know EVERYONE will love us \nfor. \n\nSeriously, is care, time and effort too much to ask for, EA? Lucasarts made \nthe deadline for Episode III with BF2, and it was a blast. Here? You \ndisappoint and alienate people who have been waiting ten long, painstaking \nyears for a sequel to one of the best Star Wars games, in favor for the \nyoung and dumb Battlefail and Cowadoody audience that you KNOW will buy \nyour games whether they fucking suck or not. EA, if you actually tried \nmaking GOOD games that appealed to both new and old gamers, like \nBattlefront to appeal to us older players, and draw in new players, you'd \ngenerate probably twice or more than what Battlefail 4 made in a year \nwithin the first month, instead of generating a quick buck before it begins \ntrickling into pennies over the months as everyone wakes up to the \nbullshit. The only silver lining I see out of EA owning the license to Star \nWars games is if they let Bioware take another crack at KoToR again... \nMaybe even give us an HD remaster for next gen consoles (I actually would \nlegitimately pay for that...).\n\nPeople, if you want a GOOD Battlefront game, with everything EA is taking \nAWAY from it, get Star Wars Battlefront 2 on Steam (Summer sale is coming \nup too, so now's a chance for a good deal). EA may have tried taking away \nthe online multiplayer on this one, but thank god there's something called \nthird party support.\n\nGot friends who are tired of hating the Nazis? Tell them what EA did to \nBattlefront then. Christ, there's nothing fucking sacred on this Earth \nanymore.\ufeff",
