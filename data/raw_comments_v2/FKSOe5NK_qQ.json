After copying \nEVERYTHING my classmate told me I only had to copy what was in blue. I \nblinked and realized that about a third of the text projected was a really \ndark blue-ish-black. I also noticed this happened with green.\n\nThe same year my history teacher was talking to me about my grades and told \nme that I need to copy the red part of the text book in red, blue in blue \nand black in black.\n\nI never, in the 9 weeks leading up to then even noticed that there was \ncolor in the book at all (other then the illustrations) and I was so \nsurprised (and kinda in denial) I got a textbook and looked at it right \nafter she told me and realized sure as shit just about 4 out of every 9 \nparagraphs were in color.\n\n\n\nI've come to learn that my right eye sees more green and my left sees more \nred.\n\nSometimes I have trouble telling colors apart (shades I mean) and light \nblue often looks grey or white.\n\nJust in this video I learned that the man on the cross walk thing is white. \nAlways thought he was either a green or a light blue and I was upset to \nlearn that actually, its like learning you've been lied to.\n\nWe take color for granted, I mean, really just stop reading after this \nsentence and take a moment to admire all the color around you in your area.\n\nI love color very much and I think that because I am color deficient I \nappreciate color more (I just noticed the color of the \"post\" button and I \nreally like that color, I thought it was grey) because I am noticing what \ncolors I'm surrounded by and always feel like I'm discovering something \nthat other people can't. It's my selfish pleasure, which is odd for me \nbecause I often am sickened by my disability to use words to make someone \nfeel what I am feeling or to know that I am unable to share my feeling of \ndiscovery or awe.\n\nHowever, this isn't /just/ about me, it's about something that is in my \neyes (rods and cones I mean. The amount or lack of for that matter) that \nmany people have and I was just hoping to share my perspective of color \nwith you people. Those of you whom wonder what it is like to be color \ndeficient and those of you whom are.\n\n\nBEFORE I GO IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF \nCOLOR-\"BLINDNESS\"\n\nI posses some red-green color blindness.\ufeff",

Because \nhow can you say dark blue is a shade of light blue? The term \"blue\" is \ninvented by humans. It's just one way to categorize colors. There are \ncertain cultures that categorize colors differently. For example they may \ncategorize colors by how dark they are. So dark colors is one category and \nlight colors is another. They may have a hard time with seeing differences \nbetween colors that we see as obviously different (for example dark green \nand dark blue may look pretty similar to them when we see them as \ncompletely different colors, but light blue and a bit darker blue are the \nsame color to us, but they may see a big difference between them because of \nthe way they categorize colors).\n\nBut yeah, my point is, color blind people still see different shades and \nthey are taught \"this is blue, this is green, this is red...\" They may see \ngreen and red as pretty similar, just like we see turquoise as close to \ngreen and blue. But we can still tell \"this is turquoise and this is green\" \neven though turquoise is \"just a shade of green\".\n\nYeah, I do realize that for example red and green look pretty similar to \npeople with green-red color blindness (just like turquoise and blue or \ngreen look pretty similar to us). But they are still taught the way we \ncategorize colors. And they are born with the color blindness, so they must \nbe a lot better with recognizing subtle differences than we are (I mean, if \nyou suddenly became color blind, it would be different than for somebody \nwho has always been color blind).\n\nI mean, even though green-red color blind people see red and green as \npretty similar, they are still taught they are different colors, so I would \nguess they would still see them as different colors, because they are \ntaught they are way different. What if we didn't have any way to categorize \ncolors? How would we see them?\ufeff",
