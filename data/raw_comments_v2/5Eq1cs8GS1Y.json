I ask that \neveryone who are creeped out by asmr, non understanding of asmr, and anyone \nwho sees it for the first time. Should please wait, watch many videos and \nresearch about it. It really helps when you are stressed or just cant \nsleep, and even if you still don't like it then please keep it to yourself. \nThere are so many asmrists and so many different asmr videos, so please \ngive asmr a chance. I recommend watching the queen of asmr gentlewhispering \n, also ASMRequest , and last heather feather . They are many people's \nfavorites!!! :)\ufeff",
