As the \ndaughter of a prominent Noxian general many paths were open to her, but she \nrejected them all for the path of the blade. Rigorously trained by the \nfinest assassins in Noxus, her father the best among them, it was not long \nbefore Katarina demanded her first assignment. The task they gave her was \naggravatingly simple: assassinate a low-ranking Demacian officer. As she \nset to her work infiltrating the enemy camp, Katarina discovered an \nopportunity too tantalizing to pass by - the arrival of a Demacian General. \nStalking him to his tent, she quietly dispatched his guards and slit his \nthroat. Pleased with her impressive kill, she disappeared into the night. \nKatarina's elation faded the next day when her original objective, the \nDemacian officer, led his forces to ambush unprepared Noxian soldiers. \nThough the Noxians fought valiantly, they suffered heavy casualties. \nFurious at her mistake, Katarina set off to complete her original task. \nReturning to the camp, she spied her now heavily guarded target and \nrealized a stealthy kill was no longer possible. Drawing her blades, \nKatarina swore the officer would die, no matter the cost. She leapt into \nbattle, unleashing a whirlwind of steel. One by one blades flashed and \nguards fell, each strike bringing her one step closer to the officer. A \nfinal thrown dagger restored her honor. Bloody and bruised, Katarina barely \nescaped the Demacian forces, and returned to Noxus a changed woman. The \nscar she earned that night now serves as a constant reminder that she must \nnever let passion interfere with duty.\n\n''Never question my loyalty. You will never know what I endure for it.''\n-- Katarina\ufeff",

Every Laning Phase Match up is a Skill \nmatch up. Why do u say Katarina looses against Malzahar ? yea thats \nactually true but still skill match up. Katarina Mains shits on Malzahar \nplayers if they dont know how to play against her. Only good Malzahar \nplayers can win this Match up or people who knows how to Trade/Freezing the \nLane. And the thing with TF do u ever heard Missle Speed ?? Katarina shits \non TF because he dont have a Insta Stun like Renektons W or something like \nthat. thats why u can easily kill a TF but the thing is he dont have a \nSingle Escape which makes him hard to escape against a Feed Katarina. And \nthe Third thing a feed Katarina destroys everyone it makes sense if u guys \nfeed she one shots u its the same like Nidallee,Zed,Khazix,LB or other high \nburst champions i dont really know what u guys expect. And btw a Good \nKatarina destroys Lissandra mains if they know how to time. And ur Unranked \nsays everything about ur QQ against Katarina the things what u trying to \nsay makes no even sense. And idk what u trying to explain do u low elo \nplayers want that Riot to remove her Passiv `? u guys can wait like 10000 \nYears and this will never happen beacuse thats the Unique thing was \nKatarina has. And what im trying to Explain which i think u still dont \nunderstand with the Elo thing People know which time Katarina uses her \nUltimate annd when to use the CC on her. If u cant lane against her take \nExhaust thats litterally the best Early counter against her. If u know how \nto play against her take Ignite. And if u see someone picks Katarina just \npick Kassadin. Kassadin is the best Pick against her because her Ult will \nbe useless same like her Q which u can block with ur magic shield.",
