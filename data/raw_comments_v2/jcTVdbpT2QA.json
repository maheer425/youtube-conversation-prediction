            "text": "The state of California is suing nine top food manufacturers, including \nBurger King, Heinz and McDonald's, over their reluctance to issue warnings \nthat some of their snacks could contain the potentially cancer-causing \nchemical acrylamide.\n \nAcrylamide was found to be linked to cancer in 2002. Then, the Swedish Food \nAdministration reported high levels of it in carbohydrate-rich foods, such \nas french fries and potato chips, cooked at high temperatures. Studies \nindicated the chemical caused cancer in rats.\n \nBut the link between rats and what humans consume wasn't enough to scare \npeople into taking a closer look at the food they put in their bodies. No, \nthat took Morgan Spurlock, who in his documentary \"Super Size Me\" pointed \nout the dangerous effects of eating an all-McDonald's diet, which included \nweight gain, mood swings, sexual dysfunction and liver damage.\n \nMcDonald's soon after the film's early 2004 festival premiere stopped its \npractice of offering supersize meals. (To be fair, several people have \nchronicled their all-McDonald's diet regimes showcasing weight loss.)\n \nUnfortunately for food manufacturers, no matter the result of these diet \nexperiments, they prove the same point: people need to know what's in the \nfood they're ordering so they can make an informed decision about what \nthey'll eat.\n \nGranted, stipulating that certain foods may cause cancer is rather an \nextreme measure that should give pause to even the most careless food \njunkie. But then again, lots of people still smoke cigarettes.\n \nWhat the state of California is seeking is disclosure. Under California law \n(Proposition 65), companies are required to warn consumers about products \nthat contain chemicals known to cause cancer or birth defects. Acrylamide \nhas been on the state's list of potentially hazardous chemicals since 1990.\n \nState Attorney General Bill Lockyer is suing McDonald's, Burger King, \nWendy's, KFC, H.J. Heinz, Cape Cod Potato Chips, Frito-Lay/Pepsi, Kettle \nFoods, and Procter and Gamble to force the disclosure. One proposed label \nwould look like this: Warning: Baking, roasting, frying and toasting \nstarchy foods forms acrylamide, a chemical known to the state of California \nto cause cancer.\n \nSuch an admittance, however, could pose wide-ranging legal, manufacturing \nand public-relations problems for food manufacturers. Think of it as the \ntobacco industry when it was loathe to admit its products caused harm.\n \nThe food industry is seeking an exemption to Proposition 65 requirements, \narguing that acrylamide is a naturally occurring chemical. The industry \nalso seems to be afraid of consumer backlash to any warning about \npotentially harmful food.\n \nAcrylamide is only a trace chemical, they argue, and there are other, \nmore-direct causes of cancer; therefore disclosure would produce an \nunnecessary public \"scare.\" (The chemical seems to only compound to toxic \nlevel when products are heated above 100 degrees.)\n \nAnd the acrylamide debate isn't the only one in the food business. Today, \nthe seafood industry is resisting putting out warnings about high levels of \nmercury in certain types of fish.\n \nAlready, the stock-market value of companies in the food and restaurant \nindustry has been trending down over the past few months (for a variety of \nreasons). But with several private lawsuits pending in Los Angeles County \nSuperior Court holding food companies accountable for product disclosure, \nthese companies could be in for an even bigger downturn.\n \nThe food industry's supersize fight to defend its position seems a waste of \neffort at best because people easily forget and ignore warning labels.\n \nWhen is the last time an investor really took pause to consider the \ndisclosure \"Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future \nresults?\" Do you actually not swim and take heed of \"Lifeguard not on duty\" \npostings? Movie ratings have also lost their effect. (Or am I the only one \nwho wonders how so many kids get seated at R-rated films?) Even the mother \nof all warnings about tobacco has lost some of its punch. There are \nanalysts and commentators (read: James J. Cramer) who are recommending \ntobacco stocks again.\n \nIt should be remembered that the first warning labels on cigarette packages \nwere issued in 1966, more than 30 years before the tobacco industry had to \nsettle with the government and pay its historic fine in restitution of the \nharm its products inflicted.\n \nThe fast-food and snack industry is in a position to stand behind health \nand nutrition, support what is good for us and disclose what may be bad. It \nwould be a landmark and refreshing move if it would do so. And it wouldn't \nbe so tough for the industry to swallow.\ufeff",
