If it assumes an up \nshift and you give it a down shift this can result in a really slow down \nshift (near 1 second in some cases). This is because if you are in second \ngear and the second set is in 3rd gear it suddenly has to change that from \n3rd gear to 1st gear before it can execute the shift. \n\nReally there are many different types of transmissions with different pros \nand cons associated with them, no one transmission is the king of all \ntransmissions.

I'm sure \nthey really are, but in terms of the speed of a gearshift, it just doesn't \nseem to be as instant as a dual-clutch or even the ZF8, the reigning \nchampion of torque converter-based automatics. Still, it's good enough that \nI'd place it third below those two gearboxes, based on my own experiences. \nIf it was my money on the line, I'd get the seven-speed manual gearbox. \nhttp://www.kbb.com/car-news/all-the-latest/2015-corvette-stingray-inside-gms-new-8_speed-gearbox/2000011074/\n\nThe only gripe we had with the new automatic involved paddle shift response \ntimes. While GM claims its 8-speed can shift .08 seconds quicker than \nPorsche's PDK, there is still a noticeable delay between the time you \ndepress the paddle shifter and the physical gear change. This, of course, \nis not an issue with PDK.",
