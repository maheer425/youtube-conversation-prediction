There would surely be an equilibrium point where \nthe distance between any two massive objects balances the gravity and \nantigravity (or gravitational attraction and \"dark energy\" repulsion), but \nthe force of the initial expansion of the singularity at the Big Bang \nimparted enough momentum to overcome that equilibrium and antigravity got a \nboost.

As in, what if instead of dark energy \nthere is a \"bubble\" of sorts that has the width of the extra space that \nexists that doesn't account for the observable universe (about a radius of \n30 billion light-years), but has the density of a black hole evenly \neverywhere with the universe having a fixed size? If that were the case, \nthen the \"bubble\" would be so uniformly dense that light would not be able \nto pass through it. However that would effectively stop light, which is \nimpossible because the speed of light is a constant and so the only \npossibility would be for light to quantum-tunnel from the outside of the \n\"bubble\" to the inside, and this process just takes light more time to get \nto us, (as in the extra 30 billion light-years that we can't see yet). As \nlight wouldn't actually get to the \"bubble\" and simply passes to the other \nside, then the \"bubble\" couldn't actually be seen since light wouldn't \nreflect it, which is why we can see no evidence of such a phenomenon.  And \nthe bubble slowly degrades into entropy with the edge being the energy that \nis being expended, which is why it takes light less time then to reach us \nand why we think that space is expanding when in reality, it is simply \nreaching us faster because space is actually shrinking, (or at least the \nspace in the hypothetical \"bubble\"). In fact, this could be the process \nthat occurs in every black hole, effectively creating it's own universe \nthat one would think too small to exist, however it expands in itself, just \nas our universe is theorized to be doing.\n\nI realize that this is a pretty long comment, but I would appreciate any \nfeedback as to why or why not this theory could actually be plausible. :)\ufeff",

His earlier \ntheories had a problem in that, they predicted that space must either be \nexpanding or contracting, and it could never be something in between.\n\nThis was used to support Steady State Theory, which was the original way \nscientists tried to avoid the \"God\" question.  Physicists don't like \nbeginnings, because it implies that even physical reality must have had a \ncause.  If physical reality had a cause, then Naturalism is false, and many \nscientists subscribe to Naturalism.\n\nScientists, unable to avoid the prospect of a beginning of time, now try to \nattack philosophy by saying that quantum mechanics defy the laws of logic, \nand thus they can say anything they want.  \ufeff",

The present accelerators that discovered God Particle is going to \nbe upgraded at huge cost. Any information that accumulated from western \nmaterial perspective is not going to give us the knowledge that we seek, \nfor it is looking at one side of reality; actually the inferior side. West \nhas failed to integrate life into their quest for knowledge. If the \nuniverse is blowing up then there should be \u201cBLOWER\u201d WHO IS BLOWING IT AND \nWHO HAS BANGED IT. The East in contrast understood the futility of human \nmind and its extensions to perceive the truth. They knew gravity field and \nits centripetal character. They possibly knew singularity, black hole and \nparallel world. They also knew that truth exist in the black hole and one \nhas to enter it to discover it.  They discovered a short cut to the \nparallel world by turning the focus of their mind 180 degrees to look \nwithin. Thus they travelled into black hole and discovered the parallel \nspace-time field that unites creates and sustain everything. The world they \nexperienced outside now looked simply a mirror image.  Every theory in the \noutside world also existed in this parallel world. They discovered the \nrelativity and singularity except that the singularity of this world is not \nblack world but a \u201cWHITE ONE\u201d whoever enters it gains Life and Light. There \nis a paradox here. Those who have not turned their mind can never \nunderstand what the person who has entered the parallel world speaks to \nthem. The paradox is explained by the \u201cAllegory of Plato\u2019s Chair\u201d.  Thus \nancient east especially Indian sages developed the art of yoga and \nmeditation such that one can silence the mind to reach the real world of \nlife and order. Just as gravity has many concentric circle or path or \nquantum gradients these worlds too have gradients. To which level one grows \ndepends on how much pay loads he drops to reach the destination. In fact no \nhuman soul on his own capacity can enter black hole and reach the parallel \nworld. It is much more difficult to make a journey to enter \u201cWHITE HOLE\u201d \nsuccessfully to gain Life. What this means we cannot seek Truth or God, \nbecause our search is always associated with intent to conquer and become \nimmortal.  Thus scriptures of both east and west write explicitly that we \ncannot seek Truth, but Truth comes in search of us and that there is a \nDivine Plan. Indian sages very clearly visualized universe as Living Being \nthat works within the frame work of time. Which invariably means, we can \ntrace it down to a SUPRENEBEING, where two and multiple of two worlds are \nconcealed. We can visualize a single cell giving rise to whole system with \ntrillions of worlds. We can trace it further down to an atom and space \nwithin it. It all comes from a small space \u201cWHITE HOLE\u201d where two GOD \nparticles vibrate to give life. There is hope for this world. From within \nthe great disorder and darkness, light and life is bound emerge. Thus I \nwork with hope against many odds \u2013 More about it is explored in the \nfallowing article -  \nhttp://www.thecanadiandaily.ca/john-paily-string-atom-life-soul-consciousness-future-technologies/\n\ufeff",

It could be shown in a sound demonstration \nbut would require a rather large set up... perhaps 110 square miles of \nsound tubing... any large tube that could be bent.  You would then compare \nsounds coming from different distance so see if you get doppler affect.  \nJust think about it... it's all rather simple.  You have to go from A to B \nbut you aren't allowed to take the shortest distance.  This happens for \nevery single star you encounter, or gas cloud, or charged field... for \nbillions of light years of travel.  For every step forward you take 1/8th \nstep (example) backwards.  Now add up those hundreds of thousands of zigz \nand zags.  And remember... when you finally get the light signal, it was \nnot the one aimed where you were billions of years ago... but where you are \nnow.  You are nowhere near where you were in space 15 billion years ago.  \nIn fact, you move billions of miles every year just turning around the \nMilky Way... and it's nowhere near where it was when you FINALLY get the \nlight signature.  If the more distant ones seem shifted, small wonder... \nand some of the blue frequecies may not have made it at all.",

Red shift is also caused \nby the fact that light bends towards stars... and galaxies, and the fact \nthat space has clouds of hydrogen.  The point is, light zig zags it's way \nto us.  And the number of zigs and zags increases exponentially.  You may \nwant to look that word up.  The point is, there is a point in exponential \nlimits where you reach your observable 'edge of the universe'.  Lights from \nthe most distant galaxies may travel 10 times the distance to get here vs a \nstraight line and that can cause doppler affect and you will interpret that \nas red shift.
