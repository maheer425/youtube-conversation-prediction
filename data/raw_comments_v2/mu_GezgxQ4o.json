In the one video where they are \ncompared for time on a track, the 918 won only when the 918 had \"sticky\" \ntires and the P1 had what everyone involved agreed were less than ideal \ntires.  When the P1 was outfitted with decent tires (a more fair \ncomparison) it pretty much obliterated the time posted by the 918.  \n\nAlso, the 918 that is raced on the track is not the same version of 918 \nthat most people will have on the road.  With the McLaren P1 they are the \nsame car.\n\nI have never driven either car but from the videos I have watched a common \ntheme seems to be that the 918 is very impressive and the P1 is mind \nblowing.\n\nAnyways, I think both are awesome cars that I will never own.\ufeff",

As for how the car would drive differently sans \nelectrics, I imagine a little more \"raw\" since it doesn't have quite as \nmuch mass to dampen things down, and acceleration might be slightly less \nlinear feeling as you pull through the rev range because a combustion \nengine will never be able to deliver the type of torque curve that an \nelectric motor can.

The only reason I can think of as to why Porsche chose \nthis system and not the one in the Leferrari and P1 is because it allows \nthe car to be purely electric all the way up to 115kph. In other words, I \nthink Porsche are gambling on 918 customers who are very eco-conscious.  \ufeff",

But \nonce you hit the 200k price I don't see anything better than the 458. \nMcLaren 12C is faster but Ferrari has better handling and limit control. At \nthe 300k+ mark nothing new comes close to the F12. I like different cars at \ndifferent prices cause I am a car lover not a one brand fan boy like some \npeople.",

The P1 should be faster in straight line top speed \nabove 160mph. But Porsche's working on that right now as well. \n\nWho knows with the LaFe?
