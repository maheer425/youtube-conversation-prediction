            "text": "Hi ObiJuanKenobi3, here is a step by step about how to clean its cage..\n\n\n1st. Start by removing your guinea pigs from the cage. When you are \ncleaning the cage out it is best to have the guinea pig in a safe place, \npreferably where you can see them.\n\n\n2nd. Remove any toys, food or water bowls. If your guinea pigs have a water \nbottle it should be fine to leave it on the door while the hutch cleaning \nis in progress.\n\n\n3rd. Remove all the bedding from the cage, trying not to spill any. If you \nhave newspaper underneath the bedding you can simply roll it up, trapping \nthe bedding inside, and remove it. If you don't have newspaper you will \nprobably need to use a brush to sweep it all out.\n \n\n4th. Use  vinegar and water solution to scrub down the cage bottom.\n\n\n5th. Line the cage with your bedding of choice (recycled paper bedding such \nas Critter Care, Aspen wood shavings, or moisture winking fleece over \ntowels). Never use cedar, saw dust, pine that isn't kiln dried, or straight \npaper/newspaper as bedding because all contribute to upper respiratory \nproblems in guinea pigs.\n \n\n\n6th. Add a high quality grass hay such as timothy hay, orchard grass hay, \nor bluegrass hay to the hay holders. Avoid using straw as this can have \nquite sharp ends and could hurt the guinea pigs as they have fairly \nsensitive skin compared to other animals.\n \n\n7th Place the food bowls, water bottles and toys back in the cage.\n\n\n8th. Finally you can put the guinea pigs back in their cage and watch them \nexplore their fresh, clean home.",

Also be \ncareful when putting two males together, even if they are from the same \nlitter. Even with the recommended space for two pigs (10sq ft) there is a \nhigh possibility that the males will fight. Have a back up cage in case \nthis happens. A single guinea pig should have at least 8 sq ft of living \nspace. It is important to do research prior to even going near the animal. \nGuinea pigs are small but can be a lot of work and require a lot of \nattention.
