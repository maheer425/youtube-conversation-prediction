Many pond plants can \nbe a little to overzealous in their growth, so I will need to remove loads \nof them often to keep water parameters within the ideal range. Too much \nplant matter, actually removes oxygen from the pond rather than create it, \nand the oxygen starved environment promotes the formation of methane from \nanaerobic bacteria, toxic algae blooms as those species attempt to fulfill \nniches left open in the now disabled plankton food web, and widespread \ndeath of flora and fauna in and around the locality. This is where the \ngrass carp come in, kept in another pond at low stocking density so that \nthey have plenty of room.\n\nBeing herbivores, they consume the plant matter, excreting ammonia in the \nform of urine and feces. Bacteria in the system convert this NH4 into NO2, \nthen into NO3. The nitrate is extremely toxic to fish, which is way water \nchanges are necessary when keeping them as pets. \n\nInstead of just pouring it down the sink, however, I will irrigate it out \nto my garden. Although some terrestrial plants are able to access \natmospheric nitrogen via symbiotic bacteria, such relationships are limited \nto the legume family, and thus is out of reach of many species we grow. The \nexpended aquarium water will grant them better quantities of this \nsubstance, and because nitrogen is used for chlorophyll development in \nleaves,  the plants will do much better had they gone without the nitrogen. \nRunoff will not be an issue because I will not produce nearly enough \nnitrogen to promote a nutrient surplus.\n\nEventually, however, the carp I own will turn over more plant matter than I \nam willing to grant them, and thus become a liability, leaving the largest \nindividuals next in line for my dinner table. \n\nAfter the fish is prepared, the scraps go into my compost heap to \ndecompose, and later can be added to the soil as an amendment that promotes \nmore balanced nutrient levels, extending biodiversity, disease resistance, \nlongevity, and better crop yields. All the while. plant waste from the \ngarden is also used to fertilize the pond, giving food to decomposes and \nkeeping the balance of nutrients from reaching deficits.

Still, that is up for question, because \nalthough we can eat just-laid fertile eggs, it is not particularly of my \ndesire.\n\nThe goats will likely be the same, and they will be able to consume a wider \naway of plant matter within my lawn of creeping red fescue mixed with other \nnatural species. Also, I am not looking to get every last drop of milk, so \nall I need to do is separate the doe and kid for the night as they sleep, \nmilk the mother first thing in the morning, and reunite the two before I \nlet them out for the day. I will get less than half the milk, but have no \ndesire nor need to separate them. Giving them free range also means they \nwill not get worms or other parasites as easily\n\nThe 5-10 grass carp would be he only non-arthropod animals I actually kill \nand eat. This Vietnamese species grow very large very quickly. At four feet \nand almost 90 pounds, each one would provide a suitable amount of frozen \nleftovers for months especially because I would not be eating it that fast; \nI guess you could call them seacows :D. Killing them will be done \npainlessly and without fear. As a fish keeper, clove oil is used to \neuthanize terminally ill individuals. When added to the water, the fish \ngets tired (fish do go into stasis during the night like humans) and dies \npeacefully in its sleep.",

Most parents love \n*all* their children, no matter how many they may be.\n\nYes, we can grow, and expect to be okay, well into the foreseeable future. \nThe world is nowhere near full of people. Sure, we may have lost a reason \nto grow, that of filling an \"empty\" world. But if so, what of the other 99 \ngreat reasons to grow?

But what could it be? Where can we put more billions of people? \nAha! There is a way. Put the additional people to come, where we always \nhave. In between all the people already living. There can simply come to be \nmore places with lots of people, and fewer places far from lots of people. \nWhat we need, is a human-denser planet.

I met a lady \nauthor who had 12 children, but did not meet her children. Those I have \nmet, had beautiful families. As a pro-lifer, I very much agree with people \nletting their babies push out just as fast as their bodies can grow them, \nbecause like huge numbers of people, I also have practical, philosophical, \nand religious objections to all methods of birth control. More and more \npeople would be glad to live. Every human life is of immense value and \nsacred. I am very much for proper development for the growing human \npopulations, but to try to \"control\" our numbers is counterproductive, \nbecause far more people benefit from human populations naturally and freely \ngrowing.\n\nNeo-Malthusian-ism is not realistic, for there are other population \ntheories out there, and sex means babies. It is how babies come to be \nconceived. We are the descendents of those who most successfully \nreproduced, so of course we should have powerful reproductive urges. Humans \nenjoy being constantly \"in heat,\" and we are not confined to a limited \n\"breeding season,\" which is one major reason why contraceptives are such \ncrap and unreliable. Many people actually mate daily, year-round, \nyear-after-year. Many people are okay with their fertility, and see no need \nto try to \"control\" it.\n\nThe problems you listed, are actually caused by corrupt governments and by \nthe mad-scientists that they employ. The same people who lie to us about \ntheir stupid \"overpopulation\" theories. GMO is not about feeding the world, \nbut rather, allowing giant corporations to monopoly our global food \nsecurity. Do some research into the relevant conspiracy theories, and learn \nwhat is really going on. The Bible warned of a great falling away from \nfaith. That and the rampant contraceptive pushing, why else is it that we \naren't so much having 9 and 10 children anymore?, yet many people are still \nhaving so many children, especially in populous places like India and \nAfrica.\n\nYes, there is supposed to be more children born than people die, what part \nof Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth, do you not understand? It \neven says to subdue the earth, further confirming that people are supposed \nto increasingly cover more and more of the land with people. People want to \nlive, not to die. I have no objection to world population wildly surging \npast 10 billion by 2025, but where did you get those lofty numbers? Do you \nmean perhaps by 2050? As I know of no projections that say by 2050. Maybe 8 \nbillion by then. Since the 4th billion, the world has added another billion \npeople, each 12 years, by official estimates, if those can even be trusted \nto be accurate? There are population undercounting theories that say that \nthey don't count tribal people who are not controlled by the NWO, and whose \nbirths are not officially recorded.\n\nThere is no oxygen shortage. In fact, most all shortages are phony, the \nnatural result of bad government policies, say like paying farmers to not \ngrow food? That human populations grow so much, shows that we *can* grow, \nand not that we can't or shouldn't.
