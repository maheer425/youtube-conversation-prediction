Crimes families \ncurrently operating in America, from east to west, are as follows: Bonanno, \nColombo, Gambino, Genovese, Lucchese, Magaddino, DeCavalcante, Bruno, \nBufalino, LaRocca, Patriarca, Colosimo, Zerilli, Civella, Giordano, \nPorrello, Baltistrieri, Trafficante, Marcello, Civello, Dragna, Cerrito, \nand Colacurcio. *There is no such thing as the Russian, Irish, Jewish, \nGreek, or Chinese mafia*. Because they are not Italian, the word Mafia to \ndescribe them is a misnomer. Rather, any organized crime outfit that is not \nItalian is called The Mob ... which also applies to Italians, who can be \nMafia, gangsters and mobsters, yet no other heritage can be Mafia. Frank \nLucas was a gangster; a high powered drug lord that ran a cartel ... much \nlike the fictional film character Tony Montana in Scarface. Lucas was not \nMafia, in which you must be Italian to be made ... otherwise you are merely \nan associate, and will remain one because you can go no further.\ufeff",
