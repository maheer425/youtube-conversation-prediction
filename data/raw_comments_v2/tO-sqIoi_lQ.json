For \nexample feminists have blocked or denied the need for facilities for male \nvictims.\n\nAlso feminists pass laws that legalise and encourage racism and sexist \ndiscrimination. For example in hiring practises, where laws compel you to \nhire an X percentage of women based on their gender and not on professional \nmerits. Germany even has a feminist law that formally bans men from being \nhired as top executives. If you hire the most competent CEO, and he's a \nman, your company will be fined heavily and his contract disbanded because \nhe's a man.\n\nFeminism also argues for persecution of different sexual minorities. The \nfeminist book 'Beauty and Mysoginy' for example writes that fashion is a \nconspiracy by gay men against women, who hate women because they fancy men. \nAnd feminist's hatred of people who practise BDSM is well-known. It's even \nto the point where women feel a need to write apologetic blogs about how \nthey're not totally inferior and supporting the fictional 'patriarchy' by \ntheir sexual orientation.\n\nAnd seeing as a woman being hired based on discrimination also isn't in a \nlegitimate position either, you could even argue feminism is against women. \nI don't know about you, but I would never want \"I'm only in this job \nbecause I have titties\" written on my resume.",

            "text": "+Blah b  What dictionary is that definition from? I was sure the common \ndefinition was simply \"child lover\".\n\nSo any child who has finished puberty is entitled to give their consent to \nan adult of any age? Are you aware some children don't experience puberty \nuntil their late teens while others (especially overweight young girls) \nbegin as early as 7 or 8 (reminder; this is kindergarten age)? What about \nchildren as young as 3 or 4 years who were sexually molested and now behave \nhyper-sexually and instigate sexual contact with other adults? Just because \nan under-developed and inherently naive brain wants it does that mean it \nshould be legal?\n\nOf course it doesn't.\n\nYou think I would destroy lives in support of what I deem appropriate age \nof consent laws, however I could argue you think it's fine to destroy lives \nof children by advocating social acceptance of consensual statutory rape \nand assault. There are still victims because children do and want things \nthey do not understand wholly as concepts nor their consequences good or \nbad, and that's what I'm concerned about. And why risk it? Why do you \ninsist on siding with an adult's desire to date a child over the child's \nrisk of being taken advantage of, especially when the adult need only wait \na few years, which is nothing if both parties truly loved each other for \nthe person they were. Although I cannot fathom why an adult would love a \nchild personality enough to not wait until that child was more of a \nrelatable and cognitively mature, I can assure you that's not why I'm \ndefending my opinion so fervently, at least consciously.\n\nI'm not conservative at all, by the way, I truly have disdain for \nvictim-less crimes and pervasive crimes concerning sex and sexuality in the \nUS (bestiality for one clearly shouldn't be illegal despite my distaste for \nsuch interests) but I cannot accept this as one, although I'm sure there \nare rare (keeping in mind that something rare would happen many times when \nwe're talking about a group of 7 billion) exceptions where everyone is \nhappy and the child isn't damaged.\n\nAnd that's why I don't think calling me \"entitled\" is the most appropriate \nword. I'm going to lay it all completely out for you; I am, in fact, \nentitled in a progressive society to tell a person he cannot physically, \nverbally, or mentally abuse another person, I am entitled to support taking \nreasonable measures and precautions to avoid such situations from \nhappening, the question is then, what percentage of these kind of \nrelationships would \"work out\" and end without damaging the child? I must \npersonally refute any claim that it is the majority based from my own \nknowledge in both criminal and adolescent neuropsychology, and that's why \nleaning on the safe side and choosing to protect the child from significant \nrisk over the adult's desire and intolerance to wait until the child is \nolder is so obviously more important, *especially* reflecting that the \nruling isn't permanent and in most cases the adult would only have to wait \na few years for his or her legal clearance (notably; after the risk of \nexploiting the youth is down to a more reasonable number, there is of \ncourse, risk in everything).\n\nThat's not unreasonable at all and is very clearly the safest route to \ntake. In addition, such a ruling prevents perverse and exploitative \npedophiles from having legal clearance to hurt a child and protects the \nchild if he or she was threatened or persuaded that he or she \"wanted it\", \nthis being a problem we already have and could easily anticipate to worsen \nif we favored the adult's desires over the child's safety.",

What's right isn't always legal, and what's legal \nisn't always right, but the legality is really beside the point, it's the \nreasoning behind the issue that really calls for reporting. Why is murder \nillegal and why do we report it? It hurts someone, yes? Homosexual \nrelationships, like inter-religious relationships, do not hurt anyone and \nlike I said earlier, happen between two consenting adults (and if you want \nto argue over what I consider an adult, I consider anyone who's is in their \nmid twenties an adult, as that is when the brain has almost entirely \nstopped maturing and one can make the best decisions. The reason I'm \ndefending an 18 year old is because I have experience as both a 16 year old \nand 18 year old, and the gap  of maturity between the two ages is of great, \ngreat value. Simply put, at 16 a girl is psychologically underdeveloped at \na level a 30 year old man should have no interest i beyond being perverse \nand interested in naive children, in a way, a slight pedophile-- \netymologically \"child lover\", because a 16 year old girl is irrevocably a \nchild in every way, and a child is by no ethical measure entitled to give \nromantic consent to an adult of a significantly higher age.)\n\nMight I ask why you're so insistent in defending the relationship between a \nyoung girl and a mature man? Do you take interest in minors or are you \nyoung and dating someone far older than you? I think not, you sound too \nold. Regardless, you sound like this is very personal, and that interests \nme. Perhaps you have a bias or conflict of interest? And more \ninterestingly, I am interested to know where you draw the line of \npedophilia.\n\nAnd cry oppression all you wish, it's only oppression if you can defend it \nas oppression, and I don't think you have any argument. You continue to \nentirely dodge the concept that a 16 year old is a child, and that a child \nof any age is easily taken advantage of by someone older, especially \nsomeone of 30 years, and that a power imbalance in a relationship can ruin \nthe girl forever, not to mention if he desires physical intimacy as an \nolder man, but she is too immature and yet feels pressured to reciprocate \nbecause of the power imbalance, which I think you're ashamedly \nunderestimating. The complete premise of the relationship, even if it was \nlegal, is setting the adult up with a highly inexperienced, immature, and \nvulnerable partner, while the child is with what they perceive as a \nvenerable, powerful, idol-like partner, these types of relationships often \nirreparably damage the younger partner emotionally and concerning their \noutlook on healthy relationships, do you not care? Surely you can identify \nsuch a view of each other isn't an indicator of a healthy relationship in \npeople of any age.\n\nI'm not saying in the history of humanity a healthy relationship of this \nkind hasn't existed, I am saying that would be the exception while the rule \nis that it is far better to be safe than sorry and wait until the younger \npartner has more life experience, has greater and stronger self-value and \nconfidence, and has the ability to make the best choices for him/her. *If \nthe older partner truly loved the younger partner for who they are and not \nfor their child-like mind and/or body, then he/she could wait until the \nyounger partner was more of a partner in life and less of a dependent, \nnaive, and submissive child, period.*",

Max sentence 12 \nyears in prison. The prosecution has instructions to drop all cases against \nminors (0-15 year old) except in exceptional circumstances. 16-18 year olds \ncan be convicted, but will probably receive a slap on the wrist at most \nunless actual sexual abuse is proven.\n\n12-16 years old, cases can be pursued by the parents, but if the other \npartner (the accused) is a minor there are instructions to not create a \ncase. If the partner is an adult 18-21 , a case can only become a court \ncase if abuse seems likely, meaning almost all such cases get dropped.\n\n16-18 year olds are considered capable of consent to relationships. It's \nextremely difficult to create a case out of that. You would need to make \nsexual abuse in the form of coercion or exploitation (dwang, uitbuiting of \nmanipulatie) likely. For example if the girl doesn't speak a word of Dutch, \nis from Russia and works as a prostitute, there would be a court case. But \nif she's happy with the way things are and there's no reason to assume the \npartner is manipulating her, no case will be created.\n\n\nLaws regarding 'Ontucht' come mainly from article 247 of the Criminal \nLawbook (wetboek van strafrecht).\nMost of the legal instructions are based on the \"Memorie van toelichting \nGoedkeuring verdag inzake de bescherming van kinderen tegen seksuele \nuitbuiting en seksueel misbruik\"",

It's not \nthat she's dumb, it's that mentally she doesn't probably doesn't have the \ncapacity to have any idea what it feels like to be him, and if she was 30 \nand he was 45 it would be a totally different story. 16 though... if he \nreally cares about her, he should know that she needs time to mature and \nfully grow into the person she is going to become as an adult, and he \nshould take a step back and wait several years (if not just for legal \nreasons). 16 year olds are still growing, I'm still growing, and the desire \nto date a 30 year old is unrelatable. I hope she ends up okay, and that he \nis a good guy, but odds are against that.",

            "text": "+2121princesse  Yup! That's why I said a relationship cannot occur \"even if \nthere is consent present.\" But you're right - in my opinion, I'd report it. \nThe reason I even gave the advice that considered the other option is \nbecause there are people all over the world here on Youtube so I don't know \nif it's the same for her (/if/ she's living in a different country). The \nreason I bring this up, is because if there is no law outlying this \nrelationship, then she won't get any support from legal authorities and she \nmight get backlash if it fails to be taken seriously. And I'm afraid I'm \nnot articulating myself so that I'm making it sound more intimidating that \nit actually is and I'll actually convince her not to report it :c But, \n(tl;dr:) I do think the best option would be to report it. Because, \nspeaking as a 16-year-old myself, her friend most likely does not know what \nshe wants in a relationship yet, much less with a 30-year-old man so I \nbelieve reporting the relationship would be in her best interest to do so!",

The \nbest examples that I can give would be with male rape victims. Lately there \nhas been a lot of female teachers, who for some reason prefer to have sex \nwith male students. I would read stories and I would often see comments by \ngrown men about how \"lucky\" the boy is & how they \"wish their teachers had \nbeen like that!\" Not only are these comments there but, at times they'll be \nthe most popular comments. \n\nLet's look at Debra Lafave's case. She was a 24 year old woman that had sex \nwith a 14 year old boy. Men said the boy was lucky. But if the genders were \nreversed would a 14 year old girl be lucky? Why is it that a 14 year old \nboy is lucky but, a 14 year old girl is a victim? Why is male virginity not \nas valued as female virginity? I feel there is a horrible double standard. \nCould it not be possible that a 14 year old girl is just as willing to have \nsex with her teacher as a 14 year old male? I believe we as a culture feel \nthat young girls couldn't want or enjoy sex as much as young boys. I know \nsome will feel 14 are too young to know better but, children aren't as \nstupid as most would like to believe. But the notion still stands at 15, \n16, 17 years old. A 17 year old girl caught having sex with her male \nteacher would get the same level of scrutiny.\n\nIf you read this far leave your opinion.

And, in my experience, the *majority* of sexual \nencounters in fanfic are not obviously consensual in the beginning but \nusually end in the couple riding happily away into the sunset after a love \nconfession. \n\nThis does appear to give the impression that 'no' does not actually mean \n'no' or at least, as Hank mentioned, that the absence of the woman saying \n'no' means 'yes'.\n\nI'm not pretending to be all 'holier-than-thou' in this, I personally \nprefer stories where there is some reluctance on the part of the woman. Not \nbecause they aren't attracted to the male character but because some \nemotional or situational hang-up gets in the way. Logically, I know that \n'no' should mean 'no', but I find a certain level of reluctance hot for \nsome reason. As, it seems, do most authors and readers. Why is this?\n\nIt's a bit different from video porn, I imagine, because with written porn \nis much more narrative and character-focused, by virtue of it being written \nfrom someones perspective and within the context of pre-existing complex \ncharacters. It's also written mostly by women, for women, from the \nperspective of women, which you would think has an effect as well...\n\nI don't know, any thoughts?\n\nAs a side note, I never read the more dark 'rape, humiliation and domestic \nabuse' stories (it's kind a sub-genre?), those just make me angry. If I do \nread them, it's more because I start them unwittingly and then desperately \nwant the female character to escape, kill the man or even just kill herself \nin the really disturbing ones. \n\nAnd to any non-fanfic readers out there, no, not all smutty fanfic is like \n50 Shades of Grey. I promise you, the realm of smutty fanfic on the \ninternet is the most diverse reservoir of pornographic material known to \nmankind.

I'd like to blame it on my \nhormones balancing out as I'm slowly transitioning into adulthood (stupid \nteenage hormones) and I have no doubt I'll grow mostly out of it (I say \nmostly because, c'mon guys, don't lie. You'll all still be reading yaoi and \nyuri later in life), but I also know it's a genuine growing curiosity in \nsex (even though I have a purity ring).\n\nHowever, going back to the question with \"no means no\", I'm personally \nannoyed by how people think it's a great idea to play \"hard to get\", \nespecially women. Taking into example, I was having a conversation with one \nof my closer friends on how to confess to my crush since I wimped out of \ndirectly telling him, and she suggested a note, or having someone else tell \nhim for me. I full refused to use a note because this emotion I'm feeling \nfor this boy could possibly develop into something greater (or not, we'll \nsee tomorrow if he returns my feelings) shouldn't be conveyed by writing it \nin 8 different languages, sent to him by Morse Code and sends him on a \nspirit journey to figure out what I said and have him completely \nmisunderstand everything because written words do that.\n\nI feel if people were more honest and open and didn't think some things \nwere taboo to talk about in public, I think our world would be better. Now, \nI will agree there are somethings I wouldn't want to talk about with you, \nlike religion and politics, but sex and consent really shouldn't be \nconsidered an awkward thing. I'm 15 years old, sure, I'll get a bit \nembarrassed by the word vagina and penis, but it won't stop me from openly \ndiscussing it with my future partner or close friends. A lot more birth's \nwould be controlled if teenagers talked before having sex with their \npartner instead of going straight at it and thinking they now how it all \nworks. These topics shouldn't be embarrassing, they should just be casual. \nNot like, \"Hey Dave, what's your favorite sex position?\", oh heck no, but \nmaybe more like, \"Hey Dave, I'm thinking about going farther with my \npartner, what do you suggest I do?\" and discuss it like adults, instead of \ncalling other people our \"conquests\" or \"oh man, she so wants me\". Guys, if \nyou're saying that to all your buddies, it's probably because you're \nfooling yourself into thinking you have a sex life.\n\nAlso, guys, don't go up to a girl and say, \"Nice shoes, wanna fuck?\" if you \nwant to get together with a girl. If a guy said that to me, even if I had a \nvery active sex life, I would slap him. And, when confessing to the person \nyou like, don't go overboard with romance and such. Just straight up tell \nthem. I would prefer for a guy to just sit down and talk to me. Say, \"I \nfind you very lovely, and I admire your personality. I like you, and if you \ndon't like me that's okay, I wouldn't want to jeopardize any friendship I \nhave with you, but I hope you like me too\". Same goes for you girls! Don't \nover complicate things! Over complicated things makes everything confusing \nand results in pain and sorrow! And if confessing to someone you don't know \nto well (like I am tomorrow. Eeek!), the same advice goes! Talk to them! \nDon't try to be evasive or sexy, it looks stupid and gets you no where! \nTell them, \"Hey, I believe I like you. And, I would love if you gave me a \nchance to get to know you so I can confirm these feelings. But, if you \ndon't feel the same way, I would still love to get to know you and become \nyour friend because you seem like a wonderful person.\". If a guy said that \nto me, I would (probably) fall in love with him.\n\nAnyways, this got horribly off topic, and I'm sorry you two if I said \nanything that offended you or in any way just annoyed you or didn't help at \nall ect., but I had to insert my two cents and observations on the wild and \ninfuriating species know as Adolescents.",

It's also very prominent in East \nAsian media.\n\nHaving said that, I think it is true that more sexual/romantic encounters \nin fiction are started and/or encouraged by women now than in the past, \nwhich is nice. \n\nI suspect you're creating a hard distinction between seduction and coercion \nwhen in practice it's more of a spectrum.

Especially when \nthey're teenagers. I think a lot of the romance of wooing a girl has gone \nout of style. So while being open about sexual activity, it's also created \nthe stigma that each sex is walking around \"wanting it\" all the time. While \nsome may not view their virginity as sacred or special, that doesn't mean \nthey shouldn't be respected.\n\nWith seduction there's attention to the mood, the other party's verbal and \nphysical responses. Generally, unless they're drugged or drunk, people give \nphysical responses to the situation. Little to no eye contact, arms crossed \nin front, legs tightened together, visibly shaking, frowning, and etc. Some \nmay argue that it's because they're nervous, but the act of seduction and \nromance is to make the other person feel comfortable and just as willing. \nThis is also why verbal communication is VERY important from either side. \nGuys asking girls, \"Are you sure? Are you okay? Do you want to stop?\" Many \nguys feel this is lame or let themselves get caught up in the moment, but \nit's needed. If the guy/girl seems hesitant, it's best to stop.

I don't like the idea of \nsomebody being unable to write a story in their head because they have to \nfret about how it might be construed.\n\nBut I do worry about the more subversive effect those kind of plots have. \nRomance novels often idolise women who 'play hard to get', this leads to a \nsituation where it's *expected* women say no and it's *expected* men grope \naround a bit until they change their mind.\n\nNot to make it the women's fault. But if fiction teaches females that \nthey're *supposed* to say no when they mean yes, otherwise they're a whore, \nthen where does that leave men? It creates a blurred line between a sincere \n'no' and a coy 'no', and not every man is going to be able to make the \ndistinction every time. \n\nIf this was about something that is very rare and near-universally frowned \nupon in real life, like necrophilia or pedophilia, then obviously I do \nbelieve people are perfectly capable of separating fiction from reality.\n\nBut it isn't. Women playing hard to get and men being insistent is normal, \nfan fiction just takes something many people do and takes it into more \nextreme sexual-assault territory. \n\nThat's not to say I actually know what I want to change about the \nsituation...I just want peoples opinions.

            "text": "+sumoni Here's an idea, maybe women could learn to actually take \nresponsibility for their own choices instead. If a man forces or threatens \na woman into unwanted sex, he's a rapist. Pure and simple. If a woman \nagrees to have sex with a man because she's too polite to say no, however, \nthen that is entirely on her.\nWe seem to be moving as a culture in the direction of holding men not just \nresponsible for their own sexual decisions, but for the sexual decisions of \nwomen as well. Over and over again, I hear women telling stories of \nregrettable experiences in which they reluctantly agreed to have sex with a \nman, not because they were being forced or threatened, but because they \ndidn't want to be rude, or because they didn't want to seem like a tease, \nor because they felt like they owed him for taking them out to dinner, or \nbecause they were worried he wouldn't be interested in hanging out with \nthem again if they said no, or because saying no would be too awkward, etc.\n\nIn the past these situations would have simply been regarded as the \nregrettable sexual experiences that they are, but increasingly the women \ninvolved are being encouraged to label these experiences rape. Situations \nin which the woman gave her consent, and in which the man did nothing to \nforce her, are increasingly being called rape because the woman involved \nwas too much of a people-pleaser to voice her own desires. As unfortunate \nas these situations may be, they are not rape. The crucial element in rape \nis the lack of control. The inability to stop what's happening or to decide \nwhether or not sex is going to occur.\n\nIn our culture we're all socialized to be accommodating and to consider it \nrude to deny someone, and yet most of us have no problem saying no to all \nkinds of things on a daily basis. If women are really so powerless in the \nface of men's desires, then clearly they have no business voting or serving \non corporate boards.\n\nAfter all, you just need to get a man to express an opinion to her and \nshe'll have no choice but to accommodate his desires. I see this phenonemen \nas an artifact of our increasingly childish and victimhood-obsessed \nculture. If you don't want to have sex, then don't. So long as no one is \nforcing you, saying no is always an option. Even if it can be a bit awkward \nat times. Once women learn to grow up and say \"yes\" when they mean yes, and \n\"no\" when they mean no, these regrettable encounters will stop happening. \nIt's not on men to police women's sexual decision making, and only women \ncan put a stop to these situations. Women are adults with the power and \nresponsibility to make their own life choices.",

That's the distinction I'm trying to make. If \nsomeone is constantly asking while the other says no. I agree, that's just \nannoying. Touching while the other person says no, is walking on thin ice \nand a shitty thing to do. If you're touching someone and they're saying no, \nthat shows your lack of respect and disregard to the situation. Anything \nmore than that, is crossing into rape. \n\nPeople give in for various reasons. Part of it has to do with survival \ninstincts that kick in when there's a perceived threat. Rape survivors have \nbeen known to freeze up, that doesn't mean they were asking for it or \nwanting it at all. They've also given in just to get out of their current \nsituation. They go into shock. The reasons these cases are so thoroughly \ndetailed is to find out if the victim was indeed put in a situation where \nthey felt they had no choice. There used to be a time when it was \nimpossible for a man to rape his wife, or for a woman to rape a man. \nFortunetly we're able to look at these situations to see if the person \naccused did use psychological means to intimidate.\n\nIf you're touching a girl and she's repeatedly telling you no. You can \nusually tell they're not into it. No eye contact or fear in eyes, legs \nclosed, no smiling, no physical response in turn. If a girl is just lying \nthere saying no and you decide to have sex with her anyways, you don't see \nanything wrong with that situation? You don't wonder why she's not kissing \nyou back, holding you, smiling, and just being unresponsive?\n\nIf say this were a woman groping a guy when he doesn't want to, it's still \nwrong. It doesn't just fall on one person alone. If the person I'm \nattempting to seduce is unresponsive to me, it doesn't hurt for me to ask, \n\"Are you into this? Is this okay? Do you like it?\" I, as many other women \nknow, men can get erections just from touching, but I'm not going to take \nthat as a form of consent if he's glaring at me. I'm certainly not going to \nuse fear tactics, emotional manipulation, and etc. to get sex from him.\n\nWe have those laws, yet when a teenagers come forward about being sexually \nassaulted, they're accused with should've being able to know better as \nwell. That they've been through sex education so they should be able to not \nbe taken advantage of by some 40 year old perv.",

If someone is \ntouching you and you make it very clear that you don't want to be touched, \nthen that's on them.

Most sexual abuse cases, the \nsurvivor had physically/verbally let the attacker know, they didn't want to \nhave sex. If the person pressuring turn to manipulation tactics, which they \nusually do, then it still becomes a form abuse. Because it's physiological \nmanipulation. People seem to be confusing it like asking mommy to buy a \ncandy bar until she gives in. It isn't the same thing. Not everyone views \nor experiences sex in an unemotional, detached way. If you pressured a girl \ninto having sex with you and afterwards she's crying. I would hope you \nwould understand you did a terrible thing forcing her to do something, you \nknew beforehand she didn't.\n\nThere's more to it than just the black and white view you have. If a woman \ndate rapes a guy by saying things like, \"Everyone will think you're gay. \nI'll tell everyone you're gay. You don't want everyone to think you're \ngay.\" After the guy repeatedly said no, then she's using a manipulation \ntactic to achieve sex despite his protests. She using what she feels he'll \nbe most afraid of against him. (Equivalent to a guy saying he'll beat the \nshit out of girl.) He didn't want to, but obviously she can't physically \nforce him, so she does that instead. It's still rape.\n\nIf the predator has no fault whatsoever, then what's the point in having \nstatutory rape or child molestation laws? A 30 year old can surely talk an \n11 year old into sex. So I guess it's the 11 year old's fault? There \nwhere's the line drawn? 9? 5? Before you say kids don't understand, well \nthese sickos say in their defense, they educate their victims about sex \nprior to committing acts so that the child, in their eyes, IS consenting \nsexually.
