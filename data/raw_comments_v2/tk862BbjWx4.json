            "text": "First of all, the answers to your questions will depend on what country the \nnew works are published/used/sold/exploited. Assuming you are talking about \nUS:\n1. Copyright protection is given to derivative works (this isn't a common \nthing in other jurisdictions) that protect against works based on the \noriginal work. This would prevent against new versions, whereas most other \njurisdictions would require someone to *copy* the original work, or a \nsubstantial part thereof, before infringement is found. Going from movie to \nbook versions, or the other way around is infringement, provided you are \nsubstantially copying the work. However, the one big defense is fair use, \nwhich is where certain versions, like fan fiction, will apply. Courts will \nlook at a variety of factors to determine whether something is fair use:\n   the purpose and character of your use,\n   the nature of the copyrighted work,\n   the amount and substantiality of the portion taken, and\n   the effect of the use upon the potential market.\n2. When the author is a person, not a corporation, that is when copyright \nis life plus a fixed term. Don't confuse \"author\" with \"copyright owner\"; \nthe author is the original owner, but they can sell the work later. If they \nsold it to a corporation, the corporation's copyright would last the \n*author's* life plus the fixed term. The life doesn't change based on who \nowns it.\nIf a corporation is the author, copyright protection will just be a fixed \nterm (there is no \"life\" protection given in the legislation in such \ncircumstances), so when the corporation dissolves is never an issue.\n3. Copyright in the original story of Peter Pan is now in the public \ndomain, so it is not protected by anyone. Anyone can copy the original \nstory. However, you cannot copy Disney's productions of the story, as I \ndon't think those are old enough to be in the public domain. That doesn't \nmean Disney owns the story, it means they have a more limited copyright \nprotection in the way they expressed the story, so that you would have to \nbasically copy exact clips from the movie to infringe. Likely the only \nreason why permission would have to have been gotten from Disney is on a \ntrademark basis (which is a completely different realm). Long story short, \nusing \"Peter Pan\" in the title may have confused people into thinking the \nlive production was made by Disney (or that they were involved somehow), \nwhich is what the trademark protection is related to.",

Like many other genres, you can take a story, change \nthe setting, and make it work as SF.  (For example, the SW4 work print used \nWW2 airplane battle footage as a placeholder for the attack on the Death \nStar.)\n\nI mentioned TV Tropes, which categorizes and analyzes how stories use \ncertain literary devices.\n\nHeck, if you want to be academic about it, try these:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(folkloristics) It's been going on for \nmillennia.  \n\nYeah, there's nothing \"new\" about anything.  \nJust new ways of mixing and matching stuff.\n\"It's [BLANK] meets [BLANK] by way of [BLANK]!\"\nor\n\"Hes [BLANK]. she's [BLANK].  They fight crime.\"\nor\n\"A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of \nsupernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive \nvictory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the \npower to bestow boons on his fellow man.\"\nor \n\"A community in a harmonious paradise is threatened by evil; normal \ninstitutions fail to contend with this threat; a selfless superhero emerges \nto renounce temptations and carry out the redemptive task; aided by fate, \nhis decisive victory restores the community to its paradisiacal condition; \nthe superhero then recedes into obscurity.\"\n\nAs for the corporations...  yes, BUT...\nThose creators who did not do Work For Hire can sue for termination of \ncopyright, which was written into the law in the 70s.  This is what \nhappened with the Kirby estate (which settled with Marvel), and what is now \nhitting the fan in the music industry.  (See: Prince/Warner Brothers \ncatalog, for example).\n\nIf the creator DID do work for hire...well, they should have read the \ncontract.  Some companies do offer creator credit, and television does \nallow creators to get rich.  \n\nPersonally, I prefer a much shorter period of copyright.  \nLife + 50 for an individual, 50 years for a corporate work.\n(If you think that is not long enough, realize that patents expire after 17 \nyears.)\nTrademarks are what corporations can use to protect their Intellectual \nProperty.  You could make a movie about Superman, but you couldn't use the \ntrademark.  ",

Or again, the Star Wars films (space opera is nothing new, Dune did it \nbetter), or the Walt Disney movies.\n\nAs for the estate benefiting, CGP raised the good point that everyone is \nignoring, which is publishing companies generally own more of the \ncopyright, or even all rights, than the actual authors themselves.
