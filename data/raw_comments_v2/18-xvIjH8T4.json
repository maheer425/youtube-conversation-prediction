The following problem is that these are \nawful pets - they're not simply not built to be domesticated house animals \nlike cats or what have you. A good number of them (in conditions like \nthese) die from malnutrition, disease, and other extraneous circumstances, \nrather than natural predation they face in the wild. The final note of \nconcern here is that these poor little guys are endangered because of human \ninterference; both in terms of habitat reduction and capture. The pet trade \nof the Slow Loris has had a huge number of effects on their poaching, \nmortality, and reproduction rates. If you like these little creatures - \ndon't buy one. There are reserves you can sponsor and number of other \nprotection alternatives you can fund where these sweet little things can \nenjoy space and live their lives in peace; free from this sort of direct \nhuman involvement and the subsequent problems that result from them being \nmade a \"pet\" oriented commodity.\ufeff",

Ad hominem arguments are unbecoming of you.\n\nAnd excuse me for not postings sources; I can't do much on a mobile phone, \nthanks. Why not use the amazing machine you have at your fingertips to do \nyour own research? Also, just because a video has a lot of positive \nfeedback doesn't make it GOOD or RIGHT.\n\nPlenty of people upvoted Nash Grier's videos; even supporting him when he \ncontinuously insulted trans/lgbt members. \n\nAnd another thing? I quite enjoy MLP, but bronies are the scum of the \nEarth. You've ruined a children's show with copious amounts of porn that \nmake searching unsafe. At least the Steven Universe fandom has the common \ncourtesy to tag all/most NSFW items as \"Stephen Galaxy\", so that the \nlikelihood of a child stumbling upon those images is unlikely. Also, \nconventions? Multiple harassment reports of all kinds have been filed \nagainst those who call themselves bronies against MINORS. ADULT MEN, \nSEXUALLY HARASSING LITTLE GIRLS who are just trying to enjoy a con \ndedicated to a show they enjoy. It's disgusting, and I immediately distrust \nanyone who labels themselves a brony.\n\nAlso, MS Paint series...? Wow. That's a bit rude, don't you think? Besides, \nMS Paint can be great. Guess you've never seen Homestuck.",
