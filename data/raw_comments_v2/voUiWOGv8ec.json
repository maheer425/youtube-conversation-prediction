Just curious because \nif after the production Prada and the others are granted ownership of the \ndesign patent, then what is stopping them from shifting gears and \nmanufacturing the product themselves?......... Currently trying to \nunderstand the full picture of intellectual property and found this \ninteresting, sorry if my question / facts/ or wording isn't 100% clear, \njust wanted some additional thoughts from peers.\ufeff",

The reason they would not \nwant to go into making their own eye wear is because they know what will \nhappen to them if they do (think about what happen to Oakley). Plus, Polo \nand Prada do not want to deal with buying material, hiring people, shipping \norders, customer service, finding a supplier and buyer, etc. so they just \nlet another company do all the tough work and all they do is collect the \nroyalties. Eye wear is just their secondary business, their real business \nwould be hand bags and clothing and even then they don't make it \nthemselves. Some times they just design it and outsource it for the same \nreason they outsource eye wear. Maximizing profits is corporate rule #1.",

When this segment first came out \nI was all for it, then I watched it. Needless to say I have never been more \ndisheartened then I have been. \n\nLuxottica may be big, but they are not a monopoly as this segment makes \nthem out to be. Yes they make, sell, and insure on a large volume, but it \nis not the whole market. At the moment their market share in SALES is about \n70-80%, while their total market share on brands is actually only about \n25%. That leaves 75% of brands that have nothing to do with Luxottica. \n\nThe key to finding these brands is walking into independent optical or \nsunglass stores. In my store alone we have 25 or 26 different lines with \nonly 7 of those coming from Luxottica. \n\nAs for the price of glasses there is a lot more that goes into glasses then \nwhat is suggested in this segment. Yes glasses can be made cheap, and for \nsome that will work. I would recommend youtubing how glasses are made. \nThere are a number of short videos that explain(in simple form) what is \ndone. On average though a high quality Zyl(acetate) frame requires \nsomewhere around 200 individual steps to make, and metal frames are a hair \nshy of almost 400! \n\nAs for the cost of lenses, the cost of materials is little IMO compared to \nthe cost of the machinery that is required to process the lenses. We work \nwith a lab that has millions of dollars invested in the equipment to \nproperly make a lens that best fits the clients needs.\n\nThen there is the optician. Schooling/training, knowledge base, and \nexperience to help someone find and make the right pair. This is a trade \nthat requires lots of hours of having ones nose in the books. I'll leave it \nat that.   \n\nI can go on for hours on this subject but I won't for time purposes. I will \nsay Andrea(sp) is no longer the head of Luxottica so win for those that are \nanti this company. I will also say people really should watch out for the \ninternet based companies that this video mentions. Some of them are no \nbetter then Luxottica when it comes to wanting your hard earned money. Do \nsome research.\ufeff",
