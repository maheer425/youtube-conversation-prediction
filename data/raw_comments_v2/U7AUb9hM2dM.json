The human brain receives enough pleasure by mental arousement and \nwith some amount of physical to go with the imagination and activates the \npleasurable contractions in a woman. Wether its clitoral, vaginal with \nclitoral indirect or not at all, or in rare cases anal, a massage, \nwhispering in her ear, or a dream she has, even child birth,etc... is \ninfintesmal, the only type is enough pleasure is received to activate the \ncontractions, that is all :) 2. A man and a woman's overall pleasure during \nsex and orgasm are about the same, just a man's is more concentrated. \nOverall higher in pleasure but for a shorter amount of time. It varies, but \nthe overall amount adds up. Further, multiple orgasms past a few are weak \nfor most after a while in both genders. 3. Should have mentioned this \nfirst, but the fact is most women actually don't masturbate that often in \ntheir lives, CERTAINLY WHEN COMPARED TO MALES lol There is nothing wrong \nwith this as a woman tends to be enlightened earlier on about the \nsignificance of seeking love and the responsibility of child caring that \ncan come from the act. Its there natural instinct to want a very specific \nidea in there mind and no matter how much they imagine physically or read \nmentally, a woman wants an actual existing man they understand and are with \nand accepted very much to be able to orgasm, and even then usually only \nwith that man. A man on the other hand is better off losing his virginity \nand being with a few women since he doesn't use them but for masturbation, \ncan't get pregnant, and it gets him beyond the novelty of sex towards an \nidea of making love. In other words=====Women can't detach themselves from \ntheir desire for love and there desire for sexual pleasure since its far \nmore intertwinnned earlier on for a woman, it takes us men longer to get to \nthat point and we are more naturally detached in that its far more \nimportant for a man to orgasm regularly too(generally, orgasms only keep a \nmale's fertility up, a woman doesn't get any real benefit physically one \nway or another ON AVERAGE, not always, but on average, as it only helps \nmentally).\ufeff",
