As for the boot, I'm hoping to win because I have wide feet and as \nyou can imagine in a game...It can end up hurting your feet with the wrong \ncleat on...I also like the fact that this isn't a high name brand and it \nwould be interesting to test the \"lower\" brand compared to the higher brand \nof cleats. The pricing is also very good so I would love to get these and \nsee if they hold up to their name.
