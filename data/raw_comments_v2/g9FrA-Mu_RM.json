I oppose federally run schools (we should \ntransition it with vouchers & school choice).  I tend to find TYT overly \nemotional and often very one-sided on a lot of issues, and they tend to \ndemonize Republican stances by cherry picking extremists (like religious \nnutts) or twisting things like \"oh you don't want men to be treated like \ngarbage, you must be anti-women\" etc.\n\nHowever, I am 100% on-board with legalizing marijuana.  I wouldn't use it, \nbut it's relatively harmless.  Treat marijuana problems as a public health \nissue (and maybe a potential social ill) - not as a criminal issue.  The \npolice state & the prison industrial complex does not solve all problems!\n\nTYT stop being so anti-Republic.  Let's get together based on specific \nissues (not party lines) and fight the police state.  We need good law \nenforcement who is accountable for their actions.  We need humane prison \nsystems that focus on rehabilitation and protecting us from people who are \nactually dangerous.  And we need to end the war on drugs - starting with \nthe complete legalization of marijuana.\n\nFinally let me add that the \"bust black kids\" garbage is leftist \npropaganda. Yes it's true that there may exist racism and injustice against \nblacks in the criminal justice system... But let's also not deny the simple \nfact that blacks do commit more crimes. Not all blacks, and this says \nnothing about any individual person who happens to be \"black\" (in fact, I'd \nargue that most of our common conception of \"race\" is based more on culture \nthan on biology). So TYT you can address the marijuana issue without \nspouting leftist propaganda and trying to turn everything into some kind of \nappeal to a demographic group like \"oh we want to help blacks because they \nare oppressed\". Guess what - non-\"black\" people (or people who are \npartially black) have their lives ruined by the drug war too! So don't sit \nover there and pretend like you have to be \"black\" to get your life ruined \nby the police state.\n\nIt breeds contempt for the law and disrespect for law enforcement - TYT you \nare absolutely right, and Miltion Friedman the great libertarian free \nmarket economist agrees. The way he put it was \"inimical to the moral \nfabric of society\". Milton Freedman gave the historical example of corn \nlaws in Great Britan causing an adverse effect on culture that caused more \ncrime and corruption. When the law is absurd, more people lose respect for \nthe law, and more people stray from being adult respectable responsible \nupright honest hard-working individuals, and some will even enter a life of \ncrime, and some they start a life of breaking only absurd laws but once \nthey are in that lifestyle they will break other laws too. It also makes \nthe USA government look bad to the USA public, and our credibility to other \ncountries.\ufeff",

Can't you see why it is \nwrong and immature to use drugs?? What parent would ever raise their kids \nto grow up and smoke POT? Didn't YOUR parents teach you any better than \nthis? Heck, my parents never even said anything to me about drugs and I \nsure never smoked pot. Nobody ever offered it to me or anything! And I was \na teen in the 70s! Same for my husband! And we sure don't know anybody NOW \nwho smokes pot, approves of it or knows where to find it!It is ILLEGAL! \nEven if it were legal, what a thing to do! People need to grow up and set \nan example and not use mind-altering drugs like marijuana or alcohol to get \nhigh, stoned, buzzed, relax, have \"fun\", enjoy life, celebrate, socialize, \netc. \n\nAND MUST YOU USE PROFANITY?? I have ranted against that for years online, \ntoo! Haven't you read a thing I have written? How can you be so crude??? \n\nTdot heisenberg\n \nOK cindybin smoking that mormon crack, your Mormon that explains why your \ncrazy and not all Mormons act like you , I know some great Mormon people \nwho don't do what your doing, I don't believe in religion I believe it's \nthe reason why they're is so much divide between people these days, anyway \nlet's get some shit straightened out here, you hate drugs because of your \nreligion right and don't tell me it has nothing to do with religion because \nyour god will hear you lying? Now I don't believe in religion so I don't \nhave to worry about burning in hell for getting high, also when you get \nreally sick where do you go? to the doctor for meds and what not, now when \nI'm in pain or i cant sleep I'll just smoke weed and I feel better,, what's \nthe difference??? now how bout someone who has cancer and they know they \nare going to die and they can't eat because of chemo, are we going to say \nno you can't smoke weed and get yourself a appetite so you can try to live \na normal life till you die, fuck that let them do what they want, if weed \nis so mind altering tell me how many overdoses have their been on weed? How \nmany people beat wives and kids high on weed? your arguments are useless \nwhen you have nothing to back them up, you and your husband must be cat \npeople or something, because what do you do with your spare time other than \npointless rebuttals people on YouTube , life is short, and if I want to do \nsomething that won't affect or hurt someone else , I'm going to fucking do \nit, guess what in Canada weed is decriminalized and I can smoke it whenever \nI want, it's a plant just like spinach or broccoli, and if you would do \nmore research you'd realise how amazing and life changing weed really is, \nPhoenix tears , research that and tell me why it's still illegal, it could \nsave lives and that's why the government doesn't want it to be legal, weed \nwould single handedly wipe out half the pharmaceutical drugs off the market \n, if your writing books try writing about pharmaceutical drugs, now those \nfucking dirty drugs are the real enemy and they are legal , go figure, \ngoodbye cat lady\n\ncindybin2001\n+Tdot heisenberg AARGGHHHH OH YOU PEOPLE ARE HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! Comments \nlike yours only make me angrier and MORE determined to speak up against \npot! I have said over and over how furious it makes me when you guys blame \nmy religion on my stance on drugs! I wasn't even religious in high school \nor college and I sure never smoked pot, and my husband is not Mormon and HE \nwouldn't smoke pot, and neither would anybody we know, religious or not! \nSTOP BLAMING MY RELIGION ON THIS! I don't say anything that any other \nparent wouldn't say! All I am saying is that we shouldn't use mind-altering \ndrugs to get high, stoned, buzzed, relax, have \"fun\", enjoy life, etc. This \nis good morals and just plain common sense! And pot is ILLEGAL! You can get \ninto big trouble if you get busted! Parents HAVE to tell their kids to obey \nthe law! CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?? What is WRONG with you people, putting me \ndown just for saying we shouldn't use drugs and that you can get into \ntrouble if you get busted???\n\nAnd you must be the 200th Internet person just this week to tell me that \nnobody has died or overdosed on \"weed\". I KNOW THAT! I KNOW THAT! I KNOW \nTHAT! The entire reason I have been forced to continue speaking up against \npot all these years is because of all you JERKS who always think that I am \nagainst pot because I think it's all dangerous and deadly and \"ruins your \nlife.\" NOBODY THINKS THAT! Doesn't it even OCCUR to you idiots that we are \nagainst pot because it's a mind-altering drug?? Pot smokers ADMIT to us all \nthe time online that they use it to get high, stoned, buzzed, relax, have \n\"fun\", etc. And that is why we are against it! That is what makes it wrong! \nWe shouldn't use mind-altering drugs for these reasons! This is good morals \nand just plain common sense! What parent would ever raise their kids to \ngrow up and smoke POT?? And I say the same things about alcohol! I rant \nagainst alcohol all the time, too--even more than pot! A casual booze \ndrinker is no better than a casual pot smoker, except they aren't breaking \nthe law! CAN'T YOU SEE MY POINT???\n\nAnd then you bring up MEDICAL MARIJUANA??? MEDICAL MARIJUANA? Oh you have \nreally done it now!! Oh this makes me FURIOUS when you mean guys bring up \nmedical marijuana!!! Have you not read a THING I have written over the \nyears?? I have said over and over that I am NOT AGAINST MEDICAL MARIJUANA! \nThat is a totally different issue! I am a nice person and of course would \nnot want someone to suffer! If marijuana truly helps someone with a true \nmedical condition, then of course that is a good thing! I would use it \nmyself if I had to, if it worked and were legal for that! I have been \ntrying for YEARS to write an article on the BENEFITS OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA! \nBut I have yet to find a single decent person to interview to use as an \nexample in my article! All the casual users rave about the medical benefits \nin order to justify getting  high, and even the \"medical\" users I've talked \nto and seen online have been horrible like the casual users, cussing me \nout, threatening me with death and bodily harm, attacking my religion, my \nlooks, my sex life, making mean videos and websites about me, making fun of \nme for collecting dolls, etc. etc. etc. I have collected THOUSANDS of \ncomments and emails from \"medical\" users, supporters and growers who are \njust HORRIBLE. Now all I want to do is write articles and make videos using \nthese comments, to show what people are like! Doctors, lawmakers and the \nentire public needs to know!\n\nIt is just SOOOO depressing. I always thought MEDICAL users would be nice, \nthat surely they would agree that we shouldn't use mind-altering drugs \nrecreationally. What parent would ever raise their kids to grow up and get \nhigh on pot? At any age? And we shouldn't use alcohol, either! I say the \nsame things against alcohol! Alcohol is a drug! Just because it's legal \ndoesn't make it right! Can't you see my point?? All I am saying is that we \nshouldn't use mind-altering drugs to get high, stoned, buzzed, relax, have \n\"fun\", enjoy life, celebrate, socialize, etc. This is good morals and just \nplain common sense!\n\nIf you told me NICELY that you are all about MEDICAL marijuana, I would \nhave gladly supported you and offered to interview you for the article I \nhave been TRYING to write on the benefits of MEDICAL MARIJUANA. But how can \nI support you after all you have said to me?? Now I have to add your \ncomments to my huge folder filled with all the other THOUSANDS of comments \nand emails from \"medical\" users, supporters and growers. It is just SOOO \ndepressing. I can't believe people are like this. Aren't there ANY nice, \ntrue medical users out there??\ufeff",

And now you're gonna tell me about \nall the moral pitfalls of being gay, I suppose.\n\nMs. Cindybin, there is nothing wrong with using mind altering substances. \n Since the beginning of time, man has always used substances to alter their \nmind.  Ancient civilizations even used mind altering substances as part of \ntheir religious rituals.  There is nothing wrong with taking your mind to \nanother reality.  As a matter of fact, it is healthy to take your mind away \nfrom the stress of everyday life.  Some do it with alcohol, some do it with \nsugar & sweets, some do it with a Fatburger.... I just happen to do it with \ndrugs.  It's all just the same.  Altering one's reality in a responsible \nway is not wrong or sinful; it is a natural state that man has always \nsought and always will seek.  That is why the war on drugs has been such a \ndisaster for America.\n\nSave yourself the effort and don't respond.  I'm done with you.  In all \nyour voluminous writing, you have yet to explain why you think drugs are \nwrong.  Other than to say people shouldn't be doing mind altering drugs, \nyou haven't given a valid reason as to why they are wrong, except that you \ngive your opinion as fact.  Just because you say it is wrong, does not make \nit wrong.  In order to convince somebody of your point, you have to give \nreasons that are more than just your opinion.  That is why with all your \nwriting, you still haven't convinced anyone of your argument.\n\nAnyway, I'm gone. Have a nice life.  Toodles.\n\nThat''s All.",

It's really not that \nhard to find a mental health counselor.  They have them at school \ndistricts, community colleges, and 4-year colleges, plus those who work \nindependently.  For someone who describes herself as an older woman, you \nseem out of touch with regard to finding a mental health counselor.  Heck, \nif you called the mental health department of your city, they would be able \nto put you in touch with a counselor.  It's really not that hard.  But I \ncan see that you are already trying to wiggle out of my proposition by \nmaking it sound like you don't know where to find a mental health counselor.\n\nAs for your other questions... I am 25 years old; my parents are at their \nhome (where else would they be);  they don't know that I'm specifically \n\"like this\" with you, but they do know that I have enough intelligence to \nquestion assertions when I disagree with them (like your assertions);  I \nhave smoked pot on a few occasions, but I didn't like the trip it took me \non.  I prefer to be up, rather than down.  So, I like crystal meth a lot \nmore because it makes me feel like I'm king of the world!  Plus, it's less \nexpensive than cocaine.\n\nAnd before you go on one of your rants about how drugs screw one up and \nthey are illegal, I'll have you know that I graduated summa cum laude from \none of the top 10 universities in the US and I have a MBA from one of the \ntop 5 business schools in the US.  So, drugs obviously haven't screwed me \nup.  As far as them being illegal, I don't care.  I know the risks.  I am \nsafe with my use so that I don't attract police attention.  And I'm \nresponsible for my own actions.  I don't tell others what to do with their \nlives and, conversely, I don't allow people to tell me what to do with my \nlife.\n\nIt is not for some meddling, doll-collecting, busy-body to tell me how to \nlive my life.  I know the risks all the way around and am willing to accept \nthem and, to date, my life has been spectacular.  So, stop trying to treat \nme and everyone else like you are their mother; you aren't.  My own mother \ndoesn't meddle as much as you do.  You are just a sad, mentally-touched \nwoman who has way too much time on her hands.  Get a grip.  Now I'm off to \nsmoke a bowl.\n\nThat's All.",

READ THE FOLLOWING:\n\nEddie Gluskin\n \n+cindybin2001 i don't think you realize how annoying you are.. you admit \nthat you don't know anything regarding weed, but that you think its \ndangerous and deadly and shouldn't be embraced as a recreational drug that \nis less harmful than beer. This annoys people, because thats a medieval \nstance in the modern world.. Weed is not lethal and it doesn't make your \nkids become dangerous addicts who kill for their fix. They don't get \nhemorrhages, psychosis or anything like that either.. so really, my \nquestion to you is: Why do you support prohibition of weed when you have no \nclue what you are talking about?\ufeff\n\n\ncindybin2001\n+Eddie Gluskin AARGGHHH Have you not read a thing I have written over the \nyears?? I have said a billion times over the past ten years that I haven't \nSEEN \"weed.\" That doesn't mean I don't KNOW anything about it! You don't \nhave to have seen or smoked pot to know what people use it for!!! \n\nAnd it makes me FURIOUS that you guys always accuse me of thinking that pot \nis dangerous and deadly, etc. NOBODY THINKS THAT! Doesn't it even OCCUR to \nyou that we are against it because it's a mind-altering drug??? I say the \nsame things against alcohol! I rant against alcohol all the time, too--even \nmore than pot! Haven't you read a THING I have written??\n\nOh this is just SOOOO FRUSTRATING. I type my fingers to the bone for YEARS, \nthinking you guys will finally understand, and you all still say the same \nthings over and over!!! I just want to scream!!! This is the entire reason \nI have to continue speaking up against pot, is because of comments like \nyours! You honestly expect me to say, \"Oh wow, you are right. I don't know \na THING about WEED, and I always thought it was dangerous and deadly and \nkilled people. But now I see your point that alcohol is the real killer! \nThat makes it okay to get high on POT!\"\n\nOh brother. YOU PEOPLE ARE DRIVING ME INSANE! I want my life back! I never \neven THOUGHT about pot before all this!!! But boy have you guys opened my \neyes! now I realize that we all need to speak up against pot and that it \nshould be illegal forever, with VERY STIFF PENALTIES! Not because of \nmarijuana itself, but because of the people who use and defend it! Like you!\n\nOh this makes me so mad. I type my fingers to the bone for TEN YEARS, \nwriting thousands of comments, tons of blogs, even a BOOK about why we \nshouldn't smoke pot or drink alcohol and how furious it makes us all when \nyou guys use the lame excuse that pot is safer than alcohol and when you \nall accuse us of being against pot because we think it's dangerous and \ndeadly and addictive!!! AND YET YOU ALL STILL SAY THE SAME THINGS! I wish I \ncould devote 24 hours a day to speaking up and EDUCATING you morons!! ",

Even after ALL I HAVE SAID to you, you \nwould still call me a \"troll\" and accuse me of having mental health issues? \nYOU ARE JUST HORRIBLE!!!!! I don't say anything that any other parent \nwouldn't say! What parent would ever raise their kids to grow up and get \nhigh on POT?? At any age?? Most parents try to teach their kids morals, \nvalues and common sense to know that this is wrong and just plain immature! \nAnd it is ILLEGAL! Parents HAVE to teach their kids to obey the law! No \nparent wants to bail their child out of jail and have them face a stern, \nharsh judge who treats them like dirt! No parent wants their child to lose \ntheir college scholarship or job opportunities! If you were a parent, you \nwould feel the same way! But even if pot were legal, I sure don't know ANY \nparents who would approve of drug us! And again, it IS a drug when you use \nit to get high and have \"fun\"! And we shouldn't use alcohol, either! I know \nmany of these same parents who would NEVER smoke pot because \"drugs are \nbad\" think nothing of using a mind-altering drug in the form of alcohol. \nBut they are hypocrites!\n\nOh this makes me so mad. I busted a gut to honestly and sincerely talk to \nyou, to HELP you, and you REJECTED it, and you still say that I am a \n\"troll\" with mental issues, etc. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU???\n\nAnd again, YOU are the one who thinks that people are against pot because \nthey think it's all dangerous and deadly and addictive. You told me about \nhow it's safer than alcohol and cigarettes, etc. We all have to EDUCATE you \nguys who think this! So many pot smokers think this! They just don't get \nit! It doesn't even occur to them that we are against pot because it's a \nMIND-ALTERING DRUG! Not because we think it's all dangerous and deadly and \naddictive!\n\nOh I just want to cry. I can't believe it. I busted a gut to honestly and \nsincerely talk to you, and you REJECTED it. You are just HORRIBLE. If you \nwere my son, I would ground you for life. \n\nGood luck trying to find a nice, decent young lady to date or marry. No \nNICE woman is ever going to want to date or marry a POT SMOKER. ",
