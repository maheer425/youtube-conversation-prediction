You cannot compare the force feeding of \nmost mammalian species to the force feeding of fowl, because most mammals \ndid not evolve to a) have no gag reflex (i.e. they puke) or b) to have \norgans developed to store large quantities of fat to survive long trek \nmigration. Ducks and geese on the other hand evolved to have these \ncharacteristics. Foie gras producers exploit these evolutionary \ncharacteristics to produce foie as well as geese meat. So it is no \ndifferent than, eating a steak which will come from a slaughter house.",
