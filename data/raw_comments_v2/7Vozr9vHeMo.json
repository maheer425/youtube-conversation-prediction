It may prevent the union of sperm and egg (fertilization). If \nfertilization does occur, Plan B may prevent a fertilized egg from \nattaching to the womb (implantation). If a fertilized egg is implanted \nprior to taking Plan B, Plan B will not work.\"\n\nIf a person believes that life begins at conception, and conception begins \nat fertilization, they would have concerns about using this method of \ncontraception.\ufeff",

It would be like me going to get my appendix \nremoved simply because it MIGHT become infected one day.\n\nThere is this common misconception that having a foreskin is the worst \nthing in the world because people think it causes so many problems. In \nreality, it doesn't. It doesn't cause any problem what-so-ever people say \nit does in order to rationalize committed an autrocity on a newborn infants \nbody.\n\nFor example the UTI argument, saying circumcision diminshes the chance of \ncontracting a UTI, this doesn't justify amputating a healthy part of their \nbody because they don't have a UTI when its performed, and even if they \ndid, the UTI was caused by a bacterial infection, not the presence of a \nforeskin. Female infants are 3x more likely to have a UTI infection, and \nguess what, you know how those UTI's are handled? They are treated with \nanti-biotics.\nAnti-biotics cure UTI not circumcision.\n\nSsame goes for all the other ridiculous claims of benefits, like the \nridiculous sexual disease \"benefits\" in no way does a newborn infant have a \nthreat of contracting any sexual disease even if it was remarkably \neffective (which it isnt) its questionable at best. But if we were to just \nassume it was true that circumcision reduced sexual disease risks by just \nsay 50% that still doesn't justify performing it on an infant. If a human \nbeing wants to remove part of their body that is THEIR decision when they \nare an adult to make.\n\nNot to mention condoms protect against ALL sexual disease to an efficiency \nof 99% no where close to the claimed benefits of circumcision. Making \ncircumcision redundant because you STILL HAVE to wear a condom.\n\nHIV rates are the highest in the United States where circumcision is one of \nthe highest rates of any first world country. So if it really had an impact \non HIV, it would be evident in the US. Studies show proper sexual education \nis what lowers sexual disease. That's what we should be teaching, not that \nwe can just mutilate a childs body. Its not your body, not your choice.
