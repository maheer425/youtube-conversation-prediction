That's true but misleading. Imagine a hypothetical situation in the \n1980s, fictional, for example, where two diplomats at the UN, one Russian \nand one American, were sleeping with the same secretary. So one walks in \none morning and finds the other in flagrento delecto, and shoots him. This \nleads to a diplomatic incident which escalates, until one side or the other \npush the button. Now explaining to the great grand kids in a century or \ntwo, that John shot Paul for shagging Alison, and that started WW3, doesn't \nreally make it understandable. You really have to explain the cold war and \nthe Mutually Assured Destruction concept.\n\nShooting Franz Ferdinand was the trigger, but what caused it was a hundred \nyear old game of Mutually Assured Destruction, where all states had \nmultiple treaties with others, to step in and help if anybody started \nanything shonky. This ... rat's nest of treaties, arose out of the \nNapoleonic Wars, where everybody had to work together to stop one man \nruling the world.\ufeff",

            "text": "+AccentedGamer Haha thanks. Well I can give you an example of how nations \nthought of others as lesser sure:\n\nRussia was seen by Germany and most of the other European Powers as \nbarbaric, backwards, and not up to par with the rest of the nations. This \nwas only slightly true. Russia was certainly less industrialized than say \nGermany but they were catching up fast (Finished the Trans-Siberian \nRailroad in 1916 for example). Germany wanted to become the powerhouse of \nEurope and the high German command saw a war with Russia in the near \nfuture. \n\nAustria-Hungary was a mixed bag. It was a very diverse state. Ethnic \nAustrians saw themselves as being the greatest especially when compared to \ntheir Slavic Balkan counterparts (Like the Serbians). Austria-Hungary \nthought that they would crush Serbia in the war and that there was no way \nSerbia could hold out against their great army. In actuality Serbia fought \noff against numerous attacks and it wasn't until Bulgaria, and Germany \nhelped out with yet another Serbia/Montenegro invasion that Serbia was \nwiped out. \n\nFrance and the United Kingdom had a longstanding rivalry. They, with \nRussia, were allies in the Triple Entente but this doesn't mean they really \nliked eachother. Actually researchers has found documents stating that the \ntwo had plans for invading one other before World War 1 began. England (UK, \nI'm just gonna refer to it as England cause it's easier) was only allied \nwith France, whom they didn't really like, and Russia their \"All time \nRival) because the German Navy was the only one strong enough to attack \nEngland.\n\nGermany was scene as savages in the Entente powers during war time. A lot \nof anti-German propaganda pictured the Germans as barbaric apes with simple \nminds. In actuality the Germans was a major cultural and economic \npowerhouse before World War 1. Something many of the other European powers \nstrongly admired.\n\nNationalism is a mixed idea. It can give people pride in ones country but \nit also makes countries see themselves as the ultimate country. No other \ncountry is worthy of being compared and that was no more evident than in \nthe years following World War 1.\n\nAs for specifically Franz Ferdinand's sense of Nationalistic pride I would \nsuggest reading a Biography on him as I don't know too much on his personal \nbeliefs as a whole.\n\nWhat I do know about Franz Ferdinand was that he was one of the few \nAustrian High Command that didn't want a war with Russia and was willing to \nprevent one at all costs. He knew that the Slavic pride between Russia and \nSerbia was strong. He still saw the Slavic people as backwards (Many people \ndid) but he knew that Austria would most likely be crushed in a war against \nRussia. ",

            "text": "There is without a doubt western bias present in this video, but i was \npleasently surprised how little it affected it. I mean sure, playing with \nwords always causes anger, same as missinterpetations, but i have to notice \na few huge gaps here.\nOne, the reason why Russia was ready to mobilize was not explained very \ngood, it's a bit more complicated than what was presented here.\nSecond, well mistakes related to Ferdinand being \"moderate\" and how he \nwould change something if he was alive. Even if we assume that's true, \naustria had many non-austrians under it's control, and they'd all want \ntheir own freedom when the Empire was weak.\nThird, the assasination itself. I have to note that i'm very pleasently \nsurprised they payed attention to the date on which Ferdinand came to \nSarajevo, which won't be found in almost all western \"explanations\" of this \nwar.\nFourth, the role of Germany was a bit minimized.\n\n-Yes, Russia was angry that they lost the war with Japan( which was by the \nway silently supported by GB, and they knew about it about a year before it \nstarted ), but they mostly lost the war because they weren't expecting it. \nThey fixed that here, they were ready before everyone else, so victory was \nassured.\nSecond, Russia and Serbia had a very, very close partnership especialy at \nthose times. Mobilization was also a way for Russia to warn Austria that \nthey won't sit and watch while they overrun Serbia.  Serbia most certainly \nshared the cnditions of Austrian ultimatum shortly after they recieved it. \nSupported by Russia, Serbia rejected one condition which would basicaly \ndeny their sovereginity( and therefore would be unacceptable to everyone ) \nat the same day Russia started rattling with weapons. That was done at the \nsame time for a reason.\n\n-Ferdinand was seen as a tyrant by the Serbs( i won't use the term \"Bosnian \nSerbs\" because the majority were Muslim and Orthodox Christian Serbs, dig \ninto the matter and see for yourself if you dissagree ). Serbian government \ndidn't support destabilization of the region. Serbia just had two balkan \nwars, it was exausted and didn't need another one, especialy with a country \nas big as Austria.\nBlack Hand was an organisation that could have possibly had ties with the \n\"Young Bosnia\" movement( which Gavrilo Princip who killed Ferdinand was \npart of ), but they were just an unofficial organisation that were fighting \nfor unification of all Serbs. Note that i didn't use the term \"expansion\", \nbecause it wasn't expansion, it was liberation.\n\n-There were two assasination attempts on Ferdinand, and the second one was \na success. Remember that he was next in line for the Austriah crown. \nKilling a successor of the throne would usualy spark an internal conflict, \nespecialy in the Austrian empire which had a lot of non-austrians and \nnon-hungarians within it's borders. Black Hand was possibly expecting \nAustrian empire to fall apart after Ferdinand, as the life of the current \nAustrian king was nearing it's end.\n\n-Germany had a much bigger role in the war. Not only because it gave a \n\"blank check\" to Austria and was the first to declare war to one empire, \nbut also because Vilhem wasn't very skilled. He fired Bismarck, which tried \nto keep the three big empires ( Germany, Austria and Russia ) on the same \nside to prevent major wars. Soon after, there was no one to take Bismarck's \nrole and his effort was all for nothing. That was probably the most \nimportant factor and a reason why the war went global and why it even \nstarted.\n\n\nThere are much more interasting details, but i tried to concentrate on the \nimportant ones.\ufeff",
