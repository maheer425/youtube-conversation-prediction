As a lot of people say, \nit's interesting to hear at last an outside opinion of our history. \nSpeaking about Mexico (and it might apply to other fellow countries), we do \nhave a common ennemy: the ruler, the boss, the White and handsome \nneighbour, the rich, etc.\nThat's why NARCO and crime is so succesful, it gives people the opportunity \nto revenge the fall of the Azteq Kingdom (I'm exagerating, I know). That's \nthe reason as well thar brothers hate each other, we are sometimes very \nhypocritical!!\n\nWhen the US had their civil war, Mexico had the chance to reconquer our \nterritory by war: Texas, California and New Mexico. In those years Mexico \nwas ocupied by France... Benito Juarez and company chose sovereignty (even \nthough we continue in poverty) against greatness by having a national \nAlliance with France: history would have changed!!!\ufeff",

The \nproblem with Latin America is that the fall of the Spanish Empire left most \nof the contries weak and vulnerable to stronger countries like the US.

They're not succesful because they're \nsatelite states of other powers and because they have a complete obsolete \ncentral system that is only benefitial to the government. Also, because \nthey went liberal after they left the Empire.

John did touch on one important topic: \n conflict in the marked social classes.   This conflict has existed, and it \nexists in Latin America, since the beginning of time.  The Spanish made \nthis worst by always looking down at the natives, and their descendants. \n In addition, one very important topic was completely missed:  The \ncontrolling influence that the Catholic Church had over the natives; on how \nthe rich Spanish or the higher classes used the Catholic Church to maintain \nthe Status Quo intact.  This was true, at least since 1490 until the 19th \ncentury.  Towards the end of the 20th century, the Catholic Church started \nto finally support the cause of the poor classes, and helped in the civil \nrevolutions in the different Latin American countries.   And one more \npoint: when the Spanis came to Latin America, they brought a mix of nobles \nand lower Spanish class people, including ex-convicts.  These all brought \nwith them a culture of getting rich quickly by stealing, raping, bribery, \nand extortion which, as a \"culture\" was passed on to most or all of the \nLatin American governments.  We still see this, even today.  For example, \nthe poor people have elected leftist governments such as the Sandinistas in \nNicaragua or the FMLN in El Salvador.  The guerrilla comandantes, now \nconverted into politicians, have quickly become the new thieves, the new \n\"ricos\", with big houses, owners of new businesses, cottages, beach houses, \nand servants.  Quickly, using people's money for their own interest, this \nnew way of life for them has become part of their own \"culture\".   What \nthey once critized and fought, is now their new way of life.  Learned from \nthe previous governments.   And that's what was inherited from the original \nSpaniards who came to America.\ufeff",

For one, foreign people fail to understand how much latin \namerican countries hate all of their neighbours. We're like pre-WW2 Europe \nin that sense. So that's one thing.\n\nSecondly, it gives out a lot of excuses about dictatorships when we haven't \nactually had that many or for that long in most cases. For most of our post \ncolonial history we've lived in democratic societies with lots of \nnationalism, more than in post WW2 europe that's for sure. Just come to \nChile during the 18th of september, I dare you to say we're not \nnationallists after that experience.\n\nFinally, the fact the colonial order is why we've been traditionally poor \nis very downplayed. In the case of hispanic america, the way spain rulled \nit's american holdings was in such a way that we had monopoly with Spain \nand we had no foundational structure here. So, basically, the reason europe \nand the US are rich and latin america is not is because the former \nterritories were created with everything they needed to exist. They had \nbanks, professionals like doctors and lawyers, industry... everything was \nalready going on when those states were created. In latin america, those \nfoundational stones had been purposefully removed and latin american \ncountries have had to build the foundations beneath the alrady contructed \nstates, putting us at a dissadvantage.\n\nThat's right about the whole social class separation, but the higher \nclasses do not relate to those from other latin american countries.

It is not a \nvalid point. If there is a historical drag that Latin America carries since \nits early days it is a vast majority of illiterate and culturally different \npopulation of natives.
