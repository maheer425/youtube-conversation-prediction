Of course there is gas released from fluids as vacuums \nare created and then exceed the tension of the liquid and surfaces etc. \n But why make it complicated?  It's just a vacuum forming by increasing \ndistance between surfaces and then releasing the vacuum resulting in a pop.\n\nTendon slap is different and occur exactly the same as snapping a finger. \n Tension is built as the tendon hangs on a pertuberance and then slaps onto \nthe tissue adjacent, just as your finger does when you snap it to the music.\n\nIt is unhealthy?  Well, chiropractors make a living at it daily and it \nworks well enough that people have been willing to pay money for hundreds \n(possibly thousands) of years to have it done.  Why?  Because it makes \nthings feel better!  Why else do people insist on making that noise? Why \nwould a piano player and others using their hands repetively keep doing \nthis?  Is there a possibility that it increases the lubrication between the \njoint surfaces by that vacuum pulling an additional thickness of fluid \nbetween the surfaces?  No one seems to want to pay for much research on \nthis, but you can bet people will go with the results that they feel.\ufeff",
