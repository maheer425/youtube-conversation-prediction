It is a British Company, as it \noperates all over Britain, but atleast you got the message I was trying to \nimply. The rest of the companies I was correct.  Accuracy International and \nWebley & Scott are local companies within England that are not operated \nanywhere else in the UK, thus should they be classified as \nproducing 'English Firearms' . The same for Rolls Royce, Jaguar, Land \nRover, Bentley, etc, etc. Those are 'English cars' as they are companies \nwithin England that are not produced anywhere else in the UK. They have \nnothing to do with Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland... and even though \nthe English Parliament was disbanded in 1707. It doesn't make the British \nParliament as mother of all Parliaments, as many people see to think of it \nthat way. And I do think it would be fair to change the name of the 'Bank \nof England' to the 'Bank of Britain or UK'. As it's the bank of the rest of \nthe UK as well. But my overall message, was to enlighten you a bit, if you \ndidn't already know, that so much of what is 'English' gets subsumed into \nwhat is 'British'.",

Does BAE \nSystems not build British ships for the Royal Navy on the Clyde with a fair \namount of local workers, and planes for the RAF flown by British pilots.Its \nseems strange in particular you want to attribute that company to be \nEnglish.By extension is it the English army or the English navy or the \nEnglish airforce? The company has decided to name itself \"British\" but you \nthink it is cultural oppression of the English? And how does this British \nstate carry out this oppression.You have about 90 % of the population.So it \nis yourselves oppressing yourselves.Or is it finally 300 years too late \nsuddenly getting it right,recognising the sovereign state is the UK of GB \nand NI and hence it should be primarily things are British unless there is \ngood reason to the contrary? It never happened till recently hence the \nreactionary clinging to the Scottish and Welsh (and Irish) identities from \nthe smaller nations.We seem to have done it too well for your liking!\n\n\nYou have a fair point about some other companies you listed. Companies \nproducing quintessentially local product should indeed be called English. \nIn the same way it is Scottish or Irish whisky companies it should be say \nEnglish Cider companies or Cornish pasty makers. The cars well arguable but \nyou have a point. In fairness there are companies that get called Scottish \nI would equally say were British and there is no reason to really do so.\n\n\nParliament. Yeah I would agree I think it is the English Parliament that is \nthe mother of all parliaments (but not the country) As in the 17th century \ninstitution. Bear in mind it disappeared in 1707.Do you have a problem with \nit being called British now when it has MPS from all the UK. Try watching \nthe Levenson clip when he called it the English Parliament to Alex \nSalmond.All too indicative of the real problem.Too many call things that \nare or should be considered British, English and not the other way \nround.After WW2 when the Bank of England was nationalised and became the UK \ncentral bank why was name not eg changed to the British Central Bank or \nBank of Britain? How often is the UK currency referred to as English pounds \nwhen that is not its official denomination? These are bigger and much \nimportant matters than some private companies that frankly I have never \nheard of being called exclusively British rather than as English.\n\n\nI do think England has suffered in a loss of cultural identity. You never \nhad to really stop acting it was just still all really England or it never \nreally mattered to far too many acting like it was. Understandable maybe \nbecause you the biggest and dominant partner. We could say you made little \nattempt to try. Now you do. But you need to find a new cultural identity it \nin a positive way that can sit in a new UK arrangement. Not what is being \noffered here.\n\n\nI",

Again it had nothing to do with English \npeople, but self-interested British monarchy and Scottish nobility. \n\nI did vote yes, but for political reasons - I am of the opinion that our \nSocial Policy would be better run as a smaller and more social-democratic \nparliament, and that this requires independent tax raising etc. \n\nSome unfortunately cling to bigotry and identity - I do understand being \nproud to be Scottish but that shouldn't extent to hatred of the English (I \nhave always felt British). \n\nIt was a very long time ago yes, but the retaining of traditions, culture, \npolitical control over education and law etc, and even to an extent \nlanguage has meant the feeling that Scotland should stand on its own has \ncontinued. The union was exactly that - a union. Scotland and England \nstayed as their own entities. The invasion of Wales and the turning it into \na part of England has still meant their identity is somewhat less profound. \n\nAs Joseph points out, the differing of political traditions has led to a \nconservatism being seen as an English ideal (mainly down to Thatcher I \nwould say (and the same reason the North of England and Wales have disdain \nfor the South East)). Also with the rightward movement of Labour, the SNP \nare now seen to represent the Social Democratic traditions of Scotland \n(which really aren't as profound or different to that many in England have \nto be honest). \n\nThese divisions - cultural and political- have been stoked by the \ndevolution of powers to Scotland, a Scottish Government who tries its best \nto exaggerate and do things differently to England, and a feeling that \ntheir policies have been successful. The modern approach to politics in \nScotland has also led to some disdain towards the old-fashioned practices \nof Westminster. \n\nBoth Scotland and England have aided and taken from one and other many \ntimes over the long and interesting history of Britain. To me, any hatred \nof England or the English is ignorant. If independence is really wanted, it \nshould be on the basis of wanting to be self-sufficient, a feeling that it \nwould benefit us, or politics based. Identity of course can play a role in \nthis, but to hate people from, or to hate a country is bad. \n\nImportantly I will say that the majority in Scotland do not have disdain \nfor England.

England was also much better organised, as it was \nruled by the Normans and Romans for a good amount of time- Scotland, being \ncolder, more rugged and without any particularly fascinating resources, \nremained unconquered by the Romans and so was far less organised than their \nneighbours to the south.

Also some rulers of Wales were kings, but because of the \nseparate kingdoms in Wales when they were all conquered or united the ruler \nusually had the title 'Prince of Wales' instead of 'King'. This is why the \nheir to the throne today always has the same title, because when Edward 1 \nconquered Wales (thus ending it's independence) and he declared that \nEngland would always respect Wales' separate history and culture, so he \ncarried on the tradition and said that the heir to the throne would always \nbe called 'The Prince of Wales'. Sometimes the Welsh were classed as rebels \nwas because of their constant rebellions and uprisings against English \nrule, this was obviously after Wales had been conquered.

Canada was French and india was in the hand of Mughal empire \nthat was crushed by the British. China had Constant civil wars for \ndomination of the land that was all separate and not 1like today. The \nmiddle east was gained after ww1 taken from the Ottoman empire as well as \ntaking African colonies from Germany.
