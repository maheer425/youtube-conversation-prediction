This was the period immediately following the American Civil War, \nwhich lasted from 1861 to 1865.\"\n\nIn terms of national GDP most historians agree the US over took the British \nEmpire by the 1890s.\n\nBy the onset of WW2 it wasnt even close. The US was definitely the richest \nand overall the most technologically advanced nation.\n\n\"it was the 17th strongest nation. After WW2, it became numero uno.\"\n\nThis is a ridiculous assertion. No country goes from 17th to number 1.\n\nName the 16 stronger nations?\n\nThe US had a very large population in WW2\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1940_United_States_Census\n\n\"1940 United States Census. The Sixteenth United States Census, conducted \nby the Census Bureau, determined the resident population of the United \nStates to be 132,164,569, an increase of 7.3 percent over the 1930 \npopulation of 123,202,624 persons.\"\n\nIn contrast Great Britain had about 40 million people.\n\nThe US combined the most industrialized nation on earth\nThe largest single economy.\nA world leader in science and technology\nAnd the 3rd largest population on earth\nAfter india and china\n\nIn what universe was the US the 17th strongest nation. I say this as a \nCanadian.\n\nI would argue the clearly the US was the strongest single nation pre WW2.\n\nYou are referring to the size of the US army pre WW2, which is not \nreflective of the US's war making capacity.\n\nhttp://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/jun/13/ken-paxton/us-army-was-smaller-army-portugal-world-war-ii/\n\n\"To our inquiry, Paxton consultant Anthony Holm pointed out a historian\u2019s \nJuly 22, 2010, article on President Franklin Roosevelt and Great Britain in \nWW II. David Woolner wrote that in June 1939, which was three months before \nEngland declared war on Germany, \"the roughly 180,000-man U.S. Army ranked \n19th in the world--smaller than Portugal\u2019s!\"\"\n\nTotal enlistment in the US army was small because the US did not want a \nlarge standing army. At any time the US could conscript huge amounts of \nsoldiers (worlds 3rd largest population) and equip them really well. \n(largest economy and technologically advanced\n\nIt should be noted that the US Navy was the largest and most advanced Pre \nWW2. largest amount of heavy carriers.",
