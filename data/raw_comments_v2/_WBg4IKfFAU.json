I did not go through the public \nschool system, so I do not know if you will hear of them or not. If you \never hear of Java man, at one point he was a famous ape-man, there is not \nenough evidence to support him. If the two bones that constitute Java man \nhad been discovered today, the facts around his discovery would have \ndisqualified from science. The man who discovered him was actually off cite \nthe whole time having someone else work the dig for him. He was not \nqualified for the job at the time and afterwards, on multiple occasions, \nchanged the facts surrounding Java man's discovery. Another thing, if you \never see Ernst Haeckel's embryo drawings, don't believe them. Back in the \n1800's his embryo drawings were shown to be a fraud, but they were being \nused as evidence for evolution 20 years ago and they still might be, even \nthough they are false. The last point I would like to make is to not \nbelieve in the Miller experiment. The atmosphere he used to create amino \nacids is not longer considered by evolutionary scientist to be the early \natmosphere of the earth. If he had used the atmosphere that they no \nconsider it to have been, his experiment would have created formaldehyde \nand cyanide. Both of those chemicals are highly toxic. I would also \nrecommend you read Lee Strobel's book, The Case for a Creator. He grew up \nin a Christian family, but at a young age, turned to evolution and atheism \n(the literal definition of atheist is \"without god\" and is used to refer to \npeople who do not believe there is a god). Years later he became a \njournalist and editor of the Chicago Tribune. Then his wife became a \nChristian and he decided to put God and evolution on trial and set up \ninterviews some prominent scientist and prominent Bible scholars and in the \nend decided that the evidence was in favor of Christianity. To use a quote \non the back of The Case for a Creator, \"My road to atheism was paved by \nscience . . . but, ironically, so was my later journey to God.\" He has \nwritten several books on his journey from evolution to Christianity. When \nhe wrote The Case for a Creator, he was giving the same story as he had in \nprevious books, only he updated the science in it to that of modern day. \nThe copyright on it is 2004. I would recommend you read it, I have only \nread two or three chapters, and already I like it.\n\nI will not proceed to drop the topic.",

There is no evidence the bible is false; you just \nchoose to think so. \n\nHow does Hod break the laws of physics? Proof of a creator is everywhere. \nThe fact that matter and energy exist proves God. The reason God doesn't \nfly down and say \"here I am\" is because he doesn't have to. He already did. \nThrough science we see him, but also through the bible. Even if more proof \ncame, I bet you would still find a way to dismiss it. It's not a lack of \nevidence, but a lack of responding to it.\n\nOn religion, there is a difference between religion and true biblical \nChristianity. The latter is a relationship, not an order. Look at the bible \ncompared to other religions it is the only one to:\n\nA. Not require good works for salvation.\n\nB. Not have errors and contradictions.\n\nC.

I can't argue the accuracy of the dating, but it's the \nbest we have. If you didn't notice it said to give or take 0.05 billion \nyears. This is a pretty good guess. Now, the accuracy of your dating is not \nvery accurate. Your basis is a metaphysical being that we have no proof of \nexisting and the idea of it likely came from a human mind trying to explain \nwhat he doesn't know, and now is causing conflict with things we do know. \nYou only could know of this belief in two ways:\n\n\n1. The not very accurate method of passing things down via speech,\n\n\n2. or a mistranslated many times over book (since it was first translated \nway before we had good translations) that was also likely from a delusional \nmind.\n\n\nMmmm, yeah, some serious credibility there. I was raised in a christian \nhousehold, I'm not even in my teens but I have enough sense to find this \nsilly. I doubt I can convince you otherwise, but you at least have to \naccept that God's explanations aren't very accurate.

            "text": "+Ben Nett Let me point out that both of the dating methods you mentioned \nmay or may not be true. The first dating method you mentioned is based off \nof the assumption that the big bang took place. Basically, if everything \nstarted at a central point and you know the rate of expansion, \nacceleration, and current distance, then you can calculate the age. If the \nbig bang did not take place and God created the universe, then it would no \nlonger be a valid way of dating.\nThe second method you mentioned, relies on two isotopes. If you know the \nrate of decay of an isotope, then you can date something based off of the \nratio between it and the isotope it decays into. However it can be thrown \noff. If the conditions are right, isotopes can leech into the object being \ndated from the environment. The reverse can also happen where isotopes can \nleech out of the object being dated into the surrounding environment. \nDepending on which happens, it will make the object come out younger or \nolder than it actually is. There is also no way of knowing if leeching \noccurred other than using other dating methods and comparing dates. But \nwhat if leeching also occurred with them? There would be no way of knowing \nwhich one had the correct date, or if they all are wrong. There is also \nanother source of possible error. If God created the universe as recorded \nin Genesis, then He could have created the object with a preexisting ratio \nbetween the two isotopes. If that happened, it could throw off the date \nsignificantly.\nThose billion year dates are based on assumptions and beliefs and may or \nmay not be true. The date I mentioned of the earth and universe being 6,000 \nto 10,000 years old is based off of my religion which is also a belief. The \nreason I believe that my younger date is the true one is because I believe \nthe God of the Bible exists and I look around me and see proof of that (I \neven know someone that was miraculously healed).",
