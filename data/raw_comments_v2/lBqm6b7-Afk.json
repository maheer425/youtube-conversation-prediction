All the plushies and goodies are an okay price for what \nthey're worth, for a normal size maybe like 25 dollars, I prefer going to \nPacific mall for those kinds of things.\n\n For Just you too Sarah and tom, they have scarfs, jewelry and those \naccessories if I am correct. The jewellery is pretty nice and cute and the \nprices aren't too high either.\n\nFor Jong Ro, I wouldn't recommend buying things from there. They have kpop \nCDs',  merch and stationary here and there. But damn are they overpriced \nlol. what you would normally get for $20 they sell like $5-10 more \nexpensive. \n\nBut if you like cute stationaries then definitely check out Hipen, they \nhave pens, jewellery, bags, water bottles and etc. I think they have \nreasonable pricing.",
