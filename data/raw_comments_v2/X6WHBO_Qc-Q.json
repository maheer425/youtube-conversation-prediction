            "text": "I cannot believe that people, both black & white (other ethnic people \ntaking potshots also) - are actually considering Robert Downey Jr. a \n'racist'\n for playing the absurdity of an Australian Actor playing an \nAfrican-American soldier for the sole reason of demonstrating the \nridiculousness that the movie successfully portrayed; it was a movie that \npushed buttons in hilarious ways, from Ben Stiller's character playing \n'Simple Jack', and constantly talking in terms of \nmoron/retard/imbecilic/etc. to Robert Downey playing an Australian actor \nhired to play a black soldier in such a silly, innocuous fashion, and may I \nadd - in the funniest shit I've seen displayed. The 'real' black guy plays \na closet homosexual, Jack Black plays the white-trash 'heroin addicted \njunkie', and so forth.\nThe movie was meant to illustrate all those elements and controversial \naspects of the actors beyond the characters who are all on their last limb \nstanding and attempting to save their careers in the most absurd ways as \ndemonstrations of impressive performances. It is a terrific comedy, one of \nmy favorites, and for those who can only concentrate on Robert Downey Jr. \nas playing a 'black African-American soldier', who is in the script of the \nmovie is an Australian, Blonde haired/blue-eyed Australian, and actually \nconsiders the move racist or Robert Downey Jr. 'racist', is more ludicrous \nand insane than the movie's comedic portrayal itself. How sensitive do we \nhave to be to certain groups? You telling me that HORRID movie 'White \nChicks', where a couple of black actors (barely) play two white females \nwith extensive, and unconvincing - TRULY unconvincing - make-up and \nprosthetics & who acted like 'typical stupid white girls', right? \nYet Robert Downey Jr. is a racist, where these two horrible actors are were \nunassailable... why? Because whites can 'only be racist' is the sad \nmisinformation of the nature of racist individuals and the generalization \nof racism in groups.\nIf the movie is racist, then it's also insensitive to the 'mentally \nchallenged', it is insensitive to those suffering from 'substance abuse', \nit is insensitive to 'homophobia', it is a travesty to all morality... LOL. \nYeah, thank God I am not a thin-skinned white person, living in Toronto, in \na predominantly black area, I let racist 'white boy', 'cracker', 'ghost', \n'powder boy' etc. comments bounce right off my back - thank God, because I \nhave met four extremely wonderful people that have become fast-friends, an \nAlgerian, Jamaican, and two South Americans, and they are cool, open, \nintelligent, and yes my two South African friends laughed their asses off \nduring 'Tropical Thunder'. They are understand what is comedy and what is \naggressive authentic racism.\nAnyway, for those who cannot comprehend the difference between \nhyperbolic-exaggerative comedy and truly real 'racist' motivation - then \nyou people (black & white & everything between) are very clueless and \naimlessly lash-out in living in a constructed reality of being permanently \noffended by every single aspect in every single situation without the \nintellectualism to determine what is sincerely a 'threat or clear insult to \na certain ethnicity or colour or skin' or what is an exaggeration into the \ncomedic world which should be taken as a 'foolish, hilarious, & unserious' \nforay into comedy.\nEducate yourself, all of you, before deciding that Robert Downey Jr. is \n'racist' - more idiotic than anything I have heard in a very long time - or \nif his 'scripted character' is a racist intent by the 'movie production \nitself'; equally in stupidity. It is actually scary that certain black \nfriends of the U.S.A. and Canada can construe this movie, this Robert \nDowney Jr. character inclusion, as 'irrefutable racism'. It is actually a \nsad comment - not towards the movie, or Robert Downey Jr., but is a sad \nstatement about many thin-skinned people in the black communities across \nthe U.S. & Canada, & potentially some pockets around the world.\n*Tropical Thunder* is a brilliantly funny movie, both hilarious and \naction-packed, both confusingly subtle and outrageous & detailed to the \ncore of the characters they developed for this movie production. 'Race' (as \nthere is no 'race' in the human race because it is simply genetically, \nfactually properly named the 'Human Race') does not even spark a thought of \nracism in my mind, nor arises any offending nature from my closest South \nAfrican dark-coloured skin friends - because they find humour rather than \noffending wisps of racial discrepancies. Then again they are intelligent \nand 'get' the movie. More that can be said for some of you thin-skinned \npermanently offended silly fools!\nGreat, hilarious performance, Robert Downey Jr. It was the *Best Part Of \nThis Movie*! ; ) \ufeff",
