Yes. Are we getting hosed on the cost by socialized \nmedicine in other countries. Yes. Can those costs be reduced with the \napplication of logical thought. Most certainly yes. \n\nBefore someone attacks me for the comment on U.S. drug companies getting \nhosed on the price of drugs they sell overseas, I'll explain. Countries \nlike Britain and Canada dictate to a drug company what they are willing to \npay and in most cases the company is willing to take the hit and jack up \nthe price on U.S. sales. \n\nWhy not just tell the other countries to pay a higher price or kick rocks? \nThe answer is something called \"patent busting\".\n\nIf a drug company with a U.S. patent charges more than another country is \nwilling to pay for a new drug (or an older one that's still under patent) \nthere are a number of other countries with no compunction about violating \nU.S. patent law who will allow their own chemical companies to read the \nU.S. patent and use it as a set of instructions on how to make the same \ndrug. Since the foreign company has none of the overhead in terms of R&D, \npotential legal fees for rare or invented side effects or clinical trial \ncosts, which add up to billions, they can significantly undercut the U.S. \ncompany in all international sales.\n\nTherefore the U.S. company makes the choice to make significantly less \nmoney on sales to many foreign countries and cover their losses/placate \nshareholders on the backs of U.S. citizens. \n\nIt's not just U.S. companies that do this, European drug companies do the \nexact same thing for the same reason.\ufeff",

There will always be indigent people and stupid people. \nHanding those people an insurance card doesn't change the costs they run \nup, it just causes others to pay for it. \n\nThis is a sticky problem, one that I have no idea how to fix. What I do \nknow is that a standardized insurance form, tort reform, a regulatory \nframework that makes a modicum of sense and a streamlined FDA approval \nprocess that adds a *bulletproof* lawsuit shield to drug companies would \nrapidly cut costs by close to half. \n\nThis is something where you're talking about people on the margins, and a \nwhole heck of a lot of people would fall into the margin of being able to \nafford insurance on their own if you cut the price by 25-40% or more.\n\nIf we could drastically reduce the overhead for doctors and hospitals as \nwell as drug companies many things would become affordable.\n\nRemove the stupid regs and you can negotiate again, the way people did 50 \nyears ago.

That means reducing the overhead cost to the people that provide \nthe care. That means getting the current government system and lawyers out \nof the freaking way. \n\nThe ACA in no way does that. It doesn't reduce overhead, it doesn't \nincrease \"portability\" (which, in my mind was a bullshit argument from the \njump but that's another discussion). \n\nWhat the ACA does is take an extremely inefficient system that lacks price \nincentives for... well, anything and changes who pays the bills. That's all \nit does.\n\nOn top of that, since a lot of hospitals and doctors are not going to honor \nyour lower tier ACA compliant plans, if you have one you're just as screwed \nwith them as without them except you have to pay the premiums for a product \nthat does absolutely nothing for you.

            "text": "+Alex Harrison That's not entirely true.\n\nIt depends on how you weight things when determining a \"good outcome\". The \nstudies done by the WHO and other international groups have all weighted \nthe \"free public\" part of healthcare as the most important. \n\nThat's how Columbia came out higher in the rankings than the U.S., which is \ntotal bull. No one from the U.S. is going to Columbia for life saving \nsurgeries, however rich Colombians routinely come to the U.S. for something \nlike a heart bypass (the same is true of Canadians who have the means). \nThat wouldn't be happening if Columbia really had \"better outcomes\". \n\nAlso, you can't do an apples to apples comparison between \"public\" health \ncare in other countries and \"private\" care in the U.S.\n\nFirst, there is no way you're going to convince anyone who really pays \nattention that they have a better chance of beating cancer in any EU or \nCommonwealth country than they do at John's Hopkins or one of the Cancer \nCenters of America hospitals. Sorry, but the U.S. has the vast majority of \nelite hospitals for surgery and oncology. I'm not saying that other \ncountries don't have GOOD health care systems, but the statistics are not \nin your favor for many ailments. Just check the publication \"Health \nAffairs\" for an example (http://www.healthaffairs.org/press/2012_04_10.php). \nThe facts are the U.S. is better at treating something like cancer. Yes, \nit's more expensive, but if it's *your life*, you're getting what you pay \nfor.\n\nSecond, State governments in the U.S. are a major part of this problem. \nEach State has set up it's own insurance board which sets the rules for \nwhat is allowed in the State. This means that unlike automotive insurance, \nwhich you can easily buy online and is valid in any state, many plans \navailable in one State are not available in another. Simply put, you \ngenerally can't buy health insurance across State lines where you can with \nautomotive, home, renters, fire or any other insurance. \n\nThis regulation has led to massive amounts of paperwork being generated for \n\"compliance\". If you pick up the phone directory for a large hospital in \nthe U.S. you will find that a huge amount, as much as 40% in some cases, is \ndedicated to \"Administrative\" folks. These people are nothing but paper \npushers who's jobs exist solely to satisfy legally required \"compliance\" \npaperwork in most cases. They all get a good salary and benefits that have \nto be paid, massively increasing the overhead cost of the hospital.\n\nThen there's federal insurance regulations as well as the FDA and another \nhalf dozen alphabet soup federal and State agencies. All told a huge \npercentage of the money that is spent on healthcare in the U.S. goes to \nadministrative costs that shouldn't exist. \n\nThat's where most of that 6% GDP you're talking about goes to. Not HMO or \nInsurance company CEO's or profits. \n\n\"Let's not even get into the fact that an HMO is designed to provide as \nlittle care as possible to you.\"\n\nThat is simply not true and not even possible. The HMO/insurance company \ndoesn't choose what care you get, you and your doctor make that decision. \nThe HMO/insurance company decides what they're willing to pay and what \nthey're willing to pay for. You already got the care. \n\nThen there's another problem unique the the U.S. our batshit crazy tort law \nsystem. This is where you can sue for anything and even if your lawsuit \nfails because it's obviously frivolous, you owe nothing to the people you \nsued. They're left with massive court costs to defend themselves against \nyour slander. \n\nThis creates a system where doctors, especially anesthesiologists and \nOBGYN's carry *massive* \"malpractice insurance\" policies to cover them \nagainst lawsuits from stupid people being egged on by money hungry lawyers \nurging the filing of lawsuits for no reason. There are literally \nanesthesiologists who are making $700,000 a year and paying $500,000 of \nthat in malpractice insurance premiums.  \n\nThis means that you can take the number of patients this guy sees in a \nyear, and divide $500,000 by that number to arrive at just PART of the \ndoc's overhead costs of seeing you. He increases what he charges you by \nthat amount. \n\nSo if I see a doctor, any doctor, he's carrying this type of insurance (by \nlaw usually) and he's charging me for the premium he has to pay. My \ninsurance company is paying his. Peter is being robbed to pay Paul. \n\nAnother instance of Paul getting money right out of Peter's pocket is \npharmaceuticals. Many countries these days have relatively advanced \nchemical industries, which means they have a pharmaceutical company over a \nbarrel. \n\nA U.S. company does business with NHS in Britain or Canada and the NHS \nlowballs the company on the price they're willing to pay for medications. \nThe company has no choice because if they try to charge the real value of \nthe drugs the government of the other country will simply allow their \nchemical companies to make the same drug very much cheaper and then buy it \nfrom them. This is called \"patent busting\". \n\nA company creates a compound and gets it through FDA trials as well as the \ncomparable EU or other trials at a cost of $1 Billion +. So they have \nmassive overhead. They file a patent which must describe the compound and \nhow to make it. This information is publicly available. If the company \ntries to charge fair market value to say the NHS in Britain, another \ncompany in India, which has no overhead, looks up how to make the drug, \nmakes it and sells it to the NHS (this has actually happened in the past). \nThe company that spent tons of money on making the drug now gets nothing \nfrom the NHS, who are buying the cut price drugs from a \"patent buster\" in \nanother country. \n\nSo the drug company figures they'll make $0.65 cents on the dollar from the \nNHS, then make up the difference by jacking up the price in the U.S., which \nis exactly what they do.

In Australia, if a patient isn't either admitted to the ward or \ndischarged safely home four hours after arriving, the hospital has \n\"failed\".

Yes, bleeding can be a bother, I've waited in the EA (emergency and \naccidents) for about an hour with both my knees sliced open,  and the \ndoctors did provide me with a cloth to stop the bleeding until they had \ntime to sort it out. And I didn't die. It took some time, but that's life.\n3. Yeah, I'm sure that you \"actually work for a living\", but guess what: \nEvery job is equally as important. Right? The world needs farmers to \nproduce food, teachers to educate people and rocket scientists to bring the \nworld forward, but there wouldn't be a scientist without the teacher, and \nthe teacher wouldn't be there without food.

Those are available to everyone \nwho is on the NHS (National Health Service, our public healthcare in the \nUK). Source: \nhttp://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/vaccination-schedule-age-checklist.aspx\n\nAdditionally, people in risk groups can also receive heptitis B, \ntuberculosis and chickenpox vaccinations, and those travelling abroad can \nreceive (also for free) heptitis A, typhoid and cholera vaccines, and a few \nothers are only done privately.\n\nMost of the vaccines mentioned provide, after taking all the doses, near \nenough 100% immunity and many of them are permanent though some may require \nboosters or, in the case of influenza, the rate of mutation is too fast and \nnew strains develop yearly. Many drugs and antibiotics manage to treat the \ncause effectively, and not just keep the symptoms at bay; I can't begin to \nmention all the names. The problem is, every time you wipe out a harmful \nbacterial colony, you exert a selective pressure that favors resistance \ngenes, so mutant bacteria that develop antibiotic resistance may survive \nand then your cure no longer works. In addition to all this, many diseases \nare also caused your body doing something wrong, and this is at the level \nof the infrastructure, cell to cell signalling or a cell's regulation, \nwhich means that your options to correct it are limited: you either replace \nthe tissue/organ entirely with expensive and potentially dangerous surgery, \nyou give someone a drug that needs to be taken regularly to correct cell \nfunction, or you use transgenic technology (which we have not yet developed \nto this level) to correct the issue at its core.\n\nApologies for the long answer, I've tried to simplify the explanation and \nI'm sure I've left out so much information.",

Several years ago I started getting these three \nprescriptions filled in Canada for about $200 per month.  Every six months \nor so I would drive to Windsor, ON, visit a walk-in clinic, and get a \nCanadian prescription (about $35 for the exam).  My costs dropped from \nabout $7200 per year to about $2470.  I would plan multi-purpose trips, so \ntravel costs were negligible.\n\nAdditional savings could be achieved by using a mail-order Canadian \npharmacy; however, you have to be very careful with mail-order drugs.  The \nonly thing Canadian about many of the \"Canadian pharmacy\" websites is the \nURL.  Many of them are run by the Russian Mafia, so you may get nothing, or \nyou may get counterfeit drugs.\n\nSome Canadian walk-in clinics do not accept US patients, so it pays to call \nahead.  My shortest wait at a clinic was about 10 minutes; the longest \nabout 2 hours.\ufeff",
