Math Utility is a 4 day old account, primarily focused on \ndelivering our viewers with a easy to understand, less than 2 minute video \nabout topics in Geometry and Algebra I that could be very hard to \nunderstand. \n\nIf you ever need any help, or know of someone that does, PLEASE send them \nover to our page, not only for our sake, but for theirs too! They will gain \na quick understanding of the topic in the video, and will go into that test \nor homework assignment a lot more confident in their ability. Come check us \nout, and refer us to your friends!\n\nWe take ANY recommendations on math based videos, and will do our absolute \nbest to have those videos uploaded within 2 days!\n\nThank You and Have a Fantastic Day,\nYour Math Utility Team\ufeff",
