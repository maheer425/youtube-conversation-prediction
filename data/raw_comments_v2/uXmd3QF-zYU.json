You are probably \nlooking at a 2-3 year old test from Motor Trend if you are saying the \nnumbers I quoted are wrong. What Car and Driver and Edmunds have tested is \nthe last generation Golf R, which had much less power, weighed more, \nhandled worse, and was just plain much slower than the new 2015 Golf R. You \ntell me that I am quoting unrealistic times, but the very video that you \nare commenting on here (done by Motor Trend) as well as the link to the \nMotor Trend comparison test article, are actual numbers from actual tests \non the 2015 Golf R. They are real world numbers, not a pie in the sky \nguess, they are actual performance numbers achieved by testing the car. I \nwill hit the drag strip in the next couple months, and I should be very \nclose to what Motor Trend achieved in this video, which is a very low 13 \nsecond quarter mile. That is what people who have actually drag raced the \ncars have actually achieved. With launch control and the DSG transmission \nanyone can get these times accelerating from a new Golf R because it's as \neasy as setting launch control, flooring the gas and letting off the brake. \n\nSorry for the name calling, but seriously if you are going to comment on a \nvideo, at least watch the video and listen to what it says before spouting \noff inaccurate information. This is on the Motor Trend channel, it is their \nofficial test of the 2015 Golf R, and they went 0-60 in 4.5 seconds and \n13.1@104.8mph in the quarter mile. Please look at the link in my last post \nand actually read it. That is where Motor Trend compared it to the Subaru \nSTI and it gives the full performance break down on what the 2015 Golf R \ncan do. Eventually Edmunds and Car and Driver will test the 2015 Golf R and \nthere will be more performance data on the 2015 Golf R, but for now Motor \nTrend is all we have to go on for actual performance data. It has been \nfrustrating to me that you have been unable to process the information in \nthis video and Motor Trend's article, with you quoting performance times \nbased on a Golf R that stopped production 2 years ago that had vastly worse \nperformance than the new one. If you can't at least watch the video I guess \nI'll just refrain from responding to you because you would have to be a \ntroll to comment on this video saying that the testing that Motor Trend did \nin the video is invalid because you think your 200S should perform closer \nto the new Golf R. Have a good day, sorry for the name calling, please \nactually watch and process the information in this video and the article \nthat I linked. ",
