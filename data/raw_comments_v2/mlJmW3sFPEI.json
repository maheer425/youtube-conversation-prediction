However \nas history has shown us time and again every empire will eventually fall, I \nam sure it will take hundreds of years or an entire republican election \nsweep to bring our country down but it can happen. Hitler showed us all \nwhat can happen when he rolled across Europe taking every country he wanted \nand the same thing could happen in this day and time. He didn't invade \nSwitzerland though did he? It is better to have your citizens armed to help \nthe military defend. Besides guns do not make violence they are just a tool \nthat can be used for violence. There are several ways to drop the gun \nmurder rate like ending the war on drugs among other things. Not only would \nwe save a fortune by just letting clinics dispense drugs for free in a safe \nenvironment but there would no longer be a need for drug related violence. \nAlso the more we educate our poor and less privileged the less likely they \nwould turn to a violent lifestyle. I cant believe that people have not put \nit together that the war on drugs brought with it war on the streets but as \nusual most people try to fix something the wrong way. If our government \nreally keeps our best interests at heart and looks out for the people over \nwall street and corporations then people wouldn't be as angry or as \ndesperate. I really wish my fellow democrats would stop blaming the gun \nwhen it is the heart of man that is the real culprit.\ufeff",

By international law, that does count as piratery. \nCountries only have control over the 12 mile zone, which for the US, \ndefinitely does not extent until Cuba's 12 mile zone.

Because \nthe US is breaking INTERNATIONAL laws so often. It is the FOREIGN policy \nthat is so heavily critical in the US. Add to that the immense power of the \nUS and therefore the shock that comes, when we see some of the political \nactivity from other countries.\nIf countries like Russia, China, etc. would interfere with foreign policies \nand ignore INTERNATIONAL laws the way the US did, the US would probably \ncall for war within the NATO nations.\nI do not want to generalize here. All countries have their issues and all \ncountries have ignorant citizens. What makes the US stand out is that these \nissues are taking place in the most powerful country of the world, that \nthese issues are taken into other countries far too often, that hypocrisy \nseems to occur far too often and that even with all these problems, there \nare seemingly more citizens trying to justify these problems and even \ntaking pride in them than in any other country.",

            "text": "+yakumo961\n  I personally think everyone should be just as proud of their own country \nas Americans are of ours. Some things I would take issue with you however \nare;\n  No nation on Earth gets judged as much as the U.S.. Chinese and Russian \ngovernments simply don't care what their citizens and the world thinks of \nthem, because the people running them will never face negative \nconsequences. U.S. politicians are often arrested and / or voted out office \nfor poor judgements, even when they affect nobody but the politicians \nthemselves.\n  Both China and Russia interfere with, bribe and out right take over other \nnations without the slightest repercussions from their own people or the \nrest of world.  Every single U.S. politician, from local officials to the \nPresident, are judged on a worldwide stage. Something that would be \nunthinkable in most other countries.\n  Do we feel pride in our country? Yes. Is it irrational? Not in the \nslightest. We enjoy a standard of living that the vast majority of other \ncountries in the world can't compete with. There is a reason people flock \nto the U.S., because opportunities exist here like no other nation in the \nworld. Our taxes and regulations, however odious, are actually quite \nreasonable compared to that of most other countries. We give, not loan, \nmore in foreign aid than other countries, even with respect to per capita \nspending. We, as citizens, win hands down as the largest charitable givers \nin the world.\n  Do we have problems? Of coarse we do. We put in our nose in where we \ndon't belong, far too often. We have serious issues with our prison system, \nrace relations, education, money in politics and list goes on and on. But \nwe can discuss and debate them openly and without fear.\n  If you want a stark comparison try this; Go to Washington D.C. and yell \ninsults, true or not about President Obama, right out the White house. Then \ngo to either Beijing or Moscow and yell insults at their leaders right \noutside their offices (not even at their homes). Then when and if you get \nout of prison let me know how that worked out for you.\n  In Chernobyl, right now, the sarcophagus covering the damaged nuclear \nfacility is on the verge of collapse. The project to build a new cover has \nbeen delayed by another year and has run out of money ... again. The \nincredibly sad part of the story is that the entire project costs less than \none billion dollars. The U.S. government spends more money than that on ink \npens and toilet paper each year. The nations that would be the most \naffected, if the sarcophagus collapsed, can't raise the money to complete \nthe repairs. And have now turned to the G-8 for money, with expectation \nthat the U.S. is supposed to bail them out. Again.\n  Yes the U.S. has problems, and anyone in the U.S. is free to leave \nanytime, any day if they don't like it here.\n  Please don't mistake my honesty in facing our issues for being apologetic \nin slightest. Not one single nation in the world was built with clean hands \nand not one was created without bloodshed and oppression. The difference is \nthis; in the U.S. we try to address our problems instead of ignoring them.",
