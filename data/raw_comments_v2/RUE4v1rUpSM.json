Hitler seems to have been cloned \nbecause closed and #corrupt minds flourish. The #system of justice is \ncrumbling and no rescuers in sight ?? The Merchant of Venice comes to my \nmind.\nPortia's Speech from the Merchant of Venice:\nThe quality of mercy is not strained.\nIt droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\nUpon the place beneath. It is twice blessed:\nIt blesseth him that gives and him that takes.\n'Tis mightiest in the mightiest. It becomes\nThe thron\u00e8d monarch better than his crown.\nHis scepter shows the force of temporal power,\nThe attribute to awe and majesty\nWherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings,\nBut mercy is above this sceptered sway.\nIt is enthron\u00e8d in the hearts of kings.\nIt is an attribute to God himself.\nAnd earthly power doth then show likest God\u2019s\nWhen mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,\nThough justice be thy plea, consider this\u2014\nThat in the course of justice none of us\nShould see salvation. We do pray for mercy,\nAnd that same prayer doth teach us all to render\nThe deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much\nTo mitigate the justice of thy plea,\nWhich if thou follow, this strict court of Venice\nMust needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.\ufeff",
