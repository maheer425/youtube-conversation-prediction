Mostly movies, songs and music tends to play. \nAdmittedly, if I can't sleep and I FEEL that I am not getting sleepy, it \nnaturally keeps playing. BUT, when I do being to fall asleep, I can tell \ninstantly - my brain begins jumping from one music or movie track after \nanother, unable to lock onto anything specific. Then mostly I just go \nthinking \"Wait, what is going on?\" I check time... \"1-8 hours since I had \nthat last stray thought.\"\n\nI do not exercise that much, but I've had this issue for as long as I can \nremember - SINCE I WAS ABOUT THREE TO FOUR YEARS OLD.\n\nI guess I have randomized, minor depression here and there, but it lasts \nfor maybe minutes-hours, then it is gone.\nI often wake up too early, and I always check time when I go to bed. \nWithout feeling I am falling asleep, I check it again, about 1 hour later \nentirely by impulse/instinct.\n\nAlso, when I do wake up, I almost always feel tired, so I doubt I am \ngetting the sleep I really need at all.
