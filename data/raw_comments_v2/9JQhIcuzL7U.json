Seriously, why can't people see \nthat there are more upsides to cars than there are downsides? First off, \nwhat's done is done. We've got pollution, and we're stuck with it. Plus, \nit's no were near being entirely the automobile's fault. Even if we did \nmanage to get rid of all cars, we'd still be producing millions of \nproducts, causing pollution. War wouldn't go away either. We've had war \nsince ancient times, long before the automobile was even considered being \nmade. War is horrid these days, thanks to our governments and their stupid \nnuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons because of cars? I don't think so. Without \ncars, we'd also be more prone to threats, such as robbers. Cars have doors \nyou can lock, bicycles don't have doors. Life would also be more difficult \nfor banks and museums. No cars means no armored vehicles, making it more \nrisky to transport valuables. It would also take absolutely forever to \nreceive packages. We couldn't exactly make buildings in cities closer \ntogether either. Especially big cities such as NYC. Try moving a bunch of \nskyscrapers closer together. Even if we could do this, our cities would \nbecome more congested, thanks to less space. And to finish off, all the \nwork we've done to innovate cars to make them safer and more efficient \nwould be completely lost. Years and years of hard work from engineers would \nbe totally wasted.
