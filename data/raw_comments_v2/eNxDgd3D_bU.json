In addition to the vertical path, the \nresistive network can also have horizontal components so there are billions \nof three dimensional paths through the volume of the atmosphere.\n\nIn accordance with Ohm's Law, the resistance of the three dimensional paths \nis extremely low and a very large leakage current (electrons) can flow \nbetween the ground and the cloud.\n\nThe leakage current over a large area of the ground can dissipate some of \nthe charge. However the problem with applying the dissipation theory to \nlightning rods is that the small area of the rods are miniscule compared \nwith the total area of the ground. Therefore, leakage path through the rods \nthemselves can not conduct enough electrons to equalize the rate of charge \nbuild up due to convection in the storm. \n\nExperiments with laser ionization of the atmosphere below a storm indicate \nthat creating a few highly conductive leakage paths are also insufficient \nto prevent a lightning discharge. In all cases, the convection in a \nthunderstorm is so great that the charge between the cloud and the ground \ncan build up much faster than it can be dissipated by leakage through any \npractical means.\n\nInevitably, the potential will reach a threshold sufficient to cause an \navalanche of electrons and create a lightning discharge. The paths can also \ntake a different share of the current and that's why a lightning discharge \ncan have very erratic and spectacular shapes. \n\nIn summary, experiments prove that lightning rods alone cannot provide a \nsufficient path to dissipate any significant amount of the charge in a \nthunderstorm and a lightning strike will be inevitable. The main objective \nof lightning rods is to provide a safe path for the high voltage and \ncurrent around a vulnerable object.   \n  ",

[sarcasm])* So, like a bunch of numb-nuts, we'd be \nout in this large field, looking up at the clouds, jumping up and down.

            "text": "Links:\n\na. *MinuteEarth*: How to Survive a Lightning Strike\n\nb. *Lightning Strike*: Lightning strikes can produce severe injuries, and \nhave a mortality rate of between 10% and 30%, with up to 80% of survivors \nsustaining long-term injuries. These severe injuries are not usually caused \nby thermal burns, since the current is too brief to greatly heat up \ntissues[citation needed]; instead, nerves and muscles may be directly \ndamaged by the high voltage producing holes in their cell membranes, a \nprocess called electroporation.\n\nIn a direct strike, the electrical currents in the flash channel pass \ndirectly through the victim. The relatively high voltage drop around poorer \nelectrical conductors (such as a human being), causes the surrounding air \nto ionize and break down, and the external flashover diverts most of the \nmain discharge current so that it passes \"around\" the body, reducing injury.\n\nMetallic objects in contact with the skin may \"concentrate\" the lightning's \nenergy, given it is a better natural conductor and the preferred pathway, \nresulting in more serious injuries, such as burns from molten or \nevaporating metal. At least two cases have been reported where a strike \nvictim wearing an iPod suffered more serious injuries as a result.\n\nHowever, during a flash, the transient stroke current flowing through the \nchannel and around the body will generate large electromagnetic fields and \nEMPs, which may induce electrical transients (surges) within the nervous \nsystem or pacemaker of the heart, upsetting normal operations. This effect \nmight explain the cases where cardiac arrest or seizures followed a \nlightning strike that produced no external injuries. It may also point to \nthe victim not being directly struck at all, but being very close to the \nstrike termination.\n\nAnother effect of lightning on bystanders is to their hearing. The \nresulting shock wave of thunder can damage the ears. Also, electrical \ninterference to telephones or headphones may result in damaging acoustic \nnoise. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_strike",
