I think it's worth sharing what I \nwrote with others outside of the youtube conversation to see what others \nthink about life and our existence as a species on this planet, what I \nwrote is further down on this post:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2apGYUX7Q0&google_comment_id=z130gzbiilncv1v0f23pz1yo3qn2t1f0k\n\n#Life   #existence   #humanity   #science   #religion  \n\nHere's what I wrote in reply:\nWell, not reading the comments and just your reply first, I'd like to point \nout that you're making a statement which assumes absolute qualifies. Which \nto be proven wrong only one instance contrary needs to be presented. And I \npresent to you a minority of practitioners such as non-violent Monks. Which \nnow makes your statement invalid in logic. Our species perhaps could evolve \nto co-harmonize with each other and, in my opinion nearly equally as \nimportant, with our planet and the millions of other species... but that \ntype of adaptation is not likely to happen without necessity as necessity \nto survive in environment/ecosystem seems to be the driving force behind \nevolution. However, since we can abstract in our minds the potentials of \noutcomes it is perhaps probable that we can evolve as a species to avoid \nthe most detrimental outcomes for our species and other species. \nUnfortunately, it is my current observation that our system of life \ninvolves consuming of other life in order to sustain our own. Unfortunately \nit seems we can not be healthy by only eating inanimate objects such as \nsterile dirt. Our body seems to need the complex proteins and nutrients \nthat life creates. If life exists as we abstract in our minds... in \ngenerality (everyone may have their own perceptions of what life is and of \nexistence) ... then perhaps life itself could be unsustainable. Which begs \nthe question in my mind... beyond just a why or who.. but more basically \nhow are we here or are we really here? and on a side note when (how long) \nhave we been here, seems there is conflicting data around that shows we've \nbeen on this planet longer than the majority of us learned from text books. \nIt also seems so odd to me, in my current view, that we exist... to find \ncomfort people find answers in spirituality. I prefer to also find answers \nin science as well. Which is why I think more money should go into proper \nscientific research and application than what is currently funded toward \nreligious organizations. If a fraction of the trillions that went into \nreligion world wide would be invested into science it may be very probably \nthat many of our challenges as a species to peacefully exist could be \nsolved. I went off topic slightly but let me circle back. A portion of our \nspecies has found ways to exist without acting on greed, acting peacefully \ntoward others and to self, problem solve without destruction, but for all \nof our species on this planet their environments have not encouraged this \nkind of behavior. Your statement is more about behavior and the science of \nbehavior than it is about the core question of existence of life. If you \ndig past behavioral science into whatever science is deeper and beyond... \nperhaps there is something there to keep your mind occupied in finding \nsolutions instead of insisting on absolutes for outcomes. We as a species, \nis a generality. There is so much variety from one individual to the next \nthat making everyone happy, healthy, productive, and prosperous may not be \nsomething that is attainable because of the simple core reason that we \ncurrently devour life to sustain our own from limited resources. And that \nalone... gives way to a survival paradigm. If we as a life form transcend \nour current universal way of survival by either causing unlimited resources \nin relation to what we need to have our health and happiness and a \nharmonistic-existence.... or by changing our way of sustaining our own life \nwhile maintaining our health and happiness and harmonistic-existence... or \nboth... then perhaps we can accomplish what many of us think we desire. I \ncan agree, I am not happy with where our species currently is.. I feel \nsometimes I would have liked to have been born a thousand years from now or \nmaybe in the speculated golden age thousands of years ago.. but then \nagain.. maybe not.. Maybe for now.. maybe we should do the best we can and \nquestion everything and find as many answers as we can.\ufeff",

Which \nto be proven wrong only one instance contrary needs to be presented. And I \npresent to you a minority of practitioners such as non-violent Monks. Which \nnow makes your statement invalid in logic. Our species perhaps could evolve \nto co-harmonize with each other and, in my opinion nearly equally as \nimportant, with our planet and the millions of other species... but that \ntype of adaptation is not likely to happen without necessity as necessity \nto survive in environment/ecosystem seems to be the driving force behind \nevolution. However, since we can abstract in our minds the potentials of \noutcomes it is perhaps probable that we can evolve as a species to avoid \nthe most detrimental outcomes for our species and other species. \nUnfortunately, it is my current observation that our system of life \ninvolves consuming of other life in order to sustain our own. Unfortunately \nit seems we can not be healthy by only eating inanimate objects such as \nsterile dirt. Our body seems to need the complex proteins and nutrients \nthat life creates. If life exists as we abstract in our minds... in \ngenerality (everyone may have their own perceptions of what life is and of \nexistence) ... then perhaps life itself could be unsustainable. Which begs \nthe question in my mind... beyond just a why or who.. but more basically \nhow are we here or are we really here? and on a side note when (how long) \nhave we been here, seems there is conflicting data around that shows we've \nbeen on this planet longer than the majority of us learned from text books. \nIt also seems so odd to me, in my current view, that we exist... to find \ncomfort people find answers in spirituality. I prefer to also find answers \nin science as well. Which is why I think more money should go into proper \nscientific research and application than what is currently funded toward \nreligious organizations. If a fraction of the trillions that went into \nreligion world wide would be invested into science it may be very probably \nthat many of our challenges as a species to peacefully exist could be \nsolved. I went off topic slightly but let me circle back. A portion of our \nspecies has found ways to exist without acting on greed, acting peacefully \ntoward others and to self, problem solve without destruction, but for all \nof our species on this planet their environments have not encouraged this \nkind of behavior. Your statement is more about behavior and the science of \nbehavior than it is about the core question of existence of life. If you \ndig past behavioral science into whatever science is deeper and beyond... \nperhaps there is something there to keep your mind occupied in finding \nsolutions instead of insisting on absolutes for outcomes. We as a species, \nis a generality. There is so much variety from one individual to the next \nthat making everyone happy, healthy, productive, and prosperous may not be \nsomething that is attainable because of the simple core reason that we \ncurrently devour life to sustain our own from limited resources. And that \nalone... gives way to a survival paradigm. If we as a life form transcend \nour current universal way of survival by either causing unlimited resources \nin relation to what we need to have our health and happiness and a \nharmonistic-existence.... or by changing our way of sustaining our own life \nwhile maintaining our health and happiness and harmonistic-existence... or \nboth... then perhaps we can accomplish what many of us think we desire. I \ncan agree, I am not happy with where our species currently is.. I feel \nsometimes I would have liked to have been born a thousand years from now or \nmaybe in the speculated golden age thousands of years ago.. but then \nagain.. maybe not.. Maybe for now.. maybe we should do the best we can and \nquestion everything and find as many answers as we can.",

Why is \nthere this assumption that intelligent life would want to talk to us, or \nwould want to colonize Earth?\n\nWould it not be more prudent to alow nature to take its course with us and \nwatch what happens to us from afar (and perhaps to take bets ;) )? I mean \nNatGeo or BBC Planet Earth film wild animals in the savannah - they don't \ntry to pet them, or try to catch them or build realestate where they hunt - \nno, they film them from a plane super far, so the animals don't even know \nthey are being watched. Perhaps the vast distances between stars not only \nensure stable orbits for life to develop, but also double as a natural \nquarntine to ensure that colonization and export is considered as a last \nresort and ensures that only those civilizations that learned to live in \nequilibrium with their own star system and eventually don't *need* \ncolonization get to endure for geologic and perhaps cosmic time scales. It \nseems a more reasonable and sustainable solution is not to keep growing \nexpanentially, but to learn to curb and outgrow the need for \never-increasing energy consumption. So the idea that advanced civilization \nwould want to do any sort of colonization or expantion needs to be \nsubstantiated first - it is not at all obvious and, frankly, seems unlikely.\n\nWould they need our water which is probably so abundant in their Oort cloud \nand recycleable *and* of which there is plenty in the nearby *uninhabited* \nfrozen worlds? Wouldn't they rather look for red dwarfs, which is safe \nrealestate for a trillion years? Why do they care about *our* Earth and \n*our* solar system? Do they want to eat exotic animals? Do they need our \nwomen? Are they 16th century Europeans.. in space? Why do we think of them, \nwho are billions perhaps years older as just more tough versions of what we \nwere centuries ago? I don't get that one.\n\nAliens wouldn't solve our problems and might only make things *worse*! \nContact would be by definition an aberation in 100s of thousands of years \nof our evolution.

However (and not that you are \nsaying the opposite, but it needs to be mentioned), the quest of knowledge, \ndiscovery and study is not the same as visitation and certainly not \ncolonization.\n\nIf they want to study us - they probably do not want to manipulate us, at \nleast not in a way that would give away their presence. While in some cases \nwe do make contact with the animals whose behavior we study, we do so only \nbecause there is no other way to study them without being up close - for \nisntance the complexities of chimp social behavior. Otherwise, we \nincreasingly resort to remote/hidden cameras so the observer is not a \nfactor in the observation.\n\nLikewise, in order to study us, they need only to drill a telescope into a \nsmall rock in the Oort Cloud - we won't have any ideas they've done it for \nhundreds of years, if ever.\nIf they are bold, they could even have some sort of microscopic observer \nhere, relaying information to the outside using some sort of point-to-point \ntransmission that we cannot not intercept. They don't have to and likely \ndon't want to make themselves visible to us.\n\nWe usually imagine advanced aliens to be basically technologically advanced \nversions of what Europeans societies were many years ago - colonial \nsocieties that have imposed their power on less advanced societies, as they \nexpanded their spheres of influence.\n\nOur attitudes and methods will change with time - they have changed \nalready: many of those living in the developed countries of today largely \nshun safaris, and applaud efforts of skilled filmmakers when they \nnon-intrusively capture nature in its wildest form.

Its one thing to know how \ntravel to the stars, its another question to decide whether you should and \nwhich star. I think aliens wouldn't come here for one simple reason, the \nresults would be unpredictable. Even with the most sophisticated \ntechnology, I am quite confident that Aliens will not be able to accurately \npredict the future, especially when it comes to complex things like \nvisiting a new planet. Some things, by their nature, cannot in principle be \npredicted. And if history is any sign, things would probably go badly for \nus. Just look what happened when the Spanish visited The Aztecs. So, \ntherefore unless a Alien species is very malignant, which is unlikely as \nthey would be undone by civil wars and such, we shouldn't expect a visit.\n\nWhat I do suspect though is that alien species would study and observe from \nafar, and they will only reveal themselves to us when our technology has \nrisen to a level where they can no longer be hidden from us. \ufeff",
