I'll \nillustrate it with this example: (I'm going to simplify the figures a \nlittle to make it easier to grasp, and i can't remember the exact amounts) \nLabour in power University tuition fees were \u00a31500 p/y 3yrs = \u00a34500. tories \ngot in, hiked prices ridiculously to \u00a39000 p/y \u00a327000. Eds' proposal should \nhe win: a drop to \u00a36000 p/y = \u00a318000. do you get it yet? imagine tories had \nnever got in, and Labour hiked the price up from \u00a34500 to \u00a318000, what \nwould happen? the only difference is time has passed, Labour back in, and \ncan basically say, \"we didn't raise the price, we lowered it, we did you a \nfavour, we're the good guys\"\n\nthey try to convince you they're Roses. wake up and smell them for \nyourself. I'm sure you'll find it kinda smells like Bullshit.\ufeff",

The idea that a mansion tax will pay for everything in the \ncountry and pay off the deficit by next Thursday. The idea that lowerung \ntax on the upper 1% by another 5p is a good idea.\n\nDavid Cameron has even said he will create enough jobs for everyone that \nwants to work- if he's that good at his job, why didn't he do that four \nyears ago?\n\nThe fringe parties are in some ways worse. The SNP are tories pretending to \nbe labour. UKIP are racist, bigoted idiots with a manifesto that would \ndestroy our economy and healthcare systems, as well as break EU law. The \nGreen Party are so far left wing they're actually right wing.\n\nAnd that's the problem. I want change. For too long England has had 'more \nof the same' politics, no matter which party was in charge. But the fringe \nparties are all bat-crap crazy. The Green Party have the most policies that \nI agree with, but they have some that genuinely scare me.\n\nI don't want to vote for 'more of the same', but I can't vote for change \nbacause the outliers are terrifying.\ufeff",

            "text": "Voting isn't just the simple act of marking a ballot on Election Day. It is \na statement of principle. When you vote, you grant to others power you \ndon't have. Do you claim to have the right to take $2,800 a month from my \nfamily and spend it as you please? Would you do so yourself? If so, you're \na thief. If not, you're a hypocrite. Because, when you vote, you purport to \ngrant this power you do not have to others. When you vote, you are a thief \nby proxy.\nBy what right do you do this? Can you even articulate your reasoning for \nthis action that is so antithetical to freedom? I dare you to try. You \nmight surprise yourself with the answer.\nWhen you vote, you participate in the theft and extortion of yourself and \nothers. When you vote, you are an accessory to theft, extortion and all the \ncrimes perpetrated by the beast of government. Your vote is what gives \nlegitimacy to the illegitimate.\nThe conclusion is inescapable: voting is an immoral act. It defies reason \nand incriminates the voter in all manner of transgressions -- not unlike \nholding down a victim while your neighbor has his way with her. It's \ndetestable and I see no reason to ever participate in it unless I choose to \nbe a criminal too.\nThere are only two answers to this problem: embrace being a thief or don't \nvote. For me, the only answer is don't vote.\n\nParadoxically Speaking, Voting isn't just Immoral in itself, it's the \nass-clowns we got running in Government, who do the same things over and \nover again, and as Einstein said \"Keep doing the same things over and over \nagain successfully (for the better or worse) and it will produce the same \nresults\"  \n\nPeople condemn politicians for thinking only in terms of self interest and \nwhat\u2019s in it for me. But what is in the hearts and minds of most voters \nwhen they are deciding which party to support? Yes, precisely: self \ninterest and what\u2019s in it for me. If that is our motivation\nwhen we vote, we will, and do, create that reality by electing politicians \nwho reflect in their actions the very state of mind that we used to give\nthem their power. If you want to change the kind of politicians that \nrepresent us, change yourself. If people still think it is worth voting in \ntoday\u2019s rigged system , then let us vote for what we believe is right and \nnot only for what we believe is right for us, materially, in the short \nterm. Then, if this is done by enough people, we will have politicians that \nmanifest that state of mind.  I Personally was Going to Vote for UKIP, \nHOWEVER when i found out there was Racist and made up of old Labour \nmembers, i thought \"Forget about it\" So Remember Voting is not itself \nimmoral, however Today's Rigged or corrupt system, it is.  Personally I'd \nVote for Monks!  we need a lot more Karma and peace in the world, Monks are \nMore Educated than they let on, Spiritually and Scientifically, and \nPolitics needs to be erased, and set up a Spriritual-High Council. if we \nwas to think in terms of Future-rism we would know this is what they will \nbe doing, and the sooner we move towards these goals, the sooner a better \nfuture will be upon us!\ufeff",
