He didn\u00b4t \nknow why but still, he followed her inside. She was working at the bar and \nhe sat down watching her. The memories of their time together started \ncoming back. He also  begins to remember the moment she left him returning \nthe ring he gave her. He took his own ring, left it on the table and walked \nout. When she came to the table, she saw the ring and ran after him to \nreturn it. He slowly turned toward her and recognition light up in her \neyes. As if time itself unvieded they were back were it all started. The \nrain was falling and he offered his umbrella to a soaked girl. And now, \ntheir story has come to an end. He closed her hand around the ring which \nmeant now the story ended for them both. \nHe turns and walks away moving on. \nA story about how so many things can happen in 60 seconds. The beginning \nand the end.\nNina & Tamara \nAmazing video...love you guys :)))) \ufeff",

He \nwould give her a matching couple ring as a gift.\nBut in the end, they would have to face a painful breakup, which ends up \nwith the girl returning the couple ring to L.\n60 seconds of seeing the future is now over, and he returns back to modern \ntime (present time).\nKnowing that if he fell in love with her, they would breakup, he just \nleaves his ring that he would give her in the future on the table, and \nleaves.\nThe girl sees that L left his ring, and she goes after him to return it.\nThe girl doesnt know anything about the future.\nInstead of taking it, L just tells her to keep the ring.\nThe girl is confused, and looks into L's eyes, and she then also sees the \nfuture of their relationshop that L saw.\nThats why the clock goes backwards 60 seconds, to show that the girl also \nsaw their future.\nThe rain and umbrella scene is showing how they would have met if L decided \nto date her.\nBut since L doesnt want to fall in love with her, he ends up walking out of \nthe cafe alone with an umbrella, just by himself.\nThats why the song quotes \"it only takes 60 seconds to know the story.\" \nI hope this helped ^^\ufeff",
