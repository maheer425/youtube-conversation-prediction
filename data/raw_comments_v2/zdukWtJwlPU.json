Ahsoka Tano is very likely to encounter Vader in either the Vader \ncomics or the second Season of Star Wars rebels, as she's made an \nappearance and trailers for Season 2 indicate that Vader will be making a \nmore prominent appearance as an antagonist (including a clip of him \ncasually wrecking Ezra and Kanan), which may result in the two of them \ncrossing paths.",
