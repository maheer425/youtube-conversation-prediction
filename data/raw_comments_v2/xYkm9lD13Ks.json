Every morning, when I would wake \nup, the first thing that came to my head was \"I fucked up.\" It was so \nfucking shitty. The guilt was eating me alive. Every time I would look at \nher, the thought had come again. \"I fucked up,\" I kept telling myself. Now \nwe're back to how we were before the incident, but with a sense of \nawkwardness whenever we talk. *sigh*\ufeff",
