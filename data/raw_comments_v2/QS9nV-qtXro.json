In \nother words the LT1 not only makes more torque across the entire power \nband, it makes MUCH more torque on the low and midrange, and it's still 60 \nmore than the Mustang at peak. AND it gets 30 MPG. And it makes more power \nearlier with more under the curve.\n\nYou have to wind the Mustang's engine out to get the HP out of it.

Don't be a fucking idiot, please. \n\nAnd yes, if I designed an engine for the Corvette, which has a very low \nhood, I would use a pushrod engine for the same reasons Chevy does.

How about this: Every model of car ever \nmade has had an engine blow. Now every car is unreliable, that's some great \nlogic you're using there, with your sample size of one. Way more than one \nGT-R has blown its engine, so according to you that must mean GT-Rs are far \nless reliable than Z06s. Thanks for making my point for me.\n\nAnd what Z06s are overheating on the road? Show me one example of that ever \nhappening. And yes the Z06 is faster, they're running 10.6 @ 130. And \nthat's just times gotten by owners, not even pro drivers. Even on street \ntires Z06s consistently trap 127 or better which is still faster than any \nGT-R ever made. \n\nYou mentioning 0-60 is just immediately proving you're an idiot. 0-60 times \nare determined by traction, and the GT-R has more traction than the Z06 \ndoes. Of course that doesn't mean the GT-R is faster, because obviously it \nisn't. but real fucking morons believe that 0-60 is an indicator of which \ncar is faster. LOL.\n\nIn the 5-60 test where the GT-R's launch control and traction advantage is \ntaken out of the equation, the Z06 did it in 3.2 seconds, the GT-R did it \nin 3.9. Do you understand now or do you need it explained to you some more?\n\nAnd you think fixing the alignment so it's within factory spec is \"tuning\" \nit? So is the GT-R \"tuned\" because its alignment was in factory spec, you \nidiot? I mean seriously, how stupid are you? And you already know the Z06's \nalignment was off, why do you think Pobst said the handling was off in the \nZ06? Do you think maybe it had anything to do with the fact that the rear \nalignment was off? Christ you're stupid. In the followup test MT did in \nwhich the Z06's alignment was fixed and it ran faster laps than the GT-R, \nPobst said the Z06 felt much more planted, which is exactly what you would \nexpect from a car whose rear alignment is not off any more. \n\nSo you're wrong on all counts, because every driving quirk you were \nreferring to was being caused by a bad alignment. Once that was fixed, \nthose quirks went away. Go to motor trend and read about it yourself, don't \ntake my word for it. So not only does the GT-R not win in reality or in lap \ntimes or test results, but it doesn't win in drivability either. And it \nstill costs twice as much as the Z06. ",

I said 0-60 is a \nmeasurement of traction, not performance. Because it is. 0-60 times are \ncompletely, 100% dependent on traction. Are you denying that? This is a \nstupidity test, so answer carefully.\n\nAnd calling me the moron here while being unable to spell \"you're\" is not \nvery convincing, son. You're the one who tried to use 0-60 as a valid \nmetric of performance while using an AWD car vs. a RWD car, apparently \nwithout understanding that of course the AWD car is going to be faster in a \n0-60 test. That would make you the moron, not me. \n\nAnd yes, in this one solitary isolated video, the GTPR won. And it was \ndiscovered later that the GT-R won because the Z06 had an alignment \nproblem. Which would explain why this one test is the only time a GT-R has \never been able to beat the Z06. You remember the VIR times, right? Would \nyou care to explain those, if the GT-R is faster? Hmm? 8 seconds a lap \nslower is the opposite of faster.\n\nYou want to talk about ignoring the facts, there you go. I don't care that \nyou don't LIKE the results, the results are still the results. If you want \nto cry about it, do it on your own time. \n\nAnd even after I had to explain to you why the GT-R is faster 0-60 (hint - \nit's traction, not power... obviously) you mentioned it AGAIN. Do you have \na learning disability? Is that the problem? And here's an example of 1/4 \nmile:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcHcIF6qDNI\n\nNote that this was a stock Z06 on STREET TIRES not drag radials, so it was \nstill having traction issues. And it was also a MANUAL which is slower than \nthe auto in the 1/4 mile. And finally, look at the trap speed - 127 is \nstill faster than any GT-R ever made. Stock Z06s that can get traction off \nthe line, usually with drag radials, are hitting 130 MPH traps and 10.6 \nETs. If you don't understand how traction helps RWD cars get better ETs and \ntrap speeds, then you need to go back to school.\n\nAnd to correct your misconception, the GT-R beat the Z06 around ONE track \nduring ONE test, when the Z06 had a bad alignment. The Z06 has beaten the \nGT-R around many other tracks. VIR is just the most obvious example.",

Did you not understand the part about the Z06 putting \ndown a lap time at VIR that was 8 seconds faster than the nismo GT-R? And \nby the way 8 seconds is a lot more than the ~1 second the nismo beat the \nZ06 by in this one test you're referring to.\n\nIs there any particular reason I have to keep going over what I already \ntold you?\n\nAlso, I already know you're a moron. You know how I know that? Because you \nbrought up 0-60 times. Do you understand the main factor in getting a good \n0-60 time? It's traction. What is the GT-R's one advantage over the Z06?\n\nTraction. Do you see where this is going? All AWD cars have artificially \nhigh 0-60 times because they don't have traction issues off the line. The \nZ06 has traction issues past 60 MPH, because it's putting so much HP to the \nground through just the rear wheels that the tires can't hold traction.\n\nSo you referring to 0-60 times is an indicator that you don't understand \nthat 0-60 is a measurement of traction, not performance. You know how you \nget around that? You do a 5-60 test, it's an acceleration test from a \nrolling idle. When you eliminate the nismo GT-R's AWD traction advantage, \nyou know what happens?\n\nNismo GT-R 5-60: 3.9 seconds\nZ06 5-60: 3.2 seconds\n\nTHAT is how you see which car is actually faster. That's why the Z06 runs \nfaster 1/4 mile times when you remove the traction variable, because the \nZ06 is the faster car. The power to weight ratio should have told you that \nanyway, but you seem to be kind of dense.\n\nYou saying the alignment issue is \"kinda bullshit\" is almost unfathomably \nstupid. Are you calling FACTS \"kinds bullshit\" now? The alignment issue is \nsomething they discovered after the fact, after the tests, after it was all \ndone. This is a fact, and it came from motor trend themselves. And then you \nsaying a bad alignment wouldn't affect track times?
