There is a legend on who invented pizza, if you're interested, \nhere it is:\nIt all started in 1889, when the king and the queen of Italy came to visit \nNaples. They were called Umberto I and Queen Margherita. Since then, pizza \nhad just been flattened bread cooked in oven with pretty basical other \nthings on top (Oil, or Garlic). A man called Raffaele Esposito, who was the \nbest pizza maker at the time, made three types of pizzas for the queen: The \n\"Marinara\" which is a pizza with tomatoes and oregano, the \"Mastunicola\" \nwith lard, cheese and basilic, and finally a pizza with tomatoes, \nmozzarella cheese (that anyway is completely different from the mozzarella \ncheese you have in US) and basilic. The colors of the ingredients are the \nsame as the italian flag (Green, White and Red) . The Queen enjoyed so much \nthe last pizza that wrote a letter to Raffaele to thank him for that \ndelicious flattened bread. Raffaele, to thank for his part the Queen, \ncalled the pizza \"Margherita\", which then became the most common type of \npizza.\ufeff",
