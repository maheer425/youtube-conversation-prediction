I get what you're saying. My point on stimuli was not \nthat they are equal, but that they are all stimuli: they affect you \nsomehow, and they all come with possible benefits and possible \nrisks/downsides. The conceptual separation between stimulation through \nsubstance and stimulation through anything else like driving or having \ncoffee is arbitrary. Every other action comes with its own set of benefits, \nrisks, and cons, but you don't call them poison or especially dangerous.",

            "text": "+Cody Arnold Your entire argument is based on false analogy logical \nfallacy, and you have the gall to accuse me of logical deficiency.\nOkay then.\n\nFirst, all stimuli is not equal, and to say so is the highest bounds of \nstupidity. Getting hugged and getting hit with a truck both are external \nstimuli. Both touch your body, which then sends signals to your brain. \nSurprisingly, THAT DOES NOT MEAN GETTING HIT WITH A TRUCK AND GETTING \nHUGGED ARE THE SAME!\n\nSecond, the definition of drugs are substances that affect the human body. \nHowever, it takes a remarkably thick person to look through this comment \nchain, and then assume I meant all drugs. I will give you a hint, since \napparently you are the aforementioned remarkably thick person. I DO NOT \nMEAN MEDICINAL DRUGS, NOR DO I MEAN FOOD/DRINK.\n\nThird, since everything carries some risk, it obviously can't be \nirresponsible to take risks. However, performing actions with high risk is \nirresponsible. For example, chances of dying in a car crash are very low, \nmaking utilization of cars a responsible decision.\nMeanwhile, the chances of dying from ingesting poison are very high, making \nit an irresponsible decision. Risk is always there, but it varies from \naction to action. Obviously.\n\nFourth, the issue here isn't risk. Anytime you take meth, you aren't \n\"risking\" danger, you are consuming poison, and immediately damaging your \nhealth. It isn't risky to do drugs, it is suicidal.\n\nFifth, the idea that putting poison into your body is bad, is not an \nopinion. It is a medical, irrefutable fact. It is not an opinion that \ncopper is conductive, nor that the moon's gravitation causes the tides, nor \nthat the boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius, it is fact. Learn \nthe difference.\n\nSixth, opinions cannot be cowardly. I sincerely hope that was just a typo, \nbut I imagine it isn't, considering you.\n\nSeventh, yours is the most disappointing comment I have come across in \nquite a while, and I would appreciate it if you became educated before you \ncomment again.\n\nEighth, have a wonderful life, and be sure to keep it long by not actively \npoisoning your body.

External stimuli that are altering your \nconsciousness. \"Drugs can't be used responsibly.\" Really? How does that in \nany way come from logic? What about all the people who take pain meds for \nan injury, smoke weed (even every day), drink coffee in the morning, get \ndrunk on Fridays, and alter their consciousness in general who DON'T \nnegatively affect their lives or others at all? \n\nMaybe at this point you'd argue, \"You never know what could happen if you \ntake something. Taking that risk is always irresponsible.\" There are many \ndirect examples that prove you wrong, but I'll make it more obvious just \nfor you.\n\nYou probably drive a car. You are risking an accident every time, and \nthere's even a chance of ending others' lives. HOWEVER, you probably have a \ndriver's license with experience and skill and knowledge of driving. You \nhave drastically reduced your risk of death/injury/pull-over because you \nwant to avoid an accident, so you became a responsible driver. Same thing \nwith psychoactives. There are some objectively dangerous drugs that are \nunpredictable in nature like bath-salts and new chems, but not all. That's \nwhy you are wrong. Your opinion is wrong and cowardly, and you have no \nvalid argument.  ",
