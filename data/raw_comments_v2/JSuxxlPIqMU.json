I was gonna \nkill it until i started getting closer to it and i think it's gonna crawl \non me or just jump on me. Plus i hate hearing the sound of killing a \nspider. The sound of it sounds like smashing potato chips just with more \ncrackles. So it ended up crawling into the vent and i slept. The next day \nit came back and i just told my dad to kill it :P.
