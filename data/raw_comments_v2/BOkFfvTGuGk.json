That alone has made me appreciate so many things that I have \ntaken for granted and it just opened my eyes as to what I want to do as a \nperson. I want to bring the world a little bit closer, explore our \nbeautiful planet, and to see people from all corners of the Earth. I have \nfound love for all people, even if they may not like me as much I still see \nthem as a person, an individual, some one special.

The most important people in history for science, liberalizing \nrevolutions and technology were either greatly different from their fellow \nmen, or in great opposition to the norms of society.  \nTesla and Einstein were both against using technology and science for war, \nand Einstein had bad results at elementary and high school. \n\nFurther back in time ,the great scientists and philosophers were usually \npoor until death, or /and had problems fighting the elites of society, as \nmore knowledge to the society means less power for classical hierarchies. \n\nWhat about today? Well let us be honest: In the western world as well as in \nmany other countries, the youngsters like Tesla, Einstein, Newton, da \nVinci, Sokrates, were...would all be medicated into conformity being seen \nas having \"adhd\" or \"adaptability problems\"... They would either have \ncommited suicide, or would have become salesmen or ordinary workers. \n\nSo until the culture values variation of personalities enough ,and until \nthe monetary systems are gone as the requirement for survival or success, \nuntil the classical militaristic and religious elites are gone from \nledership...there will not be a better world for \"who you really are\". \n\nUSA and parts of Europe are among the worst areas of the world regarding \nteasing in schools, that can have devastating effects. This reveals a very \nprimitive culture. In other words, only a lucky small minority will be \nsuccesful.  However in a more civilized society, the majority would be \nsuccesful in peaceful ways of 'being who they are\". \nTo know why and how, we have to start studying the Zeitgeist movement's \nideas and the Venus project. \nThere is no other way\ufeff",

Also, ignore \nassholes that tell you to \"Be the best at sucking\". Fuck them. Yeah, I \nagree with the idea that you have to learn how to make things work for you. \nBut you have to be good -- or get good -- in order to do that. This whole \nfeel good without actually doing good is bullshit, in my opinion. Keep \nworking on yourself and you may find what you're looking for. If not, fear \nnot, you will have still earned something by trying(while we're on the \nsubject, fuck yoda with his \"Do or do not\" philosophy).",

I was just reading the comments when i happened to cross by \nyour comment and i'd like to give you a different perspective on it. \nAnything is easier said then done right? I'd like to believe that too, but \nthat exact thinking right there can either break or make you. If everyone \nwere to, in some way, take their first steps to expanding their own \nknowledge you'd be amazed by the possible effects it could have on the \nworld. Bettering yourself, educating yourself(on literally anything you'd \nlike to know), being more empathetic towards each-other. You say that \ntheoretically we shouldn't care about what others think because they don't \nhave any impact whatsoever, but that's just not the truth. Everyone around \nus is an individual who has his or her own genetic make up that makes up \neverything inside them including the human consciousness. We are coexisting \non a planet with so much to offer us its unfathomable! Sure people will \njudge you but that's because they are unhappy with their life or they're \ndealing with a lot on their plate and feel like they're in this battle \nalone. None us are though. Easier said then done is what i used to believe. \nGranted, i'm still at such a young age but do believe when i say that \nyou'll never really know of the unknown until you to venture into it. There \nare millions of great people out there who might not have the information \nthat you do but that doesn't have to be the case. Set an example for them \nand lead the pack. The message is out and it's up to us to spread it and \nmake it a trend in our society. Remember that we are the universe! The \nuniverse itself is limitless: so why should we be mindful of our limits and \nnot consider our capabilities? I think that empathy should be spread across \nthe world and people of all nations should invoke that inner explorer and \nmaybe this world could propel us into the next century of technological and \nsocietal growth.

So, are we \ntaught by our parents/teachers to expect and receive attention? No not \nreally (speaking for majority). If anything, they have advised us to not \nstick out and in their defense it was simply to make sure we didn't get \ninto trouble. Next, are we to be selfish? Not necessarily unless you were \nraised from individuals with those traits or acquired them through peers. \nThe only viable solution here, in my opinion, is to disregard the way you \nwere raised and disregard the idealized norm in order to develop yourself \nas your own individual.
