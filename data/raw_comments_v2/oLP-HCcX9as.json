If the FR-S/BRZ has 200HP from \nthe factory, and this car has double that, where's the other 50HP coming \nfrom?\n\nI'm curious because I drive a turbo FR-S and the car is great. The tune is \nsolid and I no longer have the 4k RPM power plateau like the BRZ in this \nvideo, but I still get the feeling like the car could use another another \n50-100HP.\n\nWhen I'm driving in colder climates, the car feels perfect and I'm \nsatisfied with its power. But I live in Florida, so the only time the car \nfeels responsive is when there's a cold front or when I travel out of state.\n\nIf the stock engine has more potential than an EJ motor, how can I get more \nout of it like Crawford did with this BRZ? Outside of an engine swap, \nbigger turbo, or E85, what options are there to get more power?\ufeff",
