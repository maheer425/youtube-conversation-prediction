Pour water into the cylinder until the cylinder is filled to a \nheight of H.\n\nNow, construct another device for holding water, but this time in the shape \nof a square. Pour the water from the cylinder into the square. If the depth \nof the water in the square is less than H, then the square is too big. If \nthe depth of the water in the square is greater than H, then the square is \ntoo small.\n\nNow, this couldn't easily be done on paper, as it would take a lot of time \nto construct and reconstruct.
