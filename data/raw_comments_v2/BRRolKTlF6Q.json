If that's the case, an appropriate error message \nwill be returned or displayed. 1:25 in the video is the way the computer \nwould do it. It would just keep going, so it's stopped before it even \nstarts.\n\nI think mostly all computational devices do this. I guess you could add a \nsmall logical unit in the hardware that puts a limit on the number of \ncycles that are performed on a single division operation (base it on the \nnumber of bits), but it's much better to just simply check for zero \nbeforehand (takes much less time). You could probably also check if the \nprevious value is equal to the same value, but still, checking if a value \nis 0 takes less time.\ufeff",

The problem with that is it breaks a lot of algebra. \n (To put it in math speak, the algebraic structure doesn't form a field or \neven a ring or a additive group anymore)  For instance x + y = x + 5 \ndoesn't necessarily imply that y = 5 anymore because \u221e has no additive \ninverse..  To get y = 5, you would have to assume x isn't infinity.  (x/y)y \nis not necessarily equal to x anymore because division by zero can't retain \nit's definition as being that number by which the denominator multiplied by \ngives you the numerator.

If division is subtraction then we can go further up to infinity in \nthe negative numbers like \n4 - 0 = 0\n0 - 4 = - 4\n- 4 - 4 = - 8  and so on \nProblem with zero: Definition of zero: An argument at which the valve of a \nfunction vanishes OR something that has no existence. Further it has no \ndimension. \n\n1- It is said that something divided by zero = infinity or undefined. \nFor example; 1 / 0 = infinity OR 1 / 0 = infinity / 1; \nBy cross multiplication 0 x infinity = 1 x 1 OR 0 = 1 which is impossible. \nSo this means 1/ 0 is not = infinity. Similarly, 1 / 0 = infinity = 2 / 0 = \n3 / 0 = 4 / 0 and so on. Say 2 / 0 = 3 / 0 ; again by cross multiplication, \nwe get 0 = 0. So again something divided by zero is not equal to infinity.\n\nFurther if we take the limit of 1 / x, say 1 / 0.00000000001 Then 1 / \n0.00000000001/100000000000 = 100000000000 / 1\nIndirectly this means divide 10000000000 on one entity.\n\nSo if we divide by extremely small number BUT NOT ZERO then it may equal to \ninfinity. \n\nFor simplicity: lets say we have divide 20 oranges in a box. Divide them on \n4 person. Each person would get 5 oranges as 20 / 4 = 5. Nothing would left \nin a box.\n\nNow divide the same oranges on one person. 20 / 1 = 20. This means one \nperson would get all 20 oranges. Nothing would left in a box. \nNow if we divide the same 20 oranges among zero person then zero person \nwould get zero oranges. Since there is no being out there therefore 20 \noranges would still remain therein the box. \nSimilarly, if we consider the dimension then we can say 5 oranges per \nperson, 20 oranges per person or 20 oranges per zero person. \nThus if the graph of function y = 1/x in which x approaches zero from right \n, y approaches infinity. A graph touches the y-axis upon division by zero \nand hence forming a closed loop if connected to the graphs of other \nquadrants. Since a closed loop is a defined boundary therefore division by \nneither equal to infinity nor undefined. \n\n2 - Anything to the power zero = 1 \nExample 2^x = 32 , As 32 = 2 ^5 therefore 2^x = 2^5.; since bases are same \ntherefore we get x = 5 after setting the exponents equal. Thus \n0^0 = 0^0 = 0 \nSince zero is not a member of ANYTHING as per aforementioned definition of \nzero therefore zero to the power means nothing to the power \n\n3 - Anything multiplied by zero is zero. 3 x 3 = 9, 3 x 2 = 6, 3 x 1 = 3, 3 \nx 0 = 0 but i would say this multiplication is simply impossible. 0 x 0 = 0 \nof course \nConsider the x and y axis on cartesian coordinates system \n3 x 3 = 9 means, Go 3 units on x-axis and then 3 units on y-axis, we 9 unit \nsquare\n3 x 2 = 6 means, Go 3 units on x-axis and then 2 units on y-axis, we 6 unit \nsquare\n3 x 1 = 3 means, Go 3 units on x-axis and then 1 units on y-axis, we 3 unit \nsquare \n3 x 0 = ? means, Go 3 units on x-axis and then 0 units on y-axis, Although \nwe get zero unit square but we still have one dimension which can't be \nstretched to zero / origin because we stuck at 3 on x-axis not at origin so \nwe can't go up on y-axis. If 3 x 0 = 0 then zero unit square means units of \nboth x and y are zero which is wrong in this case. Can we get 3 units of \nx-axis back if 3 x 0 = 0 in reverse process. No!\n0 x 0 = 0 means, Go 0 units on x-axis and then 0 units on y-axis, we 0 unit \nsquare\nSimilarly, we write sometimes for simplicity 3 x 2 = 2 + 2 + 2 but \ntechnically this wrong as per diminutional analyses\nwe get 6 unit square which is dimension of AREA while on RHS we simply get \n6 unit ( which the dimension of LINE)\nSo by definition of zero, it can\u2019t be added, subtracted, divided and \nmultiplied with something.\ufeff",

There are mechanisms in place to prevent that from happening \nbefore it gets going and consumes all resources the device has (such as \nmemory or processing power).\n\nIn low-level programming, like in processor's instructions you have either \nA) a mechanism like the high-level ones mentioned earlier, but way more \nrudimentary, for processor's instructions are simple commands (actually, \nthere is no division command, it is just a tweaked and more complex sum \noperation) or B) No way to stop, which will lead the processor into either \na wrong, gibberish result as memory inside the processor and/or device \nstarts to overlap or just a total freeze of said processor, if it doesn't \nkills itself by consuming all the resources it has.\n\nThese stopping mechanisms I mentioned are ready to block the division from \nhappening before it has even started and usually answer to it with an Error \nmessage like \"Math Exception: Cannot divide by Zero\" and the processing is \neither stalled and the code running it killed or the Exception is passed as \nthe answer to the division asked and the error will propagate, leading \nmostly to a NaN (Not a Number) fault.\ufeff",

            "text": "You're not supposed to draw two arrows on the axes. Only one in the \npositive direction for each. Standard mathematical convention. \n\nAlso I'm pretty sure even in the real number plane, y = x^x is shaded in a \nweird way in the Second Quadrant because all the multiples of reciprocals \nof even numbers(I think, correct me if I'm wrong) don't work in the real \nnumber plane. For example, (-1/2)^(-1/2) doesn't register in the real \nnumber plane but (-1/3)^(-1/3) does. I checked WolframAlpha, but it doesn't \nregister anything that seemed relevant. Most textbooks, from my knowledge, \njust decide 0^0 is undetermined.\ufeff",
