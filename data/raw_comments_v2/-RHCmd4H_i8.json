It all started when I \ncalled \"Mr. -F\" to cancel our 1st date (as I had just accepted a \nrelationship with some else) but he was very, very persistent and I was a \nnaive Un. 1st year. So I told him I normally eat my lunch at the university \ncafeteria and he could talk to me (NOT A DATE) while I ate/waited for my \nboyfriend to get off work and join me. \"Mr. -F\" agreed, but then proceeded \nto instruct me (not ask) to ware makeup and a skirt. I internally vowed I \nwould never hand my # to a guy I had previously spent <1hr with.\n My new boyfriend laughed when I told him about \"Mr. F\" and my concerns, \nand half teasingly said he would NOT come to my rescue; \"I don't need to \ntake care of you\". (FYI: he's now an old ex-boyfriend) So when lunch came \nthat day I was not really happy to see \"Mr. -F\" none the less I was polite. \nDespite instructing me to look nice (which I did; stupid afternoon choir \nperformance!) he was rather shabby. I was a little confused by this, but \ndidn't say anything. We proceeded to chat, in which he asked some questions \nabout my eating habits including \"do you normally have that much for \nlunch?\". I didn't see the harm so I answered them \"Well no, I normally eat \na little more but I'm singing later. But then I don't eat much dinner\".\n At about 10mins chatting, he pulls out a paper he wrote and gives it to me \nto read. I had to skim through it a couple of times to make sure I was not \nmistaken because believe what I was reading! It was a paper on how men \nreally dig fat chicks more than skinny. ...fat? Fat?! FAT?!!!!! Sure I was \na little over weight from my year and a half overseas but... no, that can't \nbe it, cause no guy is so stupid as to just call a girl 'fat' even when it \nis true, right? \"Mr. -F\" then proceeded to twist all the answers I gave him \nto basically say I over ate and he thought I was a hot tub of lard. ... ... \n... Oh if glares could kill!!\n With nothing ethical coming to mind that I could do to him (why couldn't I \njust think to throw water in his face!), I got up, said was off to see my \nboyfriend, and left. I may have hide in a ladies bathroom a couple of times \nto make sure he didn't follow me.\n Maybe I'm being too spiteful on the matter, but whatever class he wrote \nthat paper for, I hope  \"Mr. -F\" Flunked! \ufeff",

Then finally they decided it \nwas time to go to the dance. We go outside and he sits her in the front and \ntalks to her the whole way (I think it was about 50min from her place to \nthe dance) we get to the dance and it's ending we get the last 3 songs in \nwhich he danced with her for 2 and me for one (because she told him to) \nthen to top things off after sitting in the back seat for the long 20 min \nback hoe he invites her to my place for dessert. we have dessert and he \ncan't stop talking to her and I can't get a word in 3am comes around and I \nhave absolutely had it I interrupted and kicked them out of my house.\ufeff",
