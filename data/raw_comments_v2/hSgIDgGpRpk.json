Meaning something near an atom [like light] can \nbe traveling straight but to outside observers it appears it is moving in a \ncircle or \"torus shell\" space.  Caused by amplifying, crossing, standing \nwaves of energy that change the shape of space and rate of time near the \natom.  i.e the reason atoms don't fly apart like atomic bombs.\n   What Einstein missed.  If he knew that e=mcc should actually be e=mc/Tr \nthen he didn't say.  Einstein originally thought Minkowski [Einstein's old \nteacher] was just doing tricks with math.  Look up Minkowski space on \nwikipedia.  Minkowski basically tied together Poincare, Maxwell, Lorentz \nand Einstein works by adding what they could not see which is the \nunderstanding that time is part of space and when size of space changes \nthen so does the rate of time. Which is why E=mc^2 should not be e=mcc but \ne=mc/[time rate].  Time rate of anything moving at c is near zero, like an \ninversion of 300,000,000m/s is .00000000033 s/m [ie very slow time].  So \nthat it shows what space-time is and that mass is concentrated energy for a \nreason since there can be nothing that moves faster than c or slower than \nzero time rate per frame.  Duh!  Since Einstein missed this that also means \n[and I can tell] that he didn't make the connection that gravity is a form \nof light and travels at light speed and that all energy [not just the \ngravity energy] is responsible for changing the concentration of \nspace-time.  Modern science barely has a clue.  Science went way off track \nin the 1930s - 40s once the atomic bomb and quest for understanding \nparticles \"quantum\" occured.  What they do not see now, if they ever did, \nis that symetry and vibrations of EMF energy [light] is particle as \nconcentrated light and some harmonics are what hold atoms together.  \nNuclear fission is the injection of a \"neutron\"  what's a neutron?  It's an \n\"alpha particle\" bounced off the core of another atom.  It is very short \nlived when outside an atom [decays] because there is not enough symmetry \n[energy density enough to maintain space-time warp symmetry around it] \nholding together the space-time of that energy.  Why does it cause \nfission?...I may need to think on that more...not coming to me...must be \nthat neutrons carry a larger space and faster time contained by a decaying \nsymmetry shell so that it partially breaks the harmonics of high density \natoms like uranium and plutonium.  Thanks for the question. Helped me \nunderstand what I hadn't before.",

I see that they describe nothing of reality but \nsometimes they come back around to describing what has already been \ndescribed in other ways by someone else.  Einstein made a good start on a \nbetter understanding of the fabric of the universe with Relativity [the \nbook].  He didn't get it all quite right.  In the book Einstein only \ndevoted 2 pages to Minkowski time formula and part of that 2 pages was in \nadmitting that the formula had to exist for Relativity to make sense.  \nAlso,  Einstein wrote in the back of that little informative book [on the \nlast page]  how it is a fools path to go searching for quantum.  I see now \nwhy he said it.  True understanding must come from observation and \nawareness without being sucked into confusion by genius want-to-be that \nspout bull sh**.  It appears to me that most of the scholastic higher ups \n[and their students] get to a point where they get confused when looking at \nspace-time...what do they do then when they are supposed to be the \nauthority of physics wisdom and explanation of the mechanics of the \"to \nsmall to see\"...they produce bull sh** and they defend their bull shi* \nstance with  a vengeance.   Anyhow,  to understand the invisible small \nstuff just keep in mind that everything is made of a wide range of EMF \nlight frequencies and that when there is a difference in energy density \nthen there is a space-time gradient and if that gradient is large enough \n*(Lorentz space contraction and time contraction with inverse square law \nspace-time warp pattern) in a small enough location then some of the EMF \ncreate harmonic looping space where light is trapped.  So really particles \nof any type are just some (in relation to other regions [space-times]) \nconcentrated space-time.  E=mc2  should actually read E=m c/Tr .  There can \nbe no c X c = c^2 since nothing can move faster than c in relation to other \nspace-times.  Apparently to me, Einstein took Poincare's E=mc [which did \nnot work] and just squared c.  Why?  I don't know.  Maybe he noticed that \nit would balance the equation.  Although it does work as a numerical \nequivalence it does not explain why it works because Einstein missed it.  \nIf you invert and divide with one of the c of the equivalence  e=mcc then \nyou get a [seemingly meaningless derived unit measured in s/m] Tr.  That \nunit is the key.  So simple.  Why or how Einstein or anyone else could miss \nthat when something moves at the speed of light that that object is also \nslow of time in relation to the observer ...that is baffling.   So, the \n\"why\" of my equation is that M mass is a bunch of  contained energy when in \nrelation to an adjacent space-time if the energy is moving at c with the \nTr[time rate] which are both constants as laws of the fabric of the \nuniverse. c and Tr are directly related.  What that equation does not show \nis that even when something is not moving at c it can still have energy and \nany energy density has a time rate in relation to other space-time [energy \nconcentration].   That is they why  of Dark Matter and Energy.  Physicists \nhave not given the cosmologists proper formula for time adjustments.  Very \nmuch pathetic that the scholastic community is so lame brained that such \nterms could even come about.",

He described 'particle light' as localized (in a space) radiation \nthat he named 'lightquanta'.\n\nThe term has many more meaning's in many different fields because it's \ndefinition is starkly simple.  Wiki's referenced definition is:\n\"The minimum amount of any physical entity involved in an interaction\"\n\nYou're confusion Quantum with Quantum MECHANIC's ... a new field of physics \n(at the time) that relied on quanta of energy in the sub-atomic particles \nin the standard model (6 quarks (up, down, charm, strange, top, bottom), 6 \nanti-quarks, 6 leptons (electron, tau, muon and their respective \nneutrino's), 6 anti-leptons, and of course the 4 force carrier particles \ncalled bosons (photon's carry the EM force, 'gravitons'* carry the force of \ngravity, gluons impart the strong nuclear force and W-/W+/Z0 carry the weak \nnuclear force) .... AND the final piece of the puzzle ... the HIGGS BOSON, \nthe force carrier that impart's mass on matter)..\n\nHe worked with quantum physics because he had to.  His objections were \nmetaphysical.  He couldn't accept that EVERYTHING is random like many of \nthe principles of quantum theories requires but he also couldn't deny that \nthese quantum theories explained things that were otherwise unexplainable \nexceptionally well.  He did many quantum physics maths during his life.\n\n*We have never observed a 'graviton', and since gravity is so many order's \nof magnitude WEAKER then the other 3 forces it's not believed we'll have \nthe beam energy (in particle collider's) to generate enough graviton's that \nthey're existence can be statistically confirmed.  I don't know exactly how \nmuch but gravity is billions or trillions of times weaker then the other 3 \nforces.  People mistakenly think it's a strong force ... and in fact they \nthink it's the strongest force, but it's because gravity permeates all of \nspacetime whereas EM, Strong nuclear and weak nuclear are localized in \nspace.
