Or \nthose bacteria weren't required anymore to break down the bacteria riddled \nfoods that weren't cooked or were dirty. \n\nI know we're growing a new generation of bacteria sensitive folk because of \nour insane amounts of cleanliness, which is ridiculous (Thank Women for \nthat one).\n\nWe don't know. \"More the better\" doesn't always apply. \n\nVideo starts off saying we barely know anything about the effects of this \nmicrobiome then they go ahead and assume that larger diversity is a \npositive thing.\ufeff",

Social science finds that the maximum natural personal \"circle\" \nextends to about 100 fellows, and tribal connections fade out after 60,000, \nwhich was posited by the classical greeks as well in observing their own \nfledging attempts at democracy.\n\nTo exceed this evolutionary limitation requires a factor of enlightenment, \nby which there is potentially no limitation. To see the generations of \nstars who shed their dust to the accumulation of our later-generation solar \nsystem, to find that connection which extends in scale from amino acids to \ngalactic clusters, one must make peace with both the joys and burdens of \neverything that such a process may entail.\n\nAt first the loss of \"self\" may be confusing, frightening, even paralyzing. \nOnce accepted that we are each but nodes of conscious focus along a \nspectrum of emergent interaction, the burden is lightened, the choices no \nlonger conflicted; and one may be beneficent without counting the cost, and \nignore temptations of avarice and jealousy as the pale illusions that they \nare.\n\nThis is the nature of communion: that information-energy is conserved and \ntransformed from one expression to another, from one level to another. \nAlthough each expression and level is unique according to its properties, \nthere is a simultaneous sharing of the total across all elements and scales.\n\nThe disaster of imperial societies is based upon this fallacy: \"I think, \ntherefor I am,\" which serves mostly to the vanity. The reality of conscious \ncommunion, however, is more effectively approached by the realization: \"I \nseem to be a verb.\"\n\nThe main hope for our social species may lie in the possibility that enough \nof us may understand the difference and embrace the process, that the rest \nwill remember this ancient paradigm and return to a state of sustainable \nnumbers and desires.
