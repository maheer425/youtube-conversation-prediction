They were all of people (I assume adults, \nthough I could be wrong) who assumed the YouTubers were pot-smoking, stupid \nclowns who didn't really understand the world around them. Insulting their \nintelligence aside, they also criticized Obama and how he was more willing \nto talk with \"nobodies\" (i.e. the YouTubers), rather than talk with global \npowerhouse leaders. \n\nThe thing that irritates me, to the point that I actually laugh, is how \nthey are so quick to apply labels in their little boxes of words they've \ncome to know and love to any new \"threat\" or \"idea\". If they already didn't \nlike Obama, then this surely shows that he is not worthy of Presidency, \ncorrect? I mean, it's asinine to think of a President actually *talking* \nwith the people he's leading. That's ludicrous, they imply. \n\nMy point is the same point Hank eloquently said in the video. I may \nparaphrase or severely truncate, but still: People love their borders. The \nfact that borders exist means that diversity on either side of it exists. \nBreaking the border and unleashing the bountiful diversity that exists in \nthe zone where two biomes meet is more of a detriment than a positive one. \nSure, more diversity exists, more growth arises, and more mixing occurs, \nbut it's also very arduous to keep standing in such an awful area.\n\nMaybe we need to rethink what Borders are meant to be. And maybe we need to \nrealize that they aren't walls made of steel, meant to deter any outside \ninfluence. \nDoors exist for a reason. \nMaybe it'd be nice for us to open the door to new ideas every now and then \nto allow something beautiful to grow.\ufeff",

From my own \npersonal observations, I think with a two party system the conflict (me \nverses you) is sort of built-in. I think political conflict can be \nproductive because it inspires collective engagement from the public, but \nit also results in a lot of anger because of disagreement rather than \ndebate. In Canadian politics (at least where I am on the west coast) we \nhave conflict, but not many voters get aggressive about their political \nviews. However, we also lack engagement.\n\n\n\n    \ufeff",

You were a great candidate and asked fantastic questions.\n\nIn response to your: \"Holy Shit, I Interviewed the President:\" link, I have \na few things to say:\n\n1)Glozell Green is not a great candidate...I feel like you are almost \nobligated to defend her (you preach no \"judging\" and are a fellow youtuber \netc.). She does not strike me, in the least, as intelligent enough for \nlegitimate input for the president. Just no, I am sorry, just no.\nBethany Mota represents, to a degree, this generation and can have \nlegitimate input. Glozell Green is 52 and does absolutely degrading things \nfor entertainment. She is not worth the president's time.\n\n1a) The fact that you don't find anything wrong with her saying \"dick\" in a \nconversation with the president is disturbing to me. You claim this as \nbeing \"honest\", yet its actually just rude and disrespectful. Being honest \ndoesn't mean losing basic manners, especially when you're in the presence \nof the President of the United States!\nBethany Mota was being honest, I respect that, but Glozell Green was \nshowing her ignorance and poor manners.\n\n2)What do you consider proper distribution of the news?\nPolitics is boring. Period. In my opinion, Comedy Central \"news\" shows are \npretty much mocking everything that pops into their face. Its pure \nentertainment, not news.\n\nInterviewing Youtubers was chosen for entertainment. People of today expect \na plethora of entertainment at every turn. Which some would argue is \nexactly what is hurting the political involvement with this new generation. \nYou can't make Politics entertaining; you have to actually enjoy it \npersonally. People used to be involved because they had too; not because it \nentertained them.\nIs this argument a legitimate concern, today?\ufeff",

Its much easier to focus on the guy \ninterviewing the president ( you =)), make a judgement and have a feeling \nof some self worth for 2 secants than it is to stand up and say and or type \nsomething productive about the issues you and Obama talked about. Taking \nverbal jabs are a distraction for those who do not want to confront the \nreal problems. Personally I'm sad that in this country we use gossip as a \nform of defending our own personal stupidities. You know your worth and you \nknow how to have fun, and how to be a loving human. Thats more than most.\ufeff",

Certainly there are no shortages of bigots over various \nissues, and terrorism is another extreme example of today's problems. Some \ncultures are more open and positive than others, but in either case there \nare always those who feel wronged in their culture.
