The title of emperor was proposed to him by the National Assembly he \nwasn't self-declared. Also he did many things to modernize France for the \npeople, that the royalty didn't. Also he wasn't the one who declared war on \nEurope... actually it was Europe which declared war on France in many \ncoalitions... So you're just explaining a part of the story here. Napo \nwasn't the bad guy,he was the guy of the situation, who could \nhypothetically have stabilized the situation in France but also in Europe. \nHe didn't since France was vanquished at the end of the story, and the \nmonarchy returned. But his invasions and reforms game allowed new things in \nEurope.... good or bad, but certainly necessary. Sorry for the grammar :)\ufeff",

            "text": "The French Revolution was the 'big bang' of modern history, and probably \nthe most important event in human history outright. It showed people a new \nway was possible. It's why we think democracy is a good idea. It's why we \nhave human rights, constitutions, liberalism, secularism, feminism, \nsocialism -- in other words, the modern world. \n\nIt's a sad commentary on the way conservatives think that, two centuries \nafter the Revolution, their greatest criticism against it is that it was \nviolent. What a shocking thought, a violent revolution! Tell me, how did \nAmerica win independence against the British? By holding hands with King \nGeorge and singing kumbaya? No, we went to war. And when we found loyalists \nconspiring with the British, we hanged them and left their bodies dangling \nin the streets as a warning. The French Revolution was violent because it \nhad to be violent. Only violence could uproot and destroy the fundamentally \ncorrupt and corrosive system represented by the Old Regime. Violence, \ninternally and externally, is why the Revolution succeeded; it's how France \nwon the Revolutionary Wars. The ideals of the Revolution -- liberty, \nequality, fraternity -- did not spread because they were lofty and \nintellectual. They spread because the French spent a decade (and another \none later with Napoleon) kicking the living crap out of all the monarchies \nof Europe (Prussians, Austrians, Spaniards, Russians, Italians, etc). And \nonce Europe realized that the French system worked, they themselves adopted \nthe fundamental reforms instituted by Napoleon and the Revolution and used \nthose reforms to ultimately beat the French.  \n\nBelow are some of the profound consequences and aftershocks of the \nRevolution which the video did not mention:\n\n1) The independence movements in Central and South America. The reason why \ncountries like Argentina and Brazil are independent is because of the \nRevolution and Napoleon's rise to power. The Napoleonic Wars absolutely \nruined Portugal and Spain, to such an extent that the latter two did not \nhave the resources to defend their colonial empires. Within a few years \nafter the Napoleonic Wars, all of Central and South America was free. Thank \nyou French Revolution. \n\n2) The expansion of the United States. The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 more \nthan doubled the size of the United States and set America on a path of \nconquest that would last throughout the 19th century. And how did the \nFrench get the Louisiana Territory that they sold to us? They beat the crap \nout of the Spanish in the Revolutionary Wars and took it from them through \na treaty. I should also add: the Revolution made America a democracy. Our \nFounding Fathers established this country as a republic and equated \n'democracy' with 'anarchy' and mob rule. It was the French Revolution that \nmade American society consider democracy as a viable political option (the \nemergence and character of the Democratic Party under Jefferson is a direct \nconsequence of the Revolution). Thank you French Revolution.\n\n3) The rise of nationalism, worldwide. It's a quirky fact about modern \nhistory that Italy's flag was designed by Napoleon. The very reason why \nnations like Italy and Germany exist is because of the Revolution, since it \nunleashed a series of nationalist movements that we still live with today. \nThank you French Revolution.\n\n4) The impact of the Revolution had no geographical limits. It led to \nseveral wars in India, even causing Hinduism to become more conservative as \na reaction. It also led to the Haitian Revolution and to the effective \nindependence of Egypt from the Ottoman Empire. Thank you French Revolution.\n\n5) Movements for abolition and universal suffrage in the 19th century were \na direct result of the French Revolution. If you can vote and you're not \nslave, thank the Revolution!\n\nI could keep going until we're old and gray, but I've made my basic point: \nhuman life and human history are inseparable from the Revolution. Because \nof the French Revolution, our kids will believe that the future will be \nbetter than the past and that humanity is destined to do great things in \nthis universe. The Revolution gave humanity hope, plain and simple.\ufeff",

At least one \nscientist has tested this on a prisoner subject to guillotine the scientist \nDr. Beaurieux observed first natural behavior of the head reacting to the \nbeheading muscle reflexes then well attempting to communicate with the head \nobserved it responding by opening its eyes and focusing several times \nbefore eventually passing out and dying.  This was done in 1905.    In \nmodern medicine we know its possible for a limited time to keep a head \nalive Russian Scientist and a couple others over the decades have performed \ntest of graphing heads to other animals of the same species with various \nresults, in order to do so the head must be kept alive.  This is usually by \ninsuring blood flow into the brain. until the procedure is complete.  So in \nessence as the brain loses blood flow it dies.  but it seems this takes \ntime at least several seconds.    So its very possible that some \nindividuals if they didn't die from outright shock of the beheading were \npossibly at least still mentally alive for several seconds or more before \nthe brain eventually died from lack of blood flow.   We see this with \npeople who suffer heart attacks or such.  As if the heart is restarted or \nthe person isn't put on a life support system (artificial heart or \nsimilar)  the lack of blood and oxygen for a certain amount of time will \nkill and or damage the brain, too much time would result in brain  death or \nworse little brain function to the point that the person there is mentally \ndead or damaged to the point that they are mentally unable to communicate \nor interact.  essentially like damaging a computer hard drive.  Still the \nexecution type is still horrible. most are.  death by bullet is still the \nmost effective I believe.
