Feeling \nguilty, he decides to care for her daughter Cosette when she dies. \nMeanwhile, police inspector Javert who knew Valjean as a prisoner believes \nthat law-breakers cannot change for the better, and is determined to \ncapture him again. It is based on the highly successful stage play by Alain \nBoublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg, which itself was adapted from the \nnovel of the same name by Victor Hugo.\n\nThis film adaptation is from the Academy Award winning director of The \nKing's Speech, and features Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, \nAmanda Seyfried and an entire ensemble cast.
