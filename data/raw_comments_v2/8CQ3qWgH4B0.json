(or B.C.E. if you try to cut out all religious \nbacking from science) to 1 A.D (or C.E. devised in 525 A.D. but not widely \nused until 800 A.D.).\nAstronomically though 0 A.D. = 1 B.C.\n\nB.C. = Before Christ. A.D = Anno Domini (or \"Year of Our Lord\" in Latin). \nB.C.E (the alt to B.C.) = Before Common Era. C.E. (alt to A.D) = Common Era.\n\nAs for the Chinese New Year, that's just when the Chinese calendar \n(developed separately from the Julian (introduced in 46 BC, or 708 years \nafter the founding of Rome, and implemented in 45 BC) & Gregorian \n(introduced in 1582 AD as an improvement on the Julian) calendars developed \nand used in European history) notes the change of a new year.\nTechnically, December 31st & January 1st aren't always New Years Eve & New \nYears Day respectively, dependent on the calendar one uses.",
