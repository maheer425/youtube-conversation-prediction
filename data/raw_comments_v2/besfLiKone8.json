Your other choice would \nhave been the people who want to get rid of Medicaid completely (i.e., the \nRepublicans.)\n\nYou should be aware that the Affordable Care Act was originally developed \nby the Heritage Foundation, a super conservative think tank, and \nrepresentatives of the health insurance industry.  It's a conservative, \nRepublican plan.  It was only adopted by Obama because he thought the \nRepublicans would go for their own plan; but they used it to attack him any \nway.  The liberal plan would have been to go for a single payer system, \nsuch as a \"Medicare for All\" type of plan (similar to what Canada has; all \nprimary health insurance would be handled through one government \norganization while all health care providers would remain private, for \nprofit entities.  It would mean that a person who needs to see a specialist \nat the other end of the US would have full coverage to do so and would not \nbe limited to the doctors in their plan.  Not to mention is would cost a \nlot less money since there would be so much less overhead being paid for; \nfor the insurance companies, hiring armies of people to deny claims costs a \nlot!  And under such a plan, private insurance companies would still be \nallowed to sell supplementary insurance plans to those who want it.)\n\nAre you even sure that your son losing his Medicaid has anything to do with \nthe ACA and if it does, that it's the federal government's fault?  \nConsidering how many state governors are refusing to implement the ACA and \nthe Medicaid expansion, it could very well be that it's your state \ngovernment that's to blame. \n\nRich liberal?

I live in \nHolland (born and raised), at the moment the average monthly fee for a \ndecent health insurance is about 120 Euro a month and our default \ndetuctable rate is 350 Euro. Which mean we pay about 1800 Euro's a year to \nable to have most things covered. I have a friend living in the US that has \na low paying full time job. He told me he has to be pay around 400 dollars \na month and his detuctable is 3000 dollar which makes 7800 dollars a year \nbefore he actually receives something from his insurance. Here in Holland \nprior to 2000 people paid around 20 Euro's (back then in a different \ncurrency) and everyone was insured by default and you'd only have to \nstarting paying when you turned 18. People here in Holland complain about \nthe new health care systems that keeps getting more expensive every year, \nbut if you look at the system you guys have in the US we should be happy \nwith it. In countries like France, Britain and Canada people don't pay \nanything outside their taxes and are completely insured with never any \nquestions asked at hospitals, doctor's offices etc. Don't US citizens find \nit odd that in a such a modern and industrialized nation people have to pay \nsuch large fees to be able to get medical health service? Holland is just a \nsmall country so I understand the number of citizens doesn't come close to \ncomparison to the US which I think makes these things more complicated but \neven in large countries like France they do not seem to have these \nproblems.

Her family private health care policy was cancelled \nbecause of the Affordable Care Act. So she struggled through the expensive, \ntime consuming and incompetently designed Obamacare website to find a new \npolicy. While they waited for their new Obama-approved healthcare plan to \nstart she fell ill. She couldn\u2019t eat solid food. She should have gone to a \ndoctor sooner but with the Obama economy she wanted to wait until her new \ncoverage would kick in, February 2, to avoid a medical expense on a \nstrained house-hold budget.  When Julie finally got to the doctor they \nfound a badly blocked gall bladder that had become highly infected. Her \nbody went into septic shock just two days before her Obamacare policy would \nhave kicked in. Her kidneys shut down. She went to the emergency room \nwhere, after heroic efforts, a marvelous medical team managed to stabilize \nher condition. Early the next day her heart stopped beating around 4:00 \na.m. February 1st.\ufeff",

Since Boonstra\u2019s leukemia \ndiagnosis five years ago, she spent two-and-a-half years bed-ridden. If \nthat happens again, she\u2019s got a big problem.\n\nThe statement of benefits says glaucoma is not covered. Leukemia is a \ndisease that ravages every part of the body, so lack of coverage for \nglaucoma (or even dental care, which is also highly relevant for a leukemia \npatient and is also not covered) is a very serious issue.\n\nBoonstra is on five different medications to help deal with her leukemia. \nThe Blue Cross PR spokesman claimed that they are all covered. But when \nBoonstra went to fill her prescription for Loratadine \u2014 a \nprescription-level equivalent of Claritin that she uses to control \ncongestion brought on by chemotherapy \u2014 she was told that Loratadine is not \ncovered. She has not yet attempted to restock any of her other meds but she \nis already having to come with strategies to deal with that problem.\n\nThe $5,100 cap on Boonstra\u2019s out-of-pocket spending is for in-network care \nonly. If she has to go out of network, she could spend an additional \n$10,200. The \u201cfact checkers\u201d treat this as impossible because Boonstra\u2019s \ndoctor is in network, but anyone who has ever dealt with cancer would know \nthere is no way of predicting where you will have to go to find care.\n\nWhen Boonstra was first diagnosed, she had to go through a painstaking \nprocess to get approval for her chemotherapy drugs to be covered. When she \nfinally found insurance she liked, she had no problem with the chemo drugs. \nShe now says that process is starting all over again.\n\nBoonstra has already had to cut back on her bone marrow biopsies, which she \nwas having on a regular schedule she had worked out with her doctor, \nbecause she doesn\u2019t have clarification on whether these will be covered.\"",

So with a lower deductible, \nmeaning less out of pocket cost, then paying the normal insurance cost she \nis paying 13k a year minimum but paying only 12k in her maximum with this \nnew plan on a higher deductible?  Wait wait wait.  This info doesn't add \nup.  I want to see the info on this.  Say she was paying 350$ a month prior \nwith a 500 deductible.  That's 850 total a month.  Now with obamacare her \ninsurance has gone down to 200  (i know that's bullshit. everyone who \nactually was paying before and not on medicaid got a huge increase but \nlet's just go with this for arguements sake) and the deductible is now at \n1000.  Usually 500 and 1000 are the normal deductible rates for many types \nof insurance so let's just roll with it (preferably wish i had the actual \nstatistics).  So let's do the math here.  350+500=850 on her former plan. \n 200+1000=1200 on her new plan.  First off, if this were the case, how the \nhell is she saving any money at all?  Normally we always need to pay a \ndeductible before any insurance activates to take over the rest of the \ncosts.  If this were the case with her how the hell is she saving when she \nhas to pay her end of 1000 a month PLUS the 200 she pays her insurance \ncompany?  Furthermore if this were a normal person and the normal \ndeductible were 1000 and you never had a serious illness or injury but had \nto go in for meds due to bronchitis or something then how the hell is \ninsurance cheaper for you when all you're doing now is paying out of pocket \nthen paying the insurance companies because you're forced to?  Again I wish \nI had the actual figures because that quote I posted makes no sense \nwhatsoever.\ufeff",
