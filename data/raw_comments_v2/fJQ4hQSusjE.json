The \nGermans do seem to have corned the market in reliable well built cars. \nWhile we in the UK were designing and building the Allegro, Gerry was busy \nwith the Golf, no contest unfortunately. The dolomite Sprint was a \ncontemporary of the GTi, and is a great hot hatch, sans the hatch, and was \narguably more technologically advanced than the GTi, it would be another 20 \nyears b4 the golf had a 16valve DOHC engine like the Dolly Sprint had, but \nby then everyone had had enough of shitty lucas electrics that stopped \nworking after 6 months or the first heavy shower of rain, whichever came \nfirst, and bought GTi's or RS2000's. It's funny cos Peugeot, Honda and \nNissan are busily making cars in the UK, some of them in the same areas \nthat UK's own manufactures failed, and early on might have even been \nemploying some of the same ppl that had worked in UK owned car companies, \nso it shows it wasn't the work forces fault, but managements, for building \ncrap like the Maxi, Montego, Marina and Princess, Rover weren't too bad but \nwere still unreliable by German standards. The UK car and motorcycle \nindustry went from supply vehicles to half of the world, so sweet FA in \nabout 10 years. I drive German myself, have done for years, my 16 year old \nPassat estate has done more than 230, 000 miles and is still going strong. \nIronically I am just starting to get electrical faults, which are related \nto bad design and old age.\ufeff",
