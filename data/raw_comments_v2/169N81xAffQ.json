Or does it have nothing to do with.\nOr act they this way because of another factor and are attracted to the \nsame sex, because they are both attracted to the same sex.\nAnd in the heterosexual way, some men are attracted to more mannish women, \nas some women are attracted by more womanish men.\nIs attraction by more manish or womanish people has a conection with \nin-link-with-reproduction? or is it just a consequences of the normal type? \nor are these things distinct.\nWhat about the other sexualities? What about the asexuality? Are they \nattracted without wanting sex?\nAll that I know about me, being a gay is that I prefer mannish smells, \ninstead of womanish smells.\nMaybe it's the same factors, but as a gay man research a man, the \nno-possibility to reproduce with, is not a problem. Because there are \nalternative or it's not important anymore. And so what is kept is not the \nfinality of reproducing, but the means that uses reproducing to find a \npartner.\nToo many questions!!!!!!! Please answer as many as possible!!! :D\ufeff",
