Sending a video pretty much guarantees clarity. I ignore other \npeople's stories for the most part, but when I travel, I share my \nadventures with my friends on my story--and it's relatively instant. I \ndon't have to upload it on Facebook, it just pops up in my story or in my \nfriend's inbox. And it's not going to get lost in the jumble that is \nsomeone's Facebook newsfeed, which is a mess. It has uses, it depends on \nthe person.\ufeff",
