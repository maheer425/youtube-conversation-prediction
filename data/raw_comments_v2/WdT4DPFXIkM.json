I had an old straight 6 carbuerated engine in \na a car that when I started it one day it had a VERY loud tapping or \nbanging noise coming from the engine.  I shut the car off right away since \nI was afraid to keep running it like that.  The car had run fine up to that \npoint with no engine noise what so ever. This just came out of nowhere.  I \nwas young, right out of high school and didn't know much about cars.  I \nthought maybe I had a busted connecting rod or something.    I called down \nto the local car repair place and asked them what they thought it might be. \n Since it just happened all of the sudden on start up and hadn't made any \nnoise previous to this, the guy said it \"could' be carbon build up on a \nvalve or something.  He said if a piece of carbon gets stuck on a valve it \ncan make that really loud tapping/banging noise.  He suggested running a \nfull can of SeaFoam through the carbuerator and into the engine.  He said \nhave someone rev the engine up as you pour it in little by little.  He said \nit will smoke horribly with a LOT of white smoke coming out the exhaust but \nthat's just the SeaFoam burning off.  He said run the whole can through and \nreally rev it up and poor it in almost to the point of stalling the engine. \n I did that and sure enough, after the can of SeaFoam was run through, the \nnoise was gone.  The engine was fine ever since then.  I'm definitely a \nbeliever in SeaFoam after that.\ufeff",

Most just assume that white cloud \nmeans their engine got cleaned when its mostly the seafoam burning. \nFor automobiles a simple water injection system works fine. After failing a \nsmog test it was recommended I decarbonize my engine. I borrowed a fiber \noptic borescope and each piston had between 1/8-3/16\" hard carbon buildup. \nI was gonna chip it out withb long wire brushes and then vacuum it but was \nadvised the carbon would get in the rings and ruin them.Tried seafoam \ntechron and pass or dont pay but after use each had little effect by \nviewing the borescope. \nWent to home depot bought some brass needle valves pvc tubing and fittings \nand rigged up a system where I could meter in some distilled water from \nbehind the wheel while I drove. Inlet is at the pcv fitting past the \nthrottle body. \nGet the engine up to temp and at highway speeds open up a valve creating a \nvacuum leak then plug a hole in the line which sucks the water in. Theres a \nlarger diameter tube inline to act as an expansion tube to atomize the \nwater. The main tube is just 1/8\".\nTarget ratio is 1:10 water to fuel and after a few gallons of water in a \nfew weeks the pistons were all shiny clean and the engine ran smoother and \nrevved faster.\nOh and passed smog.\nThere is more to it than steam cleaning seems H2O when introduced to the \ncombustion process separates molecules which directly attack carbon \nbreaking it loose and vaporizing it before it passes through the O2 sensors \nand cats so there is no chance of damaging them.\nI left the system on and reclean it every few months and once in a while on \na hot summer day if I am going uphill with the AC on I will crack it open \nto avoid overheating but not sure the effect of that.\nYou do want to do this only when the motor is hot and never right before \nshut down (so there is no residual moisture leaking down the intake or in \nthe oil. Moisture that gets in your oil will see the water vapor burn off \nquickly if its hot)\ufeff",
