            "text": "+Brian Kenneth Kondas Brian, you are correct that abotion is legal and that \nit is currently a right of the woman carring the baby determine whether or \nnot to continue the life of the child. Slavery too was legal, as was the \nrape, torture and murder of slaves as they were legally considered property \nand therefore the owner. What I believe Rob was trying to say is that \nbecause neither the doctor peforming the abortion or the woman ordering it \ndone cannot see nor hear the unborn child kick and squirm as it is torn \napart via a suction tube, the humanity of their actions are removed and \nthey are therefore able to commit an act that they would otherwise be \nunable to do, were the child outside the womb. Rob's observation is more a \ncomparision in human nature as demonstrated via the expirement than an \nanology. The epirement itself was legal, just unethical... kinda like \nabortion   ",
