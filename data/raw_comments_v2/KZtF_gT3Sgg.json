They've all faced rejection before. But this is an \nopportunity. To prove others wrong. They don't learn real things? Define \n\"real\". Why should they learn \"real\" things? They've chosen to do it \ndifferently. Why should it bother you? And ultimately, what do you define \nas being successful? Is it rolling around in riches doing a job you hate? \nWill that make you happy? Real education is not defined by whether you can \nsolve formulas or algorithms in the span of three minutes, it is learning \nto do the things you actually want to do.
