I think cost \nand money come into play A LOT. Companies are cheap nowadays, they know \nyou're willing to buy anything with good GAS MILEAGE, ECO FRIENDLY, HYBRID, \nELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS. Style on the other hand is an afterthought, \naerodynamics might be more important. \n\nI have a 1992 Bonneville passed down from my grandfather when he passed \naway. It's a beautiful car, in perfect condition with only 70,000 miles, he \nbought it used from an old lady who barely drove it. After so many year he \ndidn't get out anymore so it sat for 12 years. Had to redo the entire fuel \nsystem and the brakes, but the car works amazingly now, the interior is \nspotless, I only take it out on the weekends, it's stored away for the \nwinter. While it's not technically a classic, I like to think it will be \none day. It was the first year of the newer body style Bonnevilles and \nrides like a dream, very quiet and comfortable. It has power seats, which \nmy new 2013 Dart doesn't even have, some stuff just amazes me.  \ufeff",
