            "text": "We live in a modern society where the media encourages and pushes \nrelationships (procreation) with propaganda techniques and euthanasia is \nprohibited completely (except for animals, as humanity values animals much \nmore than humans and understands animals psychological issues).  Back to my \npoint, this is a entirely wrong approach.  To make things illegal is to say \n\"Most people will do this.\"  Otherwise, if the majority wouldn't do this, \nthere would be no reason to prohibit something.  This stands the same with \neverything ranging from vandalism and theft to sabotage and first degree \nmurder.  \"Things are made illegal to protect society\" is the slogan, saying \nthat most people left to their own devices are chaotic and nuts enough to \ndo it all, with no emotional reaction to boot.  This means that any \nbehavior which is a threat to the well-being of modern society and the \nprogression of technology and the system, will be managed through the \nsystem.  Morality isn't always the issue, in fact, many things \nmodern-living people are forced into, are by its core, immoral.  How moral \nis mass consumption in truth?  We're forced under a consumer empire that \nmaintains the flow of an existent economy.  The same goes with suicide and \nthe notion of euthanasia.  If given the right under modern society, for \npeople to off themselves, masses of people would choose to do so, \nconsidering the state of the world.  The end result will be chaos, as when \nthe population of a modern society radically drops, law and order no longer \nhas nearly as much a stronghold.  In current times of the US, the \ndepression rate is incredibly high.  There's a variety of suggestions to \nhelp the current situation.  Psychiatric drug companies suggest prozac. \n Holistic healers suggest naturally occurring herbal drugs.  Talk \ntherapists suggest one on one discussions to help the depressed feel \nbetter.  The fighters of the drug war (who often end up losing the fight, \nas it's probably impossible to stop companies and governments) propose the \nmedicinal properties of psychedelics (cannabis, mushrooms, LSD, peyote). \n While it is true that psychedelics have healing properties, this is always \na transitory effect until people ignore what they learned and go back to \ntheir old habits that made them depressed in the first place (alcoholism, \nco-dependency, mass media consumption, etc).  Still, the thing is no one \never raises the question, \"What's causing so many people to be depressed?\" \nand address the situation.  You know, cause most people don't really care \nexcept for caring about money.  The fact of the matter is, the problems get \nworse as people keep procreating.  Overpopulation causes more social \nproblems and etc.  If you're not going to kill yourself, at the least, \navoid the exterior, play your cards right, and most importantly, never get \nin a relationship.  Never procreate (as what relationships are actually \nabout).\ufeff",

Injustice:* The only reason people look for meaning and beauty is \nbecause we know, on at least a subconscious level, that meaning and beauty \nare sparse if not completely absent from our world. Philosophy and art (and \nthus meaning and beauty) are unnecessary in a perfect world without pain or \ninjustice (Aldous Huxley makes good note of that in his famous novel Brave \nNew World). We simply wouldn't care either way: life is good. But life \nisn't good, we were thrown into a world of pain and suffering only to be \nrewarded with total annihilation in the form of death. Death is the \ngreatest injustice of all, the greatest form of suffering and above all \nthere is no meaning to be made from it. It is meaningless suffering. Other \nforms of suffering would be tolerable if it weren't for the fact that all \nof the lessons that we learned from that suffering weren't wiped out after \nwe die (because of the sure death of all living things, all of your efforts \nand triumphs over suffering will be lost). The only reason people want to \ncommit suicide is to get away from the pain and injustice of life, but as I \nnoted, death is the greatest injustice since it is the source of all other \ngreat injustices (old age, disease, war, etc. are all but symptoms and \nconsequences of death existing). So committing suicide really only \ncompounds the injustice you've already faced.  \n\n*2. Value of Life:* Value is subjective in that it originates and is only \nmade use of in a subjective (i.e. living) creature. Subjectivity is an \ninherent property of being alive, and is only found in living things. \nValue, as with all subjective concepts, in this way belongs to the living, \nand thus all that is valuable, by definition, is that which makes life \neasier or possible. This is because value \"owes\" itself to life, and the \nconcept of subjective ideas like value, justice, and morality evolved/ are \nonly there to serve the living. That makes life the most valuable \"thing\" \nin existence, since life is the benchmark that measures the value of all \nother things and is the origin of value itself. Given that it possesses \n\"ultimate\" value, life should always be preserved unless a specific life \ndoes more harm to the prospect of life continuing to exist in the long run \n(the life of a person who seeks to make life more difficult on the large \nscale has lost its value).\n\n(Sorry if the message isn't very clear (especially in the second \nparagraph), I was having trouble finding the words to properly explain what \nI mean.)\ufeff",

If life \nis merely meant to be suffering but to enjoy suffering, then why do we not \ninnately enjoy it, because of nonsense? instead we enjoy joy, thus why its \ncalled to \"enjoy\" to be in joy. to enjoy suffering is to be in denial, if \nnothing is logical and reasonable, then there must exist an opposite, a way \nof existence outside of life that is reasonable. the concept of life being \nabsurd is a contradiction in its own right, if its absurd, then there is a \nreason as to why its absurd, to be absurd, because your choices and beliefs \ncircle around what your biased human mind wants to think because it only \ncares about your belief as to why you feel the way you feel it is absurd, \nyour reason as to why its absurd is your belief or choice. my choice, is \nthat it has reason, a reasoning to reason, there is no reasoning as to why \nits absurd, as least there shouldnt be. My choice, believes that there is \ngod and an afterlife, because I was given thought to think so, there is no \nreason to have no reason, thus, there cannot be no reason and thus nothing \nis done, for all things we do in life, is given for reason, we eat, sleep \nand pray and use the restroom and clothe ourselves for one reason and that \nis to live, we were given life to live, for 0+0 cannot equal 1. C.S Lewis \nonce said, \n\n\"supposing there was no intelligence behind the universe, no creative mind. \nIn that case nobody designed my brain to be given the purpose of thinking. \nIt is merely when the atoms inside my skull happen, for physical or \nchemical reasons, to arrange in such an order that gives me as a by-product \ncalled thought. How can you trust your own thinking to be true? It is like \na milk jug hoping that when the milk splashes on the ground, it will shape \nout to be the map of london, but if I cant trust my own thinking, how can I \nfind atheistic arguments to be true? Therefore you have no reason to \nbelieve in anything, unless if I believe in God, I cannot trust thought or \nbelieve in it, so I can never use thought to disbelieve in God.\"\n\nthus saying, you can't trust or believe in a man who thinks the world is \nabsurd, for he was using thought to say it is absurd. your thought was \ngiven reason to think that. but if so, how is this world absurd if you were \ngiven thought to discover that? You cannot use absurdity to say the life is \nabsurd, because if your thought is absurd, it is not be trust. therefore, \nthe entire argument falls flat on Camus.\ufeff",

Committing suicide certainly \ndoesn't end the endless cycle of absurdity for everyone else, but it most \ncertainly takes you out of the equation.\n\nThe question, at least to me, then becomes whether we really wanna commit \nsuicide or not. Whether we don't want to revel in the absurd or not. I've \nhad a lot of fun with the absurd; this dumb, pointless world has made me \nincredibly happy at times. Of course, (in it's absurd, cyclical pattern), \nthis dumb, pointless world has made me sad and depressed and downtrodden. \nBut I do know, to a certain extent, that these are feelings, which simply \naren't permanent. I know that suicide is a rather permanent \"solution\" to \nthese temporary problems of loneliness, sadness, anxiety and the like, but \nit's still a question whether its worth killing myself over. Death is a \nwonderfully simple cureall to all human problems. (This is from a \nstandpoint that ignores all the theological hypothetical situations \nfollowing death, but...) You don't go hungry when you're dead. You don't go \nthirsty. You don't miss the company of others. You don't have to worry \nabout disease or poverty or anything like that. You don't have to worry at \nall, because you're dead.\n\nSo, is it worth it to worry about these things? I guess that would depend \nfrom person to person. There are certainly aspects of my life that I enjoy. \nWhile I'm not exactly on the level of \"amor fati\", I'm trying (amor fati, a \nsimilarly absurd concept).\n\nI'm reminded of a scene in \"Cat's Cradle\", where the protagonist and his \nwife come across a mass grave of people who all committed suicide as per \nthe instructions of their Holy Man, Bokonon. The apocalypse has come, and \nthese people, these miserable people who have never had any beauty in their \nlives, never had any reason to live, who seemingly never enjoyed a moment \nof their poor, hungry, deprived existence (except when listening to the \nwords of Bokonon), are all convinced that they should kill themselves.\n\nThe protagonist is outraged. He considers Bokonon to be an evil, cynical \ndick with no concern for the lives of others.\n\nThe protagonist's wife, on the other hand, says \"It's all so simple, that's \nall. It solves so much for so many, so simply.\" Then she asks the \nprotagonist, \"Would you wish any of these alive again, if you could?\"\ufeff",
