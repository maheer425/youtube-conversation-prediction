I cannot list the million things \nwrong with movies today, but I believe this vital aspect is missing.

But I know that \nwill never happen as long as people continue to fear individuality.\n\nThe next time you jump on Netflix or Love Film, do yourself favour & watch \na film from the 80's - there's SO many classics. And once you've watched \nthem all, watch the 70's, & then the 60's, & then the 90's! Anything but \nthe post 2000's where everything is made cheap, Fake, & disposable.\ufeff",

I have heard of Clockwork Orange's initial reception, but \nyou mention it as a stinker (instead of saying that the audience at the \ntime thought it was a stinker). I therefore thought that you actually \nconsider it a bad movie. \n\nIt's good that you acknowledge the films you have mentioned. That shows \nthat you are not just suffering from nostalgia. Your main pet peeve is the \nlack of recognisable musical scores since the year 2000, but what about \nfilms like Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean or Harry Potter? \nThey have recognisable musical scores too. Ask someone to whistle the music \nplayed in the Shire, and they'll know it just as likely as the theme to \nBTTF. A more recent example of a film with a highly recognisable soundtrack \nwould be that of The Dark Knight (a comic book hero-story, I know, but I \nwould argue that Nolan's version of Batman is more of a crime drama than a \nMarvel cartoon-esque superhero flick). \n\nHowever, you are completely right about the overuse of CGI. Ironically, I \nthink the only movie to do a good job of writing a story to show off \nspecial effects was the original Avatar. Nevertheless, I too do not see the \nneed for two sequels: Avatar was an enjoyable gimmick, not an epic. Peter \nJackson's The Hobbit, which could have been another landmark series of \nfilms, was sadly ruined by an over-emphasis on CGI (among other things).  \nThat does not mean that worthwhile films aren't being produced on a regular \nbasis, though. 2014 was actually a pretty damn good year for films IMO, \nthough Hollywood appears to be producing less of them.
