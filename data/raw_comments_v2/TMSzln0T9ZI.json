Leeming showed that countries driving on the \nleft have a lower collision rate than countries driving on the right, \nalthough he acknowledged that the sample of left-hand rule countries he had \nto work with was small, and he was very careful not to claim that his \nresults proved that the differences were due to the rule of the road.[33] \nIt has been suggested that this is partly because humans are more commonly \nright-eye dominant than left-eye dominant.[34][35][36] In left-hand \ntraffic, the predominantly better-performing right eye is used to monitor \noncoming traffic and the driver's wing mirror (side mirror). In right-hand \ntraffic, oncoming traffic and the driver's wing mirror are handled by the \npredominantly weaker left eye. In addition, it has been argued that \nleft-sided driving is safer for elderly people given the likelihood of \ntheir having visual attention deficits on the left side and the need at \nintersections to watch out for vehicles approaching on the nearside \nlane.[37]\" (That quote is taken directly from the website.
