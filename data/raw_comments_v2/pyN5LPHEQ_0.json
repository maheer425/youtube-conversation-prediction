Turns out embracing \nobsolete technology in the name of saving redundant jobs is bad economics.\n\nIt's even worse than that.

I found this Crash Course episode in particular incredibly \nenlightening (even more so than the rest).\n\nI've been quite \"angsty\" since returning from living in Denmark in 2010:\nAmong many things, I learned about how in 1973, the Danish reacted to the \noil crisis by removing their dependance on oil and the automobile, shifting \ntowards cycling. Now Denmark it is one of the best bike cities.. and cities \nin the world. I had always wondered why Canadians / Americans (besides \nbeing someone ignorant) did not adapt accordingly to this oil crisis as \nwell (Maybe because we have oil reserves of our own?)\n\nAnyways,\nThe final words of this episode make it ...more... clear. In the past \nepisodes we see how the government gains the responsibility to aid the \npeople in a time of crisis (top down) and here it seems as if, after the \ncrisis, and at the end of the 70s the opposite was understood. That each \nindividual's actions affect the whole. I think this is a very powerful \nlesson that continues to be incredibly relevant today, given the use of the \ninternet and the ability for a single voice to be heard and shared. \n\nI could go on and on about what this episode has made me realize but I'll \nkeep it to myself until I develop it in more clarity / detail.  \n\nThanks Crash Course!\nSeriously.

            "text": "The Phillips Curve also fell apart in the 1990's... though in the other \ndirection. The Phillips Curve claims high inflation = low unemployment and \nvice versa. In the 1970's we had high inflation and high unemployment. In \nthe 1990's had very *low* levels of inflation and low levels of \nunemployment.\n\nI'd also argue the 1970's might very well have been worse than the 2008 \ncrisis. The 70's saw double digit inflation and double digit unemployment \nwith interest rates hitting as high as 20%.\n\nThe 2008 crisis resulted in 10%-ish unemployment and absolutely ravaged \nhousing markets in a small number of states (California, New York, Arizona, \nNevada & Florida fared worst but states like Texas and North Dakota didn't \ntake much of a hit). But inflation never became a problem in the 2008 \ncrisis and interest rates were essentially at as close to 0 as you can get.\ufeff",
