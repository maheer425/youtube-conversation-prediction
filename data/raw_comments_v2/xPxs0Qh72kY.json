Incorrectly pluralistic or not - we gonna need to do it sooner or \nlater - everything is *made in China* and the products suck, that should be \na clandestine act of war in itself! Shoes not lasting for more than one \nmonth, zippers breaking on jackets & sweaters - & yet the 'convenient \nreplacement' zippers are once again made in China! Let's get those Chineses \nindeed... but we'd only be able to if the Obama-pandering pussy-appeaser is \nreplaced with a president that has a spine instead of trying to go down in \nhistory as the 'coolest' & 'hip' president of all time; not making \ndecisions that's best for the U.S.A. - but deciding by way of popularly \nsupported viewpoints by Americans who want the fantasy of believing there \nis a simpler way-out to making tough decisions. Which Obama loves since \nhe's more concerned about his & Michelle's *celebrity* above else. Obama \nwould leave office with the knowledge that there are dozens of Islamic \n'Sleeper-Cells' of Terrorism ready to strike within the next couple years - \nso long as Obama himself and his super-hipster wife leave office with *popularity \n& celebrity* still intact. Also, blaming the next president in command \nwould make even more *Saint-like*; wow, what courageous leader the U.S.A. \nhas at the helm of their nation! Not to mention, that he has hired, knowing \nwholly that she cannot grasp the threats that Islamic Ideology poses to the \nrest of civilization (like, you know, *civilized* nations that do not \ncondone Female genital mutilation, stoning to death women who had the \naudacity to be *raped*, pedophilia by way of arranged 'child-marriages' \n(again, a young child of female-gender, proposed to usually a wealthier \nfamily for financial benefits - it is amazing how much goats a 9 year old \nvirgin can garner for a Muslim family!), and the sheer basics that goes on \nin Islamic fundamental nations & illegally formed terror-states throughout \nthe Mid-East - immediate torture & death of homosexuals, the cutting-out of \ntongues of Coptic Christians in Egypt and beyond those borders, the \ncutting-out of tongues and eye-gouging of non-believers of Islamic faith, \nrandomly missing people found in mass-graves for reasons that can only be \ndescribed as *potential non-Islamic adherents of the *BEAUTIFUL* Muslim \nfaith of tolerance & moderate followers... mote like fanatical, \npsychopathic fundamental cult members of Islam! Anyway, we all see daily \nthe atrocities & insane violence committed by Muslims worldwide. \nObama's answer? Ignore the increasing 1-billion strong maniacs of Islamic \nJihadism; & it'll just disappear. Sure. Worked for Hitler and the NAZIS \ndidn't it? No force or war needed to stop Hitler and his NAZI soldiers... \njust a very minor skirmish called *World War 2*..\nno big deal huh?",

So, I suppose, in the name of *fairness* & *white-insults*, \nthey seemed to balance Robert Downey JR'S attempts at being an Australian \nplaying an African-American soldier in a movie that was fictional, but \nende-up being a real fictional movie in the absurd process. Nonetheless, \nRobert Downey Jr. stole the movie with his performance. Without him, the \nmovie would have been devoid of the most comically, truly best-acted \ncharacter in the movie - right alongside Ben Stiller going *Full Retard* \nfor 'Simple Jack'.\nTerrific Robert Downey Jr. Performance - I watched this movie repeatedly \njust because of Robert Downey JR's wonderful acting display!\nI am forced to consider he played the character of a 'black \nAfrican-American soldier' better, & definitely more humorous than an \nauthentic *black man* playing the character of an actor of a 'black \nsoldier' in the jungle wars of Vietnam/Cambodia.\nWhat a hilarious success Robert Downey JR's \"Australian blue-eyed, blonde \nhair, Aussie-accented, fair-whit-skinned\" playing so convincingly an \n\"African-American southern black soldier\" - so tastefully humorous, & with \nseveral *LoL* moments. \nJust a tremendous performance by RDJ to complete his amazing talented & \nskilled imitation of of what a *real southern Afro-American black soldier* \nwould act like, sound like and truly intangible have a demeanour that can \nconvince, persuade, & ultimately be a funnier character than 'the real \nthing'.\nRemember - it's not the colour of your skin, the presuppositions of \ndemeanour, or the realization of what 'one' & inevitably 'many' have gone \nthrough by way of cold-heartless experiences - Robert Downey JR provided an \nacting achievement that crosses the ethnic, colour, & religious standpoints \nthat are pre-determined by stereotypes themselves.\nCongratulations Robert Downey JR for an outstanding acting performance! ; )",
