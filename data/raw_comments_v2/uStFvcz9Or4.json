Then to get it going again you reheat the \nsolution and pump it back into the reactor and you're golden. \n\nNot to mention the \"waste\" can be used for a very wide variety of medical \nand industrial applications. \n\nOh and the amount of Thorium used is miniscule yet generates enormous \noutput. AND Thorium is a waste product of mining (especially in the US) so \nfrom decades of this we have a giant resource pool to pull from. \ufeff",

You have to use energy to \nseparate hydrogen from water in order to have the hydrogen. Then it simply \nburns with oxygen to make water again. That's like charging and discharging \na battery. It is not a source of energy; it is only a medium of exchange. \nIt would make a source of energy for a car, but it is not a 'source' when \ntalking about the planet or future civilization. There are no wells of pure \nhydrogen to tap. If there were, we might use up all of the free oxygen \nburning the hydrogen for energy. Then what would we breath? Carbon dioxide \nis part of the natural carbon cycle. We exhale CO2 and then plants take it \nin and convert it into plant materials such as sugar, oil, and cellulose. \nThey of course require light from the sun to do this. The oil produced is \nthe same as a battery in the sense it is storing energy from the sun. When \nall the oil is used up, then we will be limited to what we can produce from \ngrowing plants to obtain this stored energy. Except that we can import more \nenergy from the sun using reflecting satellites, etc.\n\n It would have been better to mention cold fusion than to bring up \nhydrogen. Now of course if you fuse the hydrogen into helium then you will \nactually produce energy from it. There are really only three sources of \nenergy: geothermal, fission, sun. All the oil got its energy from the sun. \nSure burning hydrogen produces less pollution than burning oil, but who \nsays you have to burn it? It's possible to chemically break down oil \nresulting in electricity without burning it in some kind of combustion \nengine. This can be done with any hydrocarbon. There is also a process \ncalled Thermochemical Conversion or Hydrothermal Liquefaction. Also  \nThermal depolymerization. We have the technology to convert raw sewage \ndirectly into fuel oil.\n\nReflecting additional light to the earth, or producing massive amounts of \nheat from fusion or other nuclear power heats up the planet. If anyone is \nworried about global warming, then they should be alarmed at the prospect \nof reflecting additional heat from the sun onto the earth or producing heat \non the earth from nuclear fission or fusion. Global warming is not caused \nby natural carbon dioxide; it is caused by releasing stored heat and \nkilling massive amounts of plants that would ordinarily absorb heat from \nthe sun and store it. CO2 is a gas! You can actually put out fires using \nCO2 gas. Dry ice is made from CO2. Dry ice is cold! How can something cold \ncause global *warming* ? It's patently absurd to blame CO2 for global \n*warming* .\ufeff",

If I \nwere to register all my assets with some third party registry and print my \nown currency backed by those assets, then that would be better currency \nthan the current fiat dollar.\nThere is a big problem with tying currency to an asset that may change \nvalue, and that is it: the asset changes value thus changing the value of \nthe currency. People were able to manipulate the value of currency by \nmanipulating the value of gold by flooding the market or by buying it up \nand creating an artificial shortage. But other than that, it is exactly \nlike holding the gold. If the market value of gold changes while you have \nthe gold in your hands, then that shouldn't be a problem if gold is what \nyou wanted. And if gold is not what you wanted, then why did you trade for \nthe gold? LOL\nThere is the advantage in creating a variety of currencies backed by many \ndifferent things.\nCrypto currency is an example of currency that gets its value from a \nservice that was already rendered. Somebody's computer rendered an answer \nto a complex math problem and in exchange, they got paid in cryptocurrency. \nMany problems are solved by cryptocurrency. How can the value of work \nalready performed change? It is still a loan in a way. The people who \nissued the math problem to be solved determine how much crytpocurrency they \nwill pay for the solution and they guarantee that the cryptocurrency will \nhave value by supporting a market exchange. Some authority still determines \nhow much cryptocurrency will be issued per time period and if someone wants \ntheir math to be solved by the network badly enough then they will have to \nbuy some from the market in order to pay for the services. If we run out of \nmath problems to be solved, this could result in a market crash, but if \nthere is greater demand for math problems to be solved than there is \nnetwork capacity to solve them, this could result in a greatly increased \nvaluation of the cryptocurrency. Ideally, there would be a steady value and \nthe authority will adjust how much is issued to try to achieve this.\nSince an authority is required, it is not an ideal solution. I'm still \nlooking for a free market solution that cannot be manipulated by people in \npower.\n\nIn the near future we will have self driving taxis, if they don't already \nexist. There will be fewer jobs, so more people will be unemployed or \nunderemployed. Giving them a handout is not the answer. I think it is great \nif a civilization is so efficient that it can afford to guarantee a minimum \namount of an education, food, housing, and transportation to everyone. \nPeople could still be motivated to attempt to make a positive contribution \nto such a society even when their basic needs are met. They have hobbies \nand want entertainment, and one of the ways they would go beyond merely \nexisting would be to create entertainment. Prostitution will still exist. \nThere will still be hucksters. But most importantly, people need 1. privacy \n2. respect 3. attention. People enjoy being recognized for their \ncontributions and achievements. People want to be able to afford a nice \nprivate house as opposed to a projects apartment. People enjoy respect as a \nteacher, professor, scientist, police officer, politician, lawyer, judge, \nplumber, etc. Name a specialized occupation and there is a stereotype about \nit. Used car salesman may not be the most respected job title, but people \nwould rather say they sell cars than say they do nothing. It's just part of \nbeing social to ask 'what do you do?' It's a common question because people \nself identify by their occupation. They are devestated and go through a \nlife crisis when they are terminated due to being redundant. Even if all \ntheir bills get paid, just having that job title is important to them.\n\nHere is what I see happening. People will be given jobs controlling robots \nremotely from a computer terminal. They will earn the crytpcurrency \nequivalent of Farmbucks for remotely controlling an agriculture robot to \nharvest tomatoes or some other delicate crop that requires some \nintelligence to pick. Everyone will have a job, although those with more \nintelligence will have a title worth more esteem. If there are not enough \nreal jobs, then those with the lowest level of trust will get simulated \njobs. We don't want disgruntled people crashing a harvester into the pond, \nso managers constantly monitor the moods of the operators and have the \nability to switch them over to a simulation if they haven't had enough \nsleep or there is some other personal problem. The main goal is 100% \nemployment rate and thus the highest quality of life possible for everyone \nwithout any moochers.",

            "text": "+Derek Decker\nIt's a false bifurcation to suggest that there are only two extremes: 1. \ncrony capitalism with a few elites controlling the money supply or 2. \nMarxism with a few elites controlling the distribution of resources.\nNeither of these extremes is equitable or just.\n\nSome people actually do become doctors because they want to help people. \nThe accumulation of wealth is highly over-rated. Many people seek positions \nof prestige, as a general, a politician or as a scientist for the prestige. \nSocial recognition is an oft overlooked or misunderstood motivating factor.\nMany people seek military rank or political clout for the power. Being in a \nposition of authority has many rewards, even without the cronyism. Being \nable to funnel public resources into the hands of ones personal friends is \none benefit that should be highly regulated and highly transparent.\n\nAbout a hundred years ago, the U.S. Congress got together and decided to \nplace the power to create money from nothing into private hands when they \ncreated the Federal Reserve Bank, a banking cartel. Since then, the cronies \nof the people who run that organization were able to have access to \nvirtually unlimited funds with which they bought up real assets with their \nborrowed fiat currency. Today less than three hundred people own more than \nhalf the wealth of the U.S. These greedy hoarders are creating artificial \nshortages which result in the stagnation of the economy.\nIt is clear that putting so much power in the hands of a few is detrimental \nto the progress of humanity.\nA better solution would be to abolish the Federal Reserve and allow every \nindividual to create his own legal currency, much the way things used to \nbe. People used to buy merchandise on credit by simply writing an I.O.U. \nrather than begging for the mercy of the banksters. Being able to exchange \npaper, whether it is an I.O.U., a contract, or a currency, is a tremendous \nconvenience and far superior to direct barter and immediate exchange of \ngoods. I don't think anyone wants to see things go backwards. However, \ncurrency that is created from nothing, not backed by anything, and only \ntrusted by tradition which originated with a currency backed by precious \nmetals, has too many flaws. The greatest flaw is that each time the \nbanksters lend more money to their cronies with which they flood the market \nwith more money, they cause inflation to happen. This means that when the \ncronies pay back the loan, they are paying back less value than they \nborrowed. On the other hand, people who are working for a paycheck will \nfind the money they agreed to on Monday is not worth the same amount by the \ntime they get paid on Friday. Inflation is a tax that takes value from the \nworking class and puts it in the pockets of the banksters and their cronies.\nCapitalism is great. It is crony capitalism and the fiat currency that is \nholding back progress.",

To get this wealth, one had to \noutperform other peoples, governments, and societies. In turn, new better \ntechnology is created. \n   So yes, we can have a society that mirrors the Natives but we would have \na fraction of the technological advances that we have today. I do not \nbelieve that in the society you explained there could be a chance to even \ncreate flying cars and a cure for cancer.
