But this time everything is actually \nreal life its like in between a dream and real life because I swear to god \nit was real life... anyways I wake up and am sitting down on my bed except \nI cant move I try to scream because my brothers were there but I couldn't \nscream.... then I try moving my head left it was hard but I did it... \nanyways I see this floating girl with raggedy clothes flying I start going \ncrazy but I cant move and then it flys towards me inside my mouth and I \nfall back to my bed and go to sleep and then I cant remember what happened.\n\nFive: I was being chased by alien spaceships and I was doing parkour even \nthough I didn't know what parkour was at the time... anyways im going under \npoles doing some sick moves doing some cat leaps and shit then I see my \nbrothers and family running along and I think the aliens shoot down my \nbrother and I keep running and then at the end they pulverize me and I wake \nup....\n\nSix: I pulled out my hand and did the spiderman slingshot thing but then \nwhen I look at the web its just a tiny skinny flimsy line flying in the air \ngoing up and down because it is just floating... I hated this dream because \nI really wanted to be spiderman and all I got was a fucking flimsy thread \nand I knew I was dreaming at the time but I couldn't control \neverything..... all I could do was shoot flimsy threads.....\n\nSeven: I was in like a horror movie sscene skipping thing... sooo the first \nsight I saw were like zombies and stuff and im like wait this is a dream so \nI blink hard and I just pop up on another horrible dream then im like shit \nwhy do they keep changing... then I blink again and the dream goes from one \nterrifying thing to another.... the only thing is that I knew I was \ndreaming but I couldn't control that much and yes I chose not to wake up \njust because I thought I could control if I kept trying.\ufeff",

All I \nknow is that I tested in my dreams if I was still dreaming - because I \nremember trying to flip on switches in the house so I could see where I was \nwalking, but nothing worked! I could have very well been sleep walking and \nhaving a lucid dream at the same time. Is that possible? I remember seeing \ntwo forms of the same house as I was walking through it, being able to \nswitch from one version of each room to the other as I was walking. It was \nfascinating! I could change each and every room exactly how I wanted it. \nUntil the part where I started losing control of how the house looked. One \nversion looked like something straight out of an insane asylum, and the \nother turned all nature-y! I would constantly check to see if I was still \ndreaming - the time on my clock always switched from 6:15, to 8:15 and back \nagain to 6:15! It was freaky, horrible, cool and all around amazing!!\nThoughts on this crazy accurance??\ufeff",
