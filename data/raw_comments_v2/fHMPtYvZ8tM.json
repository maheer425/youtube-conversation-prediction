I think that baby alone is \nreason enough for me to be pretty damn near straight edge. I am also \nCanadian, and born in Canada, so there is some debate about whether I could \never be Scottish. \n\nAll of that being said, I would let our sons read your books at possibly \nany age (after I read them myself because I would currently be reading them \nif I wasn't struggling with Life of Pi and trying to figure out how a rat's \nanus is a vital piece of imagery that Yann Martel decided any and all \nreaders required. If I wasn't able to put a meaning behind that scene with \nthe rat, the detail of that rat's anus would probably be the only thing I \ntake from that book. That, and my argument against his Agnostic statements. \nI'm only half way, though, so we'll see how this goes. Read Fight Club in \nthree days. It's been... Weeks with this book.

That being said, I like the solution the school came up with, for \nany book that might be controversial.  That way individual parents can \ndecide. Although I also think the  PARENTS should be required to read the \nbook in question too so they don't jump to stupid conclusions based on what \nthey've heard about the book through the grapevine.  Read and think for \nyourselves, people! Or at the very least trust that your kids are smart \nenough to know the difference between real life and a novel. What really \nburns me up though, is when certain people (some of which don't even have \nkids at that grade level or no kids at all.) decide that their opinions \nabout a book they may or may not have even read (usually not) outweigh the \nopinions of the parents who are okay with their kid reading it.  Quit \ntrying to parent other people's children! If you don't want your kids to \nread it, that's between you and your kid.  Talk to the teacher and see if \nthey can do something else. But for the love of reading, don't try to take \naway an opportunity to read a good book away from other kids! I know this \nvideo is older, and I'm glad it got resolved, but the same issue is still \ngoing on with other books and it still turns me into a Giant Squid of \nAnger! Although, I will say there is one small upside: the more you forbid \nyour kids to read something, the more they will want to read it.  Just \nsaying.   I had a friend in middle school, her parents wouldn't let her \nread Harry Potter so I let her borrow my HP books all throughout middle and \nhigh school and she read them in secret.  Mostly just to spite her parents \nand see what all the hype was about at first, but it didn't take her long \nto fall in love with the series. Yeah...I aided a friend in disobeying her \nparents, and I'm proud of it.  She didn't turn into a Satan-worshipping \ncult leader from reading them either so no harm done :)\ufeff",

In this book, a rich guy of the 19th century falls in love \n(and has sex) with with a young lady that later in the book discouvers to \nbe his long lost sister. Everyone in the 11th in the whole country has to \nread it, and it's a loyal portrait of the portuguese society back in the \nday, comic and beatifully written, even tough some parts of it are \ncontroversial. My point is that Looking for Alaska isn't at any moment of \nthe story pornographic. Its an amazing book and the bits that are \ncontroversial are there for a reason, to teach us teens that emocional \nconnections are way more important that phisical ones... If a teen can read \nthe Maias with a critical look, than a teen can certainly read Looking for \nAlaska and understand why the sex scene is there.\ufeff",

My problem is how little you seem \nto understand the argument that these people are putting forth.\n\nTheir position is that there are certain topics that are inherently \ntitillating, no matter what you try to do to make them not so. If there was \na movie version of this particular book, and the details of the scene in \nquestion were actually shown, it would be rated R or above. It wouldn't \nmatter that the scene was not supposed to be titillating.\n\nThese are the people who believe nudity is porn, full stop. That is why \nthey are referring to your book as porn--they see it as the equivalent of \nshowing the subject in question on screen--and that subject was the \nmechanical acts of a form of sexual intercourse. They believe such \ndescriptions are inherently titillating.\n\nAgain, I repeat--I agree wholeheartedly that these people were wrong to try \nand ban your book. The most they had the right to do was prevent their own \nchildren from being required to read it. But I don't think their point is \nwhat you portrayed it to be--that teens are too stupid to know the \ndifference. They just object to titillation in general. And they think what \nyou discuss in your book is inherently titillating--and thus, porn.\ufeff",
