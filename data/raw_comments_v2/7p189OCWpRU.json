Try to give \nother religious people a chance by giving them the benefit of the doubt. \nDont expect them to judge you right away,  merely on the basis that they \nconsider themselves as part of a certain religion. There are many people, \nand i can also say that out of experience, that do not follow their \nreligion very dogmatically. There are people with alternative views and \npeople who interpret their scriptures differently. Especially within islam, \nthere is a tremendous amout of diversity around the world and within \ncommunities as well. Especailly since there is no authority within Islam. \nNobody defines who is a muslim, and who is not. Some might claim there is \nonly 1 way to be a muslim, but you will surely find many who disagree as \nwell. This is both a strength and a weakness in my opinion.

But in \ntruth that is just a fact that is used in favor of those people from a \nstandpoint of statistics. There are far too many people who believe in \nreligion to say that EVERY one of them has this opinion of non-believers \nbecause it is statistically improbable so I will give you that.\n\nHowever, with my experiences I can bring to you evidence that cannot be \nproven online but clearly supports my claim of these people judging others. \nI have a religious background, my parents are super religious and so are my \ngrandparents and so on. I know the inner workings of a religious family so \nI can tell you, with my experience, that these people judge you.\n\nNow of course you can say that my family's religion is just one out of the \nmany religions, but lets take a step back and examine what religion is. \nRemember, no matter what the religion is they all have a common theme. Do \nthis, don't do that, feel this, don't feel that, believe in this, don't \nworry about that and you will be granted eternal life/saving/salvation/ \nwhatever else your aiming for. Think of all the major religions and tell me \nwhich one doesn't vaguely follow those guidelines?\n\nA religion is not a way of life, those two things are separate. A way of \nlife is different than a religion because a way of life doesn't tell you \nwhat your suppose to do. Those who live a certain way don't judge others, \nunless their way of life is to judge others lol.... But religion tells you \nexactly what to do and what not to do.\n\nThose who are religious DO judge those who do not have a religion or who \nhave a different belief simply because religious people are foreign to any \nideas that arise from areas that are not sourced from the same place as \ntheir beliefs. In other words, if you don't agree with them on what they \nbelieve, then they will judge you based on what you believe. I may not have \nany evidence that has been published in any journal of science or such but \nwhat I do have are my own experiences. Learn from them as you may, but know \nthat you will have to do your own research and have your own experiences \nwith these people to know the truth, I am just a messenger conveying my \nthoughts..",

I think we both agree on that. However, i do think you make some \narguable statements. When you say that religious people are ''secretly \njuding you'', that statement is based on nothing,  except some assumption \nyou have. It's a statement that you could only make if you met every single \nreligious person on earth, and if you would know them very well, and even \nthen it would be hard to make that statement.  Regarding this man, I really \ndo not think he believes you HAVE to be religious in order to be the way he \ndescribes. I think the message he is trying to get across is just that as a \nmuslim, he believes he is commanded to act this way. But again, this is the \nimpression i got from this speach. We wouldnt know unless we ask him. (and \neven when we ask him, it is possible that what he tells us, is not what he \nis ACTUALLY trying to accomplish)",

That is \nwhy mentioned religion. Because if you are religious, then you believe in \nsomething and you think that you must believe in order to \"be saved\" and \nany other form of that. That is why when it comes to religious people, you \nare either with them or not. They are bias in how they look at you.

It will be called the noraK and it will have the following verses:\n\nnoraK: 8:55: \"Surely the vilest of animals in God's sight are Muslims\"\n\nnoraK:8:65 \"O Prophet, urge the faithful to fight. If there are twenty \namong you with determination they will vanquish two hundred; if there are a \nhundred then they will slaughter a thousand Muslims, for the Muslims are a \npeople devoid of understanding.\" \n\nnoraK:8:39 \"So fight them until there is no more Islam and all submit to \nthe another religion and Islam is destroyed (in the whole world).\" \n\nnoraK:9:5 \"Fight and kill the Muslims wherever you find them, take them \ncaptive, harass them, lie in wait and ambush them using every stratagem of \nwar.\" \n\nnoraK:9:29 \"Fight those Muslims who believe until they all surrender, \npaying the extortion tax in submission.\" \n\nnoraK:9:123 \"Fight the Muslims around you, and let them find harshness in \nyou.\" \n\nThat is how we view your Koran (in reverse), and the narratives in the \nHadith confirm the doctrine.\n\nSo if you believe Islam is a race defined by your Koran, then you are a \nbigotted and racist person, and I would have no problem defending against \nyou as an existential threat.\n\nPlease do not define Islam as a race, for the benefit of those who want to \nassimilate into western society. For me, Islam the doctrine is an \nexistential threat to my culture and my way of life. I want to be \naccommodating to immigrant Muslims, but I see VERY clearly how religious \nminorities are treated in Islamic majority countries. \n\nThe silence of the Byzantine Christians, the Afghanistan Buddhists, the \nPakistani Hindus, the Zoroastrian Persians all speak very loudly in my new \nholy book.",
