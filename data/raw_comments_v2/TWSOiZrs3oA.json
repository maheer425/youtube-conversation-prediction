You're expecting fast food to hold  up against properly \nprepared food? \n\nI know hard shelled tacos are essentially non-existent in Mexico, but a \ngood Mexican chef could probably create a hard shelled one with authentic, \nquality taste. Using real cheese and quality meats as opposed to the \nplastic and sand that Taco Bell uses might also make these decidedly \nnon-authentic food concepts more appealing to Mexican natives.\n\nI remember the video of Chinese people trying Chinese-American foods. The \nconsensus seemed to be \"it's not Chinese but decent\". All I see here is \nMexican people trying fast food. I'd like to see them give their opinions \nof food from a decent Mexican-American restaurant in the Southwest. That \nwould be give us a better understanding of cultural taste differences. \n\nThat said, I loved the Mexican-American food when I lived in Nevada. Living \nback in the Northeast, all I can say is we need to pass a constitutional \namendment barring white people from working in Mexican kitchens. Even if it \nwas Americanized, the food that the Mexican-Americans put out was \nabsolutely amazing. Bright, incredible flavors.\ufeff",
