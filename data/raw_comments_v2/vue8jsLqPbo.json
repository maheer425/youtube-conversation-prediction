            "text": "+Cameron Seebach\n {You seem to be denying the evolution of new species}\n\nThis statement is one which cannot be responded to with the simplicity of \neither yes or no. That's due to the fact that a problem is caused by the \nword \"species\". In fact, within Biology, it's referred to as the \"species \nproblem\"\n\nNotice, I said that humans can't give birth to anything other than humans \nand the example I used for animals was that canines can't give birth to \nanything other than canines.\n\nNevertheless, a variety of different canines can be, and have been, \ndescended from a particularly specific canine. All canines have descended \nfrom Canis Lupus (Wolf). This is simply the result of micro evolution, \ni.e., variation...which does occur. Therefor, considering that Taxonomy \ncategorizes Wolf, Coyote, Fox, Dingo etc. as each one a distinct species, \nthen my response is, no, I don't deny the (micro) evolution of new species.\n\nHowever, evolutionists claim that \"speciation\" occurs, with the implication \nbeing that it proves macro evolution. Thus, whenever the word \"species\" is \nused in this manner, then my response is, yes, I do deny the evolution of \nnew species\n\nBut my two different responses to the same word is not causing the problem. \nBut rather, evolutionists are causing the problem by using the word \nspecies, while remaining oblivious to the \"species problem\"\n\nThis is what you need to know...evolutionists explain that whenever a \npopulation of organisms separate from a greater population, biological \nchanges may occur while living in a different environment. Thus, if members \nof the break away population attempt to interbreed with members of the \noriginal, parent population, they'll be incapable, due to the biological \nchanges. Or if they can successfully interbreed, but cannot produce viable \noffspring, then it is said, from either scenario, that \"speciation\" has \noccurred\n\nThis is the explanation of \"speciation\" and the same explanation is \npresented as the standardized definition of the word \"species\". However, \nthe problem is that there exist animals, such as, various species of \ncanines that can interbreed and produce viable offspring. Also, every \nexample presented by evolutionists as the occurrence of speciation, is \nmerely another occurrence of variation. The Salamanders are still \nSalamanders etc. etc. etc.\n\nThe fact is that the validity of \"speciation\" is completely dependent upon \nthe existence of a standardized definition of the word \"species\". No such \ndefinition exists and within the scientific field of Biology, this is known \nas the \"species problem\"",

It postulates that after a number of random mutations have become \npart of a greater population, a particular mutational morphologic change \nmay enable its recipient organism to survive a new, hostile environment \nthat has killed the entire rest of the population\n\nThe fact is, mutations are reproductive defects. Thus, they are not better \nsuited, than are correctly reproduced organisms, for overcoming life \nthreatening, biological adversities. Mutations are, themselves, a \nbiological adversity\n\nThis is why, for as long as man has been observing mutants within nature, \nevery time its been observed that they're the first to die. They don't \nsurvive even ideal environmental conditions...much less, conditions hostile \nto their species\n\nListen, everyone on Earth knows that there doesn't exist even one human \nthat can give birth to something other than a human. Every reproductive \nhuman can give birth to only another human and nothing else. It's a hard \nrule of Biology & it cannot be broken. Biologists know in detail, the \nspecific reasons why reproductive systems are subject to this hard rule\n\nTherefor now, consider a pair of human mates that reproduce, They, being \nhumans, are subject to this hard rule of Biology. Thus, they necessarily \ngive birth to a human. That offspring, being human, is also subject to the \nsame, unbreakable, hard rule of Biology. Thus, he necessarily reproduces \nanother human offspring. Now we're up to the third generation and the same \nhard rule applies to him because of his humanity\n\nYou can continue that reproductive line for thousands or millions of years \nand the results will never change because the cycle is one of continual \nself perpetuation. This unbreakable, hard rule of Biology continually \nperpetuates itself upon every generation, causing the neverending \nperpetuation of only human offspring\n\nThis reproductive hard rule applies, not only to humans, but also, to all \nother biological organisms. Canines cannot give birth to something other \nthan Canines...etc. etc etc.\n\nThus, we find, scientifically, that each must come forth after their own \nkind",

Its kind of like having fun \nwith those will mental or psychological disabilites and that its not only \nOK to do so, but right to take advantage of it at such people's expense.  \nNo, I don't think I'm being over sensitive.  Its an observation and a fair \none.  Its the return of the 'circus geek', Todd Browning's 'pin heads', \nIrkle and Gleason's \"Crazy Googanhan\".  But we cannot be social facists and \nthought police. We cannot force \"social acceptability\".  It is still a \nguaranteed right of Free Speech to \"hurt someone's feelings\" and not 'hate \nspeech\" (whatever that means).  And education to 'sensivity' and draconian \npolitical law- a form of hate itself- backing it is wrong, wrong and \nwrong.  I am one who has that Aspbergers dioagnosis and have done things \nabout it to make myself happier in this world with friends, love, \nexperiences, gaining social graces, to improving interpersonal \ncommunications, to sharing my talents and contrtibuting what I could.  Now, \nif we could only get off this kick of renaming 'social epithets' with \n'diagnostic eponyms' and visa versa, it would be a great beginning.  We \nmust also remember that Prof. Kaku is a Physicist and neither a \nPsychologist or Neurologist.  His is yet, as mine is, merely his opinion.  \n(And I am a huge fan).\ufeff",
