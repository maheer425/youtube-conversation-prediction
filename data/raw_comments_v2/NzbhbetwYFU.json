He was famous for his remarkable \ncontrol of the abdominal muscles, which enabled him to seemingly fart at \nwill. His stage name combines the French verb p\u00e9ter, \"to fart\" with the \n-mane, \"-maniac\" suffix, which translates to \"fartomaniac\". The profession \nis also referred to as \"flatulist\", \"farteur\", or \"fartiste\".[1]*\ufeff",
