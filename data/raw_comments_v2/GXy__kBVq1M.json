These people don't see the real \nreason behind someone wanting a better life/being more successful. I \nstarted a law degree three years ago and in a few weeks away from my last \nexams. Going for this degree was the best decision that I could have ever \nmade and opens up so many opportunities for me. Every good grade I got for \nan assignment or exam, every good word from my teachers, every \nbrainstorming session with my classmates and every good word from those who \nsupport and understand me make me happy. What makes me said is those people \nwho tell me that I'm unhappy just because I have a goal in life. They tend \nto misunderstand the happiness advantage theory and turn it into something \nreally negative. The most painful moments for me were when people didn't \nunderstand what I was doing and why I was doing it and told me \"oh you're \nunhappy\" or \"why do you have to study again\" or \"look at this girl, she \ngave up law degree to become a bartender\" or \"I don't want to be with you \nbecause you are on a different level and instead I choose someone who is \nmuch sillier than you\". These people don't understand what I want. Everyone \nhas the right to bring out the best in their life and if that means they \nhave to do a degree for it, they shouldn't be bashed for their goals. \nBecause you can still have your happiness advantage while you're fighting \nfor a goal in your life: the friends that support you, the teachers (who \nare your role models at the same time) who say \"yes, you'll get to your \nPhD\", every success you reach, the handsome and intelligent guy that tells \nyou \"I chose you because you're the smartest of them all\". There are so \nmany things to be happy for even if you are doing something for a future \ngoal. Don't look down on those who are trying to improve and want to be \nwell-educated and successful.\ufeff",

            "text": "*Positive Psychology - introduction via TEDx talk*\n\nThis TEDx talk I saw in 2011 was one of the more memorable talks I've \nwatched. (Perhaps because I had it at the top of my \"Watch Later\" ever \nsince, rewatching it a couple of times but not removing it. With the \nwriting of this comment, I'm going to finally bump it off my list.) It's \nhumorous and worth a watch, if you haven't seen it already (with 9 million \nviews claimed at \nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/shawn_achor_the_happy_secret_to_better_work you \nmight have seen it already).\n\nOne data point explaining the value of positive psychology is at 8:14: *\"Only \n25% of job successes are predicted by IQ. 75% of job successes are \npredicted by your optimism levels, your social support, and your ability to \nsee stress as a challenge instead of as a threat.\"*\n\nAs soon as anyone talks about \"be positive\" however, I also think of the \n\"tyranny of positivity\" as a counterpoint. There are good ways to pursue a \npositive outlook, but there are also bad ways of propagating the \"be \npositive\" meme which can backfire and oppress. More on that some other day, \nbut in the meantime I simply keep the counterpoint in mind.\n\nAt 9:25 he shares the common \"formula for success\", which is also found in \nthe \"Protestant work ethic\" (\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic) - might be a key \nreason why it's so common. It's not a bad thing in and of itself, but \ninsufficient, certainly not a source of happiness.\n\nAfter explaining the advantages one gets from happiness, Shawn Achor shares \nsome ways in which we can train our brains for them to maintain a better \noutlook (from 11:08): with \"only 2 minutes a day for 21 days\". Bullet \npoints serve as a reminder, watch the video for the details:\n\n- 3 Gratitudes\n- Journalling one positive experience daily\n- Exercise\n- Mediation\n- Random acts of kindness\n\nAlso memorable from this talk was the \"outliers\" detail described from 3:00 \n- which speaks to the question of the limits of \"average person\" scientific \nstudies. How often are our studies ignoring interesting and valuable \ninsights that could be gained by looking at statistical outliers, instead \nof eliminating them to find the \"representative average\"? (In medicine, I \nguess addressing this problem is a key dream of \"personalised medicine\".)\n\n#fb\ufeff",
