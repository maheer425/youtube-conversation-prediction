It was mostly \noriginal w/ the heavy cast iron flat head four engine and 3 speed crash box \ndrive train.  Those wagons are a great size, good visibility and a classic \nlook, what is not to like?  I normally hate the idea of altering a classic, \nbut yours was already butchered, if it were me, to make it a good boondocks \ntraveler, I would replace just about every mechanical system: install a \nmuch lighter (and more reliable) Toyota all aluminum EFI V-6 and a manual \ntrans and drive train; than junk the useless suicide drum brakes and \ninstall modern power disks, and use the Toyota power steering system as \nwell.  dump the heavy and sloppy leaf spring suspension for a 4 bar,/coil \nspring suspension (it will lower the risk of a roll over, and improve the \nride and handling considerably).  round out with good modern bucket seats \nwith seat belts, full instrument cluster, insulation and new interior \nfinish, halogen head lights; and than you will have a lighter, safer, more \nreliable and comfortable outback rig. I learned by experiance (thanks to \nthat sloppy leaf spring suspension) that the Willis wagon body is strong \nenough to take a full roll over without any reinforcement (and remarkably \nlittle damage), so a roll cage should not be necessary for anything but off \nroad racing.  though the chassis frame could reinforced for good handling \nand durability.  Get a wrecked Toyota Tacoma at an auction for your source \nof parts.  Toyota parts are very well made, plentiful and cheap, and darn \nreliable. The perfect way to modernize an old classic.\ufeff",
