The internet has worked to create \nwealth, inform the uniformed, give a voice to small people, and is arguably \nthe greatest invention in Human history. It has worked just fine without \ngovernment control and now they will wreck it like everything else they \ntouch. This is why I must leave YouTube and sell my Google stock (both \nshare classes) :'( I think government is just livid that they didn't invent \nthe internet themselves.
