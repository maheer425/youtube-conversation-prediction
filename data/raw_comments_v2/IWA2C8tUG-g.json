            "text": "Here's a couple of tips and tricks with Vel'koz for any inspiring vel'koz \nmains/players. One thing to keep in mind that if all of his abilities land \nsuccesfully including both ticks of w and full channel ult on enemy, it \nwill bring 9 stacks of vel's passive which will in result trigger his \npassive 3 times which is alot of damage. Also if play with smartcast, you \ncan use vel's abilities together if u hit both buttons together. This only \nworks with two abilities at a time and does not work in conjuction with his \nulty. This useful when poking so u can hit Q+W to make an easier time for \nthe second part of w to hit both times to ensure a passive trigger, also do \nNOT build mana on vel'koz, bulding a tear/rod of ages denies the early \ndamage potential of vel with weak items and his mana costs are generally \nsmall especially his q, mana regen will suffic. Focus more on magic pen \nsuch as a haunting guise first than grab deathcap or morello's/athene's for \ncdr and mana regen. Maxing Q is ideal for poking and kill pressure but if \nyou are being pushed in by the enemy or can't play aggresive because of \nenemy jungler pressure maxing w will lower your kill pressure but will \ncarry you into mid game with high farm. Finally, don't forget that \nobjective as Vel'koz similar to most AP mages requires you kill off \ncarries/high prioreity targets, NOT hit as many people as possible. A 4 Man \nvel ult 4 weak members would not be as effective as killing that one fed AP \nkatarina. \n\nGood Day to You and play this Squidy\ufeff",

Q = slow moving, weird symbol that shows max range to the opponent\n2. W = low base dmg unless both ticks per cast hit, second tick has 1 sec \ndelay\n3. E = Small radius, 1 sec delay\n4. R = Slow turn rate, full dmg and passive applications takes nearly 3 \nseconds to apply and is channeled, thus any hard cc disables it, and \nZhonyas can completely nullify its dmg\n\n\n\nMy point here is that while Vel'koz is an epicly designed \nchampion......other champs nuke teams more CONSISTENTLY, consistency with \nskill is what wins any competitive game, casual or otherwise\nGood day",

He has high burst with great zone, decent DPS for the burst he \nhas, has a decent autoattack animation making harass and last-hits easy, \nand to top it all, has a nuke ult. I'm not trying to argue that mid is his \nbest lane, but I feel (after having played him mid in numerous games) he \nhas large amount of potential in the lane, and as such, it confuses me why \nwe don't see more of him.\n\nNot in the LCS per say. Every mid in the LCS nowadays either has insane \nmobility or is named Xerath/Orianna. Come on; the Syndra nerf was bad, but \nit was also SYNDRA. She was begging for a nerf.",
