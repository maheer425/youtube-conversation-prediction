This is \nfrom this story that the word \"sodomy\" (anal-sex) was born.\nSo basically every monotheist religion said that homosexuality was wrong \nand should be punished, thats why religious people hate on gay people... \nit's just written in the books.\nYou may don't like \"angry atheists\", but most of the time they are the \npeople who work for the acceptance of homosexuality.",
