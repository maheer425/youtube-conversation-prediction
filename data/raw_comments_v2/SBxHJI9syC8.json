In all honesty \ni can't really see a 5 year old actually being able to damage an adult \n(barring genital shots), even if they jumped on your head i doubt it would \nhurt much. Most adult men could beat 5 year olds up all day, until they \nreached exhaustion, then and only then, would the kids win. This all \ndepends on how the kids attack you as well, if they mobbed you like ants it \nwould be much harder than if they attacked you in two's or three's, so the \nquestion is a bit flawed in that respect. And yes, when i was 13 i knew \nother kids my age who could beat adults one on one in a fight, let alone in \na mob, four should take down an adult pretty easily.",
