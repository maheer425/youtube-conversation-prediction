Don't forget that chocolate \nmelts at body temperature. \n\nA microwave works differently from an oven. It cooks from the inside out \ninstead of the outside in, like a conventional oven does. \n\nThe warmth nerves are a little bit beneath the surface of our skin. Great \nat sensing warmth from the air and the outside world, but they can't sense \na rise in body temperature. \n\nIf anything, the scientist would feel cold since the room temperature \ndropped relative to his body (which actually rose in temperature). He might \neven have felt a bit feverish, but this is more than enough to melt \nchocolate.",

            "text": "+singingfrog I just looked it up (Thank God for the Internet) In 1894 Dr. \nJohn Harvey Kellogg was superintendent of a famous hospital and health spa \nin Battle Creek, Michigan. His younger brother, Will Keith Kellogg, was the \nbusiness manager. The hospital stressed healthful living and kept its \npatients on a diet that eliminated caffeine, meat, alcohol, and tobacco. \nThe brothers invented many foods that were made from grains, including a \ncoffee substitute and a type of granola, which they forced through rollers \nand rolled into long sheets of dough. One day, after cooking some wheat, \nthe men were called away. When they finally returned, the wheat had become \nstale. They decided to force the tempered grain through the rollers anyway.\n\nSurprisingly, the grain did not come out in long sheets of dough. Instead \neach wheat berry was flattened and came out as a thin flake. The brothers \nbaked the flakes and were delighted with their new invention. They realized \nthey had discovered a new and delicious cereal, but they had no way of \nknowing they had accidentally invented a whole new industry. Will Keith \nKellogg eventually opened his own cereal business, and its most famous \nproduct is still sold today:\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1906 that Kellogg\u2019s\u00ae Corn Flakes were made available to the \ngeneral public. In 1909, the very first cereal premium was offered: The \nFunny Jungleland Moving Pictures Booklet available with the purchase of 2 \npackages. The offer was available for twenty-three years!\nT",
