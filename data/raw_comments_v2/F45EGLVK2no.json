Won't mention names but generally foreigners \ntend to get grouped all in the same bowl of soup. It's annoying certainlly \nbut then again. \n\nAs the video points out. Seeing a foreigner is not as common. So people's \ndefence mechanism kicks in. What if they try asking me for directions? \n\nMy English is no so good and then the all important saving face take over. \nWhich basically at that point all is lost. So your better off just walking \naway. \n\nNo easy solution to this and in fact is the biggest challenge to \ninternational public relations we have. Communication or there lack of.\n\nIs what creates 90% of our problems with other nations. The rest being \ncaught up within the media propergandia machine. Finding a convenient way \nfor governments.\n\nTo take focus off their own domestic policies. It's a huge almost \ninsurmountable challenge. But one which we all play a part in helping to \nchange. \n\nPeople just don't understand the complex contexts of speach. In how they \nplay into every aspect of society. Most gets lost in translation.\n\nThen things just spiral down from there. I try to use a little reverse \npsychology when dealing with this. If a Korean says you look funny. \n\nI say do you have a recommendation on a good plastic surgeon lol. I can \nstand a face lift i guess. That usually gets a good laugh. \n\nAlways try to turn a negitive situation into a possitive one. You have to \nhave somewhat of a thick skin so to speak. However it also gives you a good \nopportunity to make a good impression. I don't know that's just me. \nEveryone is different i guess, just saying. :b\ufeff",

A lot of them also \nhave small clearings with free exercising machines, so you can use those \ntoo! And if you only have time during night time, parks also have those \nmachines, and a LOT of people go to parks to exercise at night, so it's not \ndangerous (they might even have aerobics events, but I'm not sure if those \nare free, never tried them) and you feel encouraged because \"hey all these \npeople are exercising too! I should walk another round tonight!.\"\n\nAlso don't worry a lot when people comment you're fat, unlike let's say, \nthe US, people genuinely mention your weight because they're worried about \nyour health and want you to look good (like how moms/grandmas do), so if \nyou tell them that you're dieting and exercising, they'll praise you.

I think, maybe they learned a different language in school, \nor maybe English is their second language, or maybe their parents speak a \ndifferent language and they're translating for them. that's VERY common \nhere.

Texas (especially Houston, Austin, \nand San Antonio) is actually very culturally diverse and accepting. For \nevery racist, ignorant, asshole, there's 200X more non-racist people. In \nfact, Texas is known for being very polite, and we stick up for each other. \nIf we see a person being rude to someone else because of their race or any \nother reason, there's a good chance that person will get a stern talking-to \neven from a complete stranger.
