You just tell the waiter if they ask if anyone is joining you \nthat you just are grabbing a bite to eat by yourself. I'm twenty years old \nand haven't really done the relationship thing - trust me, if you go long \nenough, you learn to just live with it instead of complaining about it. The \npain kind of numbs eventually. I know that sounds depressing, but it's just \nlife. And trust me, I made it through high school without going to Prom \nwith someone (I went to junior prom with some friends, but I skipped senior \nprom). It's not that big of a deal and you realize quickly that dating in \nhigh school is just a way of figuring out what you like, a sort of trial \nfor real life.
