Heck, most of the black people \nI've known in real-life have had thinner lips than I do, and I'm Norwegian. \nBig lips aren't a universally black thing, it's more common among west \nAfricans, and most African Americans are descended from west Africans. \nWhite people can have thick lips, black people can have thin lips, and \npeople in general can have everything in between. It's not racist for a \nwhite person to try and have bigger lips, anymore that it's racist for a \nblack person to bleach their hair. Granted, I'm not American and don't know \nquite how things work over there and I know there is a lot of unpleasant \nhistory, but it does strike me as somewhat odd and a bit ignorant to put \npeople in these strict categories and deny that there are a lot of \nvariations and overlaps in each ethnicity.\ufeff",
