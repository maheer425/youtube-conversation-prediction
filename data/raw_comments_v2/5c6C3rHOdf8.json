He had great impact, he literally changed \nthe world and he had a memorable participation in history and was a wise \nman, and I learned from him to be a seeker of truth, his mission was more \nvaluable to him that his own life.

            "text": "+David Munoz Jesus had the weight of the world on his shoulders. Even \nbefore the crucifixion began, he clearly had physical symptoms associated \nwith severe stress. The night before the execution, his disciples reported \nseeing Jesus in agony on the Mount of Olives. Not only did he not sleep all \nnight, but he seems to have been sweating profusely. So great was the \nstress that tiny blood vessels were rupturing in his sweat glands and \nemitting as great red drops that fell to the ground (see Luke 22:44). This \nsymptom of severe stress is called hematohidrosis. Jesus was physically \nexhausted and in danger of going into shock unless he received fluids \n(which he apparently did not). \n\nHaving previously been beaten by the Jews, it was now the Romans\u2019 turn. The \nbeatings administered by Roman soldiers are well known to be very bloody, \nleaving lacerations all over the body. Romans designed their whips to cut \nthe flesh from their victim\u2019s bodies. These beatings were designed to be \npainful to the extreme. It would also cause a fluid build up around his \nlungs. In addition, a crown of thorns was forced into his scalp which was \ncapable of severely irritating major nerves in his head, causing increasing \nand excruciating pain, as the hours wore on.\n\nIn Christ\u2019s severely stressed condition, these beatings were easily enough \nto kill him. His body was horribly bruised, cut and bleeding. Having had no \nnourishment for many hours, and having lost fluids through profuse sweating \nand much bleeding, Jesus would have been severely dehydrated. This brutal \ntorture would certainly be sending him into what doctors today call a \n\"shock\", and shock kills.\n\nIn addition, Jesus was forced to carry the the wooden beam on which he \nwould die. Imagine the effect of carrying a heavy weight if you were in \nthat condition.\n\nHis median nerve of his hands were pierced by iron nails, his foot's \nplantar nerve ruptured with an iron nail. His body on the cross was \npositioned in a way which makes it difficult for him to breathe. There is \nno question that it was painful beyond words and Jesus chose and willed his \nmoment of death. \"No one can take my life from me. I sacrifice it \nvoluntarily. For I have the authority to lay it down when I want to and \nalso to take it up again. For this is what my Father has commanded.\"\n\nNear the end, a criminal beside him mocked, \"If you are the Christ, save \nyourself and us!\" Little did this sinner know that the man he was speaking \nto hung there voluntarily. He was speaking to our father, capable of \nreleasing all the power in the universe and beyond, and easily saving \nhimself. Jesus remained in this agony and shame, not because he was \npowerless, but because of his incredible love for humanity. He suffered to \nprovide the needed way of salvation for you and me.\n\nLastly, you have no idea the punishment the roman soldiers would have to \nendure if the crucifixion did not go as planned. \"Crucifixion is a form of \nslow and painful *execution*\", the roman soldiers made sure Jesus died on \nthat cross by piercing him with a spear, otherwise they themselves would be \nfacing great punishments from their empire. John 19:32 \"One of the \nsoldiers, however, pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood \nflowed out\".\n\nLook up these two terms:\n- Flagrum\n- Holy Lance\n\nThanks for your text, really had a fun time replying to it (boredom :p).

Large numbers of religious were persecuted and killed \nfor practicing religion, and for being interference to atheist-communist \nexpansion.\n\nFew quotes for you to read:\n\n\"You know, they are fooling us, there is no God...all this talk about God \nis sheer nonsense\" \n\n\"The first requisite for the happiness of the people is the abolition of \nreligion\"\n\n\"Atheism is the natural and inseparable part of Communism.\"\n\n\"Our program necessarily includes the propaganda of atheism.\"\n\n\"We do not fight against believers and not even clergymen.

It's true that religion has been implicated in all sorts of \nconflict and violence throughout human history. I'm not saying there isn't \nblood on the hands of the faithful, religion can be a force of great harm. \nBut the picture is much more complex than is often implied. For example, \ndinner party guests are likely to nod in agreement when someone mentions \nthe \"millions killed\" at the hands of the church but historians now suggest \naround 5,000 - 6,000 over a 350 year period. That's less than 18 a year! of \ncourse one a year is terrible enough, but the point that i'm trying to make \nis that reality appears a long way from what you are often served up. \nLikewise the idea that most of the wars of history have been caused by \nreligion is demonstrably false.

Once they do, they will diffuse into an equilibrium with energy \nequally distributed. Whether or not the idea sounds like shit doesn't mean \nit is. Whether or not an idea is true determines if it is shit. The sun \ndoes not have infinite energy to stay together, so it will eventually burn \nout and the sun dies, allowing its heat to spread evenly. Say the heat \ndoesn't kill the hydra, well now the hydra has no energy source. Without \nany energy, it won't be able to do anything and it will die. Once plants \nand herbivores die, they'll be eaten by omnivores and carnivores. Then the \ndecomposers will eat their remains. Eventually all food supply will empty \nout meaning no nutrition or energy for any life on earth, causing them to \ndie. The core of the earth will cool down and the earth will no longer be \nprotected by its magnetic field. It is now going to be affected by high \namounts of radiation, causing it to become like mars. The water will \nvaporize and the atmosphere will disappear, dissipating evenly. Eventually, \nall stars will die out and our universe will continue expanding. Any damage \nto the earth will be irreversible unless there is energy to allow it to \nbecome back to its ordered state. As the earth breaks apart into small \nrocky particles, the atoms in those particles, given enough time, will \ndecay down into fundamental particles that will eventually be floating in \nthe universe and not interacting with anything. With no energy differences \nor interaction, life is not possible and the universe will \"die\" in a heat \ndeath.\n\nSweet dreams. ",
