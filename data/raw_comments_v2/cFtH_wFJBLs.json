Also his skins look \nreally cool.\nTwitch looks much more like what i imagined a giant rat would be, and is \nreally cool too. He would rather stay back and poison his enemies to death, \nwhich also deal ridiculous burst damage.\nI have trouble deciding because im worried that people will be all, \n\"rengars op omg ur such a noob\". But at the same time rengar looks way more \nbadass than twitch to me. Both im fine playing with, but i cant decide who \ni should get.\ufeff",
