Now imagine a twelve-year-old sitting through the entire thing, I \nthink I have a longer attention span then some of the adults here. I will \nwatch any musical, and I have watched a lot. I don't think that the movie \nwas that great, but it is a good way to be introduced to the play. Also, \nwhat about the people who like to listen to the soundtrack? I find that it \nis a good thing on long car trips to listen to, and if it's all in song, \nthen you don't have to improvise between the songs. Overall, I love this \nmusical, and I think that some people need to think more about other \npeople's feelings.\ufeff",
