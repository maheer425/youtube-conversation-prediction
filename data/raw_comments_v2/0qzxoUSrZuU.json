So they needed someone to guard it, and once \nIndy passed the test he tried to give the Protector role to Indy (as he had \njust shown that he was too old to really protect the Grail) fully believing \nthat the Crusades were still going on (especially since his brothers didn't \ncome to tell him otherwise, probably died before the Crusades ended).",

Think about it: Kazim tries to stop the Nazis from getting the \nGrail, so it's obvious that he wasn't allied with them, and that and the \nfact that it is one of the most crucial plot points in the whole movie. If \nKazim hadn't told Indy where his dad was, than he never would have found \nhis dad and they wouldn't have gone after the grail, and there would be no \nmovie. So Kazim desperately doesn't want the Nazis to find the Grail, yet \nhe's supposed to somehow know where Indy's dad was? It's one of the biggest \nunexplained plot holes in the entire franchise,and yet I have literally \nnever heard anyone bring it up. In the first draft of the Last Crusade, \nKazim (named Kemal in this draft of the story) was the main villain. He is \na Hatayn secret agent who allies with the Nazis because he wants to Grail \nfor the Glory of his people. He and Colonel Vogel try to kill Indy and Elsa \nin the Venice scene. Walter Donovan (Walter Chandler in this draft) falls \nto his death with the tank, and Kemal shoots Indy's dad in the temple, and \nthen dies from drinking the wrong chalice. Later, Colonel Vogel crushed is \ncrushed by a boulder while stealing the grail, and Elsa falls into \neverlasting darkness. In this draft, it would have made so much more sense \nhow Kazim (or Kemal) knew where Indy's dad was because he was originally \nallied with the Nazis, but screenwriter Jeffrey Boam, in the final draft of \nthe film, changed Kemal to Kazim and Chanlder to Donovan, and made Donovan \nthe main villain. So it was never explained how someone who had NO ties to \nGermany knew where Indy's father was. Also, no one has EVER brought this \nobvious plot-hole up. As a side note, I kinda wish Kazim was the main bad \nguy, as Kevork Malikyan would have made a pretty badass villain, but I'm \ngetting of topic. So how did Kazim know where Indy's dad was?
