My \nparents later split up but whilst we lived in the house I always got this \ncreepy feeling that I wasn't alone. I used to get really paranoid so \nwhenever I went in my room I used to turn music on my radio on to 'scare \nthe monster's away'. Every time I did this i used to feel safe and I way \nable to shake off the feeling of not being alone. I am just going to add \nthat I have only experienced two paranormal occurings in my life however I \ndo not believe in ghosts. When I was about 4 or 5 my parents asked me to go \nand get something from my room. Now I'm not really sure what exactly it was \nthey wanted me to get but it's not really relevant to the story. As usual, \nI ran up the stairs and switched on the music. It was winter so obviously \nquite dark. Therefore I also switched the lights on. Eventhough the music \nwas on I had the feeling again. This was when it got creepy. All of a \nsudden the lights went out. At this point I was freaking out and just when \nI was about to sprint for the door, the radio switched to a strange station \nwith a creepy, old man singing a nursery rhyme I can't remember. By now I \nwas halfway down the stairs. I can't even begin to describe the man's voice \nit was like an extra terrestrial being of some sort. \n\nSo on to the second story.\n\nOne of my other strange habits when's I was younger was in used to bolt up \nand down the stairs to the bathroom became it was so dark downstairs. One \nday I was walking down the stairs as usual when I heard crashes of pans and \ncutlery. I didn't realty want to investigate as I was rubbish at sneaking \naround. Frozen with fear, I just stood there listening. I closed my eyes \nbecause I was just overcome with fear. As I quickly flew up the stairs, \nstill with my eyes closed, I heard someones or something whisper into my \near \"running won't help you now\". As fast as lightening I raced up the \nstairs to my room. The scariest thing was, the voice was the same as the \nman from the radio.\ufeff",

            "text": "This will probably get lost in the comments but here is a story about a \nstory lol. \n\nAt work it was a few days before halloween, and I was just working at my \njob. At my job we had little halloween stickers that we gave out to \nchildren, I had offered some to a little girl and she looked at her mother \nin hesitation and i wondered what could be the problem. The mother said \" o \nwe don't don't celebrate halloween,\" now we were in a pretty religious side \nof town so it was understandable, but then her mother says, \"ya... mommy \nknows all too well how real that world really is\" I just stood there, not \nknowing how to respond. She says \"are you a christian?\" i said yes i am, \nshe says \"o you're familiar with names in the bible and the stories in it?\" \nI said a good amount yes. She said \"well i used to practice witchcraft, and \none night i had a dream of people disappearing from earth, everything was \non fire and i was just walking down the street holding someones hand and he \nwas talking to me about the destruction, he was telling me what was going \non and then i asked him what his name was, He stopped, looked at me, and \nsaid Beezlebub, then we just kept walking. I woke up not knowing what any \nof it meant until someone over heard me talking about it and said that \nsounds awfully like the rapture in the bible. i said, whats that? I have \nnever heard of it, and who is this guy with the silly name Beezlebub. The \nlady said.... Beezlebub? honey i think you should look into your dream. So \ni did read the bible, and realized what i actually had dreamt about. and \nthats why we don't celebrate halloween.\" \n\nBasically for those who are religious or not, she had dreamt of the second \ncoming of Jesus and that she had been left behind in the fire and \ndestruction with all the others. And the person or thing she was walking \nwith, Beezlebub, is simply put, the ruler of demons.\ufeff",

We didnt \nnoticed it at first but then shit got real.Younger bro of my friend started \nstaring at the window. And I saw that in his eyes, he was so scared he \ncouldnt even scream. We all got to that window only to se a strange tall \nman in a hood. We all started srceaming. We locked every door and window \nand called the police. That was the worst 30 minutes in my life. He was \ngoning around the house, walking kinda oddly. One girl saw a hand print on \nthe window, and we were hearing chilling sounds from the outside. When the \npolice arrived, the guy dissapeard. Dog had a huge wound on his belly, he \nbarely survived. To this day police didnt find the guy \nSorry for bad english\ufeff",

            "text": "I had a similar one to the \"rah\" child... I was talking to my mom about her \nhaving a new boyfriend- no one else was in the house a bloodchilling voice \nscreeched very loudly \"no.\" I literally almost pissed myself when a similar \nstory popped up, because I realized I had almost forgotten it (I was young, \nI believe my mind blocked it out) and to this day I swear, whatever it is, \nit is still around. I feel cold spots appear in my room constantly- and \nit's been in multiple houses so I know it's not a draft. It always happens \naround 11pm and 1:15am at almost those exact times and to this day no \nmatter how much I crank up the heat in my room it still appears. I've cried \nmyself to sleep, hiding under my covers praying it would go away and have \neven sometimes slept under my bed and fortified the edges with blankets and \npillows when I was younger. Another time it was rather... active. I was at \nmy friends house and it was, you guessed it, 1:14 and less than 30 seconds \nfrom 1:15 when car doors started slamming outside. We ran out to look (I \nwas twelve at the time) and all the doors were open, as well as the tools \nin his dads tailgate crate being scattered everywhere in the lot. When we \nwalked back in through the screen door, we heard a blood curtling scream, \nlike an animal in pain, and we went outside again to find that the doors \nwere opened. We ran to his room, he slept on the bed.. Where I was? \nUnderneath it. He told that story to friends at school and the taunting \nfrom peers went all the way until I graduated highschool. I'm 19 now, and \ncan't even sleep with the lights on. Because one night I saw the \napparition- it was a small woman dressed in tattered clothes and had debris \nin her hair and gave off the smell of rotten food or something... Her \n\"skin\" was chunked away in places as if she had been floating down a river \nor been in the bottom of a lake- I really had no time for details. I ran. \nAnd ran. All the way from Eagle Creek Oregon to Estacada, until my asthma \nforced me to stop. Then I realized she had appeared near the creek that \nruns behind my house, eagle phern, and was terrified. There are no \nhistory's of drowning near my house... I almost felt a form of sympathy \nrising from me- as if she needed help.\n\nThis happened around the time my cousin drowned due to an undertow from a \njetboat on the clackamas river... I can only pray that it's not her soul \nthat may be haunting me. Sorry this was so lengthy, I swear I'm not lying, \nI've gone to counseling at red soils campus oregon city for this... Why \nwould she still be here? I can't figure it out, I hardly knew her when she \ndied (I was 7 and have memory loss from my younger childhood... And \nsometimes I get glimpses at it when I see things that are similar to it) I \nhave never returned there, even though my parents still live there. And \nyes, they still experience unexplained events like I did, but refuse to \nmove. Does anyone know why this could be? Any locals seeing this who might \nhave a clue?\n\nAnd to note, I remembered everything except the scream of \"no\" up until now \nand it took me almost 10 minutes of having the video paused for me to \nremember why it was so eerily familiar... It made my hair stand on end, \neven on my scalp. And as I'm editing this it is 12:12 and I can feel the \nchill on my back.\ufeff",
