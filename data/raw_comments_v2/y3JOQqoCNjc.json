In family court, men only receive sole custody \nof their kids 10% of the time while division of assets is skewed to benefit \nthe ex wife. In our prision system, for the same crime, women on average \nreceive a 17 month sentance while men receive a 40 month sentance average. \nThere are over 200 federally funded programs that solely help women while \nthere aren't any federally funded programs that solely help men. Female \ngenital multilation is illegal while male genitial multilation is legal. \nThis is to name a few. But moving on from the law. \n\nThe truth about the wage gap: for every dollar a man earns, a woman earns \n77 cents. The lie about the wage gap: for every dollar a man earns, a woman \nearns 77 cents for the same job. This figure from the census bureau does \nnot factor that men on average retire later (the time of your life you've \nclimbed the career ladder and make the most money), it doesn't factor that \nfull time male workers on average work 7 hours longer per week than full \ntime female workers, it doesn't factor that men take riskier jobs that pay \nmore, it doesn't factor that women are usually the ones that take almost a \ndecade off climbing the career ladders to raise their children. \n\nI am not saying that women don't have problems. But I am saying that (1) \nmen are not the cause of their problems and (2) their problems are \ntypically heard and cared about while problems that are solely men's \nproblems are cared about a lot less if at all. By many of the standards \nthat people cite to claim that blacks are oppressed compared to whites, men \nfare much worse on those standards compared to women. ",
