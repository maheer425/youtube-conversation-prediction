Over \nthe next two years I rebuilt the top end, the carb, did lots of body work \nand redid the interior, most of it in shops class at my local high school \nfor credit.  \nAt sixteen, when I wanted to licence it, all I did was go down to the local \ngovernment insurance place (yes, in \"communist\" Canada our car insurance is \nrun by the government.) They did a run on the serial number, asked me where \nI got the car, they knew the lady personally, and five minutes later the \ncar was insured! \nAt 21 I sold it to a friend for $400 who wanted it for his wedding, and he \ntotally restored it. \n\nThe car handled like a pig, it spun the tires with ease (maybe to much \nease, but as a 15 year old, oh what fun), but best first car ever!

Also, to borrow something from what you typed in your last \ncomment: Please, do yourself a favor and don't make bullshit assumptions \nabout the habits of Americans when it comes to ANYTHING American. \n\nI based my comment off of the fact that I've seen Europeans do nothing but \nhate on American cars saying how much better their brand-new BMW, \nRolls Royce, Mercedes, Vauxhall, etc. is compared to something built 50 \nyears ago in the United States.\n\nNow, there is one thing you're right about... I do not have a passport. But \nthis is not because I lack the ambition to travel, but because I lack the \nFUNDS to travel. Because while it is fairly inexpensive to travel in \nEurope, that is not so in the United States.  So don't go making \nassumptions.\n\nBut once again you're wrong because I do not watch the news. It's nothing \nbut trash today. I do not believe that the Earth is 6,000 years old... in \nfact I believe mainstream science's agreement that the earth is closer to \n4,000,000,000 years old.

Now, I'm going to guess by your \natrocious spelling that you're some kind of Limey prick whose only goal in \nlife is to kiss the entire royal family's ass. So don't forget, if AMERICAN \nships with AMERICAN supplies didn't risk the Wolf Packs of the last \nEuropean war your entire island would have been choked off by the Nazis and \nyou'd be living under fascist rule.\n\nSo do us a favor (and this is for all Europeans), stop making up bullshit \non YouTube about what we Americans do and do not think and or do.\n\nAuf Wiedersehen - you Limey douchebag.
