She has a shield? Braum can block \nentire skillshots, regardless of damage. She has a slow? Braum has a stun \nON HIS AUTO-ATTACK. She has a speed-boost? Braum has a jump that can be \nused for instant engages and retreats. The only thing she has that Braum \ndoesn't is her heal and a few small buffs, most of them tied to her ult, \nbut if you chose a champ solely for its ult, you chose poorly.\n\nI wanted to like Lulu when I got her, I mean that sincerely, but in S4 it's \nflabbergasting how completely void of presence she is against better \ninitiating support champs. Her damage would be mediocre even if you DIDN'T \nhave to build support items, and her kit gives nothing to a champion that \nwouldn't be easily over-favored by the insane sustain of Nami's healspam or \nthe ridiculous stunlocking powers of Braum or Leona.",
