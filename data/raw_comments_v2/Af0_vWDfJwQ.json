If the sponge is stationary, \nthe travel through the invisible spongy material is at one speed and it is \nthe same as what an outside observer would see.  If you rotate the sponge \naround the central axis of the galaxy so it would be moving with the stars, \nthen the relative velocity of the stars would be less through the Higgs \nfield.

We can't see dark matter itself, but we can \nmathematically and scientifically demonstrate the existence of 'something \nelse' and deduce what it is using measurement. Let me give you a basic \nexample of how that works. Algebra.\n\nIf you have 4 + x = 7, what is x? It's 3. This is how we measure \ndarkmatter, we're measuring the unknown by the quantifiable result of the \nwhole, and some of its factors. \n\nWhen we look at the galaxy, we see a lot more mass in our measurements than \nwe see stars the other stuff that would be there. The x, in this case, is \nthe extra mass. Let's give what we can see a number, shall we? The stuff we \ncan directly observe, we'll give it the number 2. But we have a galaxy that \nweighs 10, and another 2 won't work, 2+2 =/= 10. So even if we double all \nthe observable mass in the galaxy, it still doesn't account for all that \nextra mass in the galaxy. There is something there, something we can't see.\n\nWe don't rightly know what it is, but based on its effects, particularly \nthe gravitational effect it has on the galaxy as a whole, it has to be very \nmassive. Because we can't see it, it has to be very dark. So we call it \n'dark matter'. It's a bit of a misnomer because we don't really know what \nit is. Scientists aren't pretending that they know exactly what it is, and \nthey could have just called it 'x' if they wanted to, all we know is that 2 \n+ dark matter = 10, so we CAN quantify it.\n\nOne last example. Get up really early one morning and sit in a dark room \nbefore sunrise. As the room fills up with light before you've even seen the \nsun that day, ask yourself, where is the light coming from?\n\nThe difference with religious postulations of 'god did it' is that god \ncan't be quantified. If he could, then we'd be able to demonstrate his \nexistence, that's why people ask for evidence of God. But then the \nreligious turn around and ADMIT he can't be quantified because he's \nsupernatural.... but somehow he has an affect on the natural world. If \nsomething is having an effect on the natural world, then we'd be able to \nsee the effect, even if we couldn't see the source. We'd be able to measure \nit, observe its effects, and quantify its existence, even if we couldn't \nplace exactly what 'it' was.\n\nEven if one were to postulate that dark matter = God, it would still be a \nguess, and not even an educated one. When scientists talk about what they \nknow, they are not afraid to admit, \"we don't know, that's why we're \ninvestigating, so we can find out.\" When the religious talk about what they \nknow, they say, \"the bible says it, it must be true, no need to \ninvestigate.\"",

But \nif you look at areas in the sky where you would predict these large black \nholes to be at, you don't find the micro-lenses that they would create if \nthey were there (since gravity also affects the path light takes, \nremember?).\nThere is also a more troubling issue: to have a universe with a matter \ndistribution like ours, some form of matter is required that does not at \nall interact with light. You see, in the very early universe the energies \nwere high enough for matter to constantly annihilate and produce matter \nagain (in the latest phases through annihilation into gamma radiation and \npair-production from light). This causes a \"mixing\" of the matter though \nthe universe and irons out inhomogeneities. Once the universe cooled down \nenough, this process stopped and the \"normal\" matter could finally \naccumulate to form galaxies etc. But calculations show that the universe \nwas much too homogenous to have this sponge-like structure we observe arise \non its own by just this process.\nThis discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, that does \nnot interact with light at all, so it can accumulate and form \ninhomogeneities earlier that the visible matter content. These \ninhomogeneities can then act as gravity wells for the visible matter to \naccumulate in. As far as we can tell so far, this is the best explanation \nfor the large scale structure of the universe that we know of.\nThere is also another problem with black holes as dark matter: there is no \nknown process by which this enormous number of black holes could possibly \nbe produced. Simple accumulation by gravity would require much longer times \nthan the observed age of the universe and also a much more inhomogeneous \nthat we find our universe to be.\nBut that was still a nice idea ;)",

It's such a sad, sad thing that these people consider \nthemselves intelligent. Electromagnetism is the one force of the universe \nwe truly understand, and to say it's responsible for dark matter is about \nthe single dumbest explanation I have ever heard in my life. We don't know \n*anything* about dark matter, except that it is NOT part of the \nelectro-weak-strong forces, as those are all part of the *physical existing \nuniverse*. That is literally *the only thing we know about dark matter for \nsure* That's about as dumb as saying that *gravity* is caused by \nelectromagnetism. It's simply a total separate, completely irrelevant force \nthat has nothing to do with the carrying particles of electromagnetism and \nhas no relation to electromagnetism whatsoever. Gravity and dark matter \nboth exists regardless of the existence of electromagnetic fields, and the \nexistence of things like black holes prove this, they have so much gravity \nthat they obliterate the carrying particles of electromagnetism, if dark \nmatter or gravity were related to electromagnetism, black holes could not \nexist, and we know that their existence is vital to the creation of \nimportant structures like galaxies that heard stars together so they don't \nflail about randomly smashing into each other.\n\nIt's just stupid and wrong. Gravity, Dark Matter, and Dark Energy are all \npart of the *dark universe* or whatever you want to call it, that can not \nbe observed or interacted with by the physical universe. These parts of the \nuniverse are totally separate from mass, energy, particles, and the \nelectro-strong-weak forces, which *DO* exist, and can be measured, viewed, \nunderstood, and studied. We can watch the carrying particles of \nelectromagnetism do their thing, and they do what electromagnetism should \ndo. If they caused gravity, or dark matter we would have seen it a *LOOOONG \ntime ago*... Like seriously, do you think every scientist in the world is a \ncomplete and total moron who never thought to check if electromagnetism, a \nforce they can observe and study in detail was causing other forces of \nnature? In fact, it would be *glaringly obvious* the second we gained the \nability to study electromagnetism if it was causing dark matter, or dark \nenergy, or gravity.\n\nNow if you want to tell me dark matter is caused by gravity in some way, \nthen sure, that's debatable, if totally unprovable with no evidence to back \nit up, at least it's within the realm of possibility. But it's more likely \nit's caused by giant elk men in pink tuxedos swinging around jars of \nmarmalade at the center of the universe then it is being caused by the \nelectro-strong-weak forces. \n\nBut then again, what level of intelligence should I expect from youtubers?\ufeff",
