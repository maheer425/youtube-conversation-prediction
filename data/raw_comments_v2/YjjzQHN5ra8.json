That didn't work so well either. \nIt was hell to pull it because the bracket they give with the kit would \nbend and the cable was hard to pull. Then when you did get it locked into \n4x4, soon as you hit a rough spot and had to actually use the 4x4 the cable \nwould give and it would kick it back down to 2 wheel drive and get me \nstuck. 3 motors (350 V8's), 7 transmissions (th350's), 4 4x4 actuators + a \nmanual one, 2 ECU's, a rear end, 3 front drive shafts, the fuel gauge, the \nwindshield wipers, and a drive shaft later I finally decided to sale my \nchevy. I bought a ford and drove it for 10 years and never once broke down \nand my ex wife put sugar in the gas tank. I own a Jeep cherokee now and \nit's never gave me a problem either. \ufeff",
