I was watching South Park in 1999 when it came \nout, in friggin Romania from all places, and although we didn't understand \na lot of american pop culture reference back then, we all fall in love of \nthe show. All students from all over were talking about it. So better watch \nout, scientology, you don't want to pick on someone that can poop all over \nyour porch, especially if you are very concerned about getting your porch \ndirty...\ufeff",
