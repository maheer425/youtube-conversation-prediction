In bread it is used as a stabilizer that results in firm bread \nthat does not crack. This dim bulb also once stated, \"There is just no \nacceptable level of any chemical to ingest, ever.\" For those of us that are \nactually aware that everything is chemicals; this should give you a \nheadache. \n\nAs for the donuts, the chemical that makes them brighter is Titanium \nDioxide and it is an inactive ingredient. It does not harm you to ingest \nthe chemical in food. It is a class 2B carcinogen like azodicarbonamide \nor caramel color level IV. Class 2B means that \"the agent (mixture) is \npossibly carcinogenic to humans.\" There is not enough evidence to claim it \nis carcinogenic, but there is a possibility that it may be carcinogenic.\ufeff",

Over half of all wheat produced in the US goes to feed \nlivestock. Roughly, 90% of soy, oats, and other grains are also fed to \nlivestock. If you freed up all that grain every person on the planet could \nget 1 cup of grain a day. Hunger is not due to lack of food resources but \nthe distribution of food resources. Privileged people would rathr feed food \nto cows rather than to starving humans just so they can eat their steak. \n5. Labor rights.

Some \nare derived from biproducts of other food production, and some are \nsynthesized in a lab - which doesn't necessarily mean it's unhealthy or \nunnatural, although scepticism is in order.\nMy guess is they've replaced half the powdered sugar with flour, then added \nartificial sweeteners and preservatives to make up for the lost flavour and \npreservative effect of the sugar, and then added something - maybe a mix of \nthings - that makes the sugar seem less dry and more savoury. The result is \nthat they can cut some 50 calories off the donut and make it taste more \nsavoury, making it more addictive (and, I suppose, more tasty). Both will \ntend to make business sense if large scale production can be undertaken.\nNone of this is supposed to be an endorsement.
