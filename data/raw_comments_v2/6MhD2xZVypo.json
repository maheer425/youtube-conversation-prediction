My literature teacher in \nmiddle school was a really passionate man, he read us poetry and he could \nalmost be seen crying in front of the class when reading \"A Silvia\", a \ntragic, heart-rending poem. And I myself cried when he was reading it. When \nmy high school teacher had to explain the same poem in high school, she \nsaid \"Well, all of you surely know this famous poem, so we'll skip reading \nit and start with the analisys: first thing we notice is that the first and \nlast words of the first stanza are anagrams\"...
