The Chinese government has already implemented \nnumerous measures and policies to ensure that coal consumption will be \nbanned in major cities by 2017. By 2030, China won't be using coal for \nenergy anymore. For starters, hundreds of poorly managed factories that \ncontributed to pollution were already closed down. Plus, China made deals \nwith Russia for natural gas and is atm having deals made with Australia as \nwell. And on the issue of China denying pollution, animal smuggling, animal \npoaching and human rights problem, China does indeed censor those \ninformation. So what? It's not like the Chinese public doesn't know. You \nneed to actually travel there and ask around. The Chinese people know about \nthe pollution, the censorship, animal smuggling and poaching. It's hardly \nnews. Plus, pollution is a product of capitalism. It's not like China \ninvented it. The west created the industrial age and simply relocated it to \nAsia. India has pollution, Vietnam has it too, Philippines as well. For the \nanimal poaching, Europeans and Americans travel to Africa and kill animals \nall the time. Right ... you guys don't call that poaching, you call it \nsportive hunting, aka entertainment. Like that's any better. Human rights? \nUnder the patriot act, that's something equivalent as farce. Censorship? \nSomeone forgot about Edward Snowden? When democratic states brand \njournalists who expose unprecedented scales of human rights violations \nexercised by the government for the good of mankind, what did those who \nhave always promoted freedom of speech actually do? They branded Edward \nSnowden and Glenn Greenwald as criminals and force them to become \nfugitives. Hell, Britain even arrested Glenn Greenwald's partner and \ndemanded the Guardian newspaper to dispose of materials related to that \ncase. For a democratic society, that's ironic. Human rights and freedom of \nspeech don't exist. Stop being naive. We all live with the limited amount \nof freedom our governments allow us to have. Some governments have the most \nadvanced technologies to spy on its citizens without them knowing, so \npeople innocently believe they have freedom. That's not a privilege.
