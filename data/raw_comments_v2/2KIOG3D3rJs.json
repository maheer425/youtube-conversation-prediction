If not for the Zoos \nthen many species would already be extinct.\n Whales were hunted to near extinction because people wanted them \nslaughtered for oil to burn so they could have light in their homes... Same \nthing(in principal) still happening 300 years later.\n Wild habitats are destroyed so that consumers can have more \nworthless stuff and nothing else, so before you start crying about \ncorporations and governments look at yourself and see if you are a part of \nthe chain.\n We the people are what enables them to make profit from claiming  jungle \nfor farmland, to build mines, oil fields, roads, create pollution, build \nfactories, over harvest natural resources, and on and on.\n Nature is a delicate complex web, and the more we partake in technology \nthe more destruction we cause. The good news is that humans aren't powerful \nenough to destroy the Earth, only powerful enough to make it inhospitable \nto us, nature will reach its breaking point, correct the problem, shake us \nsilly humans off and go on without us.\n We do not own the Earth, it owns us, if you live against nature you will \nlose.\n  \ufeff",

Well, it is a YT post not a round table \ndiscussion...there's only so much space available for a single post.\n But, the bottom line is that turning jungle into farmland causes \ndesertification, pumping billions and billions of gallons of oil out of \nthe earth and burning it in the atmosphere causes too many disturbances to \nnature to list here, I can go on and on all day with this stuff.\n The results of consumerism are changing the planet before your very eyes \nyet you and some other people here claim that we don't impact nature, we \ncan just do whatever we like and there are no reactions to our actions its \nalways some other explanation, like your account of the problem \nwith pandas. You think their gene pool got low just because they lost \ninterest in sex, and it had nothing to do with deforestation and the \nremoval their ecological niche, eh? You may have stated the reason why \npandas are close to extinction you just forgot to include the part about \nhow it got to be that way.
