He never had me down. He never cut me. I was forcing the fight. \nHe kept trying to tie me up on the inside\" all that is true, but that is \nalso true of the majority of Mayweathers fights over the past 10 years.\n\nThey all could say that.\n\nIt's not what Mayweather does to you, it's what Mayweather does not allow \nyou to do to him, that wins him fights. He does not allow his opponents to \nhurt him much, nail him clean, gain momentum, he snuffs his opponent out. \nThus because he does that. Mayweather does not have to do much in terms of \nbeing offensive to win fights. He does not have to beat the fighter down. \nHe does not have to win rounds heavy. He does not have to get involved in \nfurious exchanges. Sure you can get fighters who can be elusive but \nMayweather's genius is that he can do that and still do enough to win his \nfights.\n\nAND THAT'S A SERIOUS SKILL IN ITSELF\n\nMayweather wasn't running from Pac-Man. Stats show he threw more punches \nand never once did Kenny Bayliss (The Ref) caution Mayweather for not \nfighting. Having said. I do think father time is catching up on Floyd. In \nhis younger days he was a lot more aggressive and on the front foot and \nthrew combos back in the day, when you watch Mayweather against Gatti and \nCorrales you see he;s a totally different fighter now, than he was then, \nbut then again weren't all boxer more aggressive and gung ho in their \nyounger days ?\n\nFact is Mayweather is an undefeated multi millionaire who wont be suffering \nfrom a slurred speech later in life or Parkinsons. He's a smart guy, inside \nand outside the ring. He answers to no-one. He has no promoter as he has \nMayweather Promotions because he bought out Arum early in his career, \nbecause Arum was up De La Hoya's a.s.s at that time.\n\nIs Mayweather exciting ? No.\n\nIs he TBE ? Defensively - Yes. Offensively - No.\ufeff",
