            "text": "\u3055\u3093 - san is actually closer to a catch all honorific in American context. \nIt IS what you use in polite conversation when speaking formally to people, \nbut considering we Americans don't tend to call our classmates, coworkers, \nand people on the street default by their last name, it doesn't make much \nsense to us. If you have 2 third graders who are not that close called Mike \nApplebee and Drew Smith, they will call each other Mr. Applebee and Mr. \nSmith in the Japanese system. \"First\" (really second) names in Japan are to \nJapanese people what nicknames are to us. We are completely ok calling John \nDoe John to his face even though we aren't that close, unless it's strictly \nbusinessman-client or doctor patient or something VERY formal. You can use \nsan to speak with superiors (meiue). The caveat is that because they are \nmeiue, they don't HAVE to speak formally or respectfully to you, but they \nchoose to because they are not fartbags.\n\n\u304f\u3093 - kun on the other hand is...actually very rarely used when compared to \n-san. In fact, it's less of a honorific to denote closeness and more of an \nhonorific to make the name diminutive, like little boys. It'd be the \nequivalent of saying \"Little Johnny\". Just Johnny would actually be better \ntranslated simply as the name. See, if you are at the point where kun would \nnot be offensive, you are close enough to the person that just using their \nname should be ok (and usually preferred).\n\nThe female equivalent \u3061\u3083\u3093 chan is TECHNICALLY identical in function to kun \nIN THEORY. In practice, it's a whole different thing altogether in usage.\n\nThe honorifics that would be used specifically to denote superiority and \nrespect are either niche e.g. senpai or anachronistic e.g. dono or just \nplain odd e.g. sama. Yes, fangirls raving about Sesshoumaru-sama~~ sounds \njust as weird in Japanese as it does in English. So san is pretty much the \nbread and butter for names. If you have no idea which honorific to use, san \nis your best bet in every situation no matter who you're talking to.\n\n24% of expression of formality and respect is expressed through wordchoice \n(like in English). 1% is the above. The other 50% is the conjugation of \nverbs. You are reading that correctly. You conjugate all verbs based on \nformality. I am not kidding.\ufeff",
