Zed now offers power to those who embrace \nknowledge of the shadows, and slays those who cling to ignorance.\nAn orphan, Zed was taken in and trained by a great ninja master. Only one \nother student appeared to be Zed's equal - the master's son, Shen. It \nseemed Zed could never win the favor of the master, as every match between \nthe rivals ended in a draw. Frustrated and jealous, he sought an advantage. \nThe young ninja ventured into a sealed part of the clan's temple, where he \nfound an ornate, foreboding box. Sensing the dark knowledge within, Zed \nknew he should not open it, but he peered inside nonetheless. In an \ninstant, shadows touched his mind, revealing techniques that had long been \nhidden. Now armed with a secret edge, he challenged Shen, and this time he \ndefeated the master's son. He expected praise and recognition in his moment \nof victory, but somehow the master knew Zed had used forbidden ways, and \nbanished him.\n\nHumiliated, the young ninja wandered for years. His bitterness turned to \nambition, and he began to train others in the style of the shadows. As his \npower grew, so did his circle of followers, but he knew that without the \nbox, his technique would never be perfect. One day, Zed looked at his \nfollowers and saw that his students were now an army. He led them back to \nthe temple to claim his prize. At the gates, he was surprised to find the \nold master waiting, receiving Zed and his disciples as if they were welcome \nguests. The old man laid his sword at Zed's feet, declaring that he had \nfailed Zed as his master. By banishing his former student, the master had \ndoomed Zed to the shadows, instead of leading him to the balanced path. The \nold man implored Zed to enter the temple, destroy the box, and lead his \nfollowers to balance. The dark ninja followed the master inside. Moments \nlater, the assembled ninjas heard Zed cry out in pain. Mysteriously, he \nemerged unscathed, and threw the severed head of the master at Shen's feet. \nScreaming in rage, Zed commanded his followers to slaughter the master's \nstudents and seize the box.\n\nThat day, the old ninja order fell. Though many students died, some escaped \nthanks to Shen's heroic efforts. Now the temple is a dark training ground \nfor the Order of the Shadow. Zed rules as the Order's master, and his edict \nis simple: perfect one's technique, and kill all ninjas who refuse to \nembrace the shadows.\ufeff",
