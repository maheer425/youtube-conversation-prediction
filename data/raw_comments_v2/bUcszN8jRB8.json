Probably isn't even downtown Boise. \nYou're free to limbo.\n\nGive this comment a like if you want to see Jay-Z give a rock to a fish, \nand we'll send this to him as a petition.\n\nThis is not my favorite BLR for the actual words (while this certainly \nranks quite high, I think the \"2013 Independent Movie Awards\" one is the \nbest for laugh factor and has the perfect balance between too boring and \ntoo nonsensical), however it is a spectacular song. I love the first verse: \ngreat beat, catchy tune, and lyrics that have that perfect humoristic \nbalance. \"That dope fiend wanted to strip naked and think/Now she's rolling \nlike a pimp, yeah/Gonna send flowers to all my foes/Drive a Mexican cab to \nthe store/Stink and sweat out the juice we got in there/I'm damp for the \neasy muffin.\"\nNot too boring, not too nonsensical.
