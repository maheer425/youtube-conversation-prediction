You need to coordinate ahead of time with the locals \nso that they can pick you up from the catamaran, but its worth it. The \nreason why I recommend this village so much is that at the airport and in \nDenarau, many companies will try to sell you boat tours to \"villages\". Some \nmay be the real deal, but in truth, many of them are cheaply-constructed \ntourist attractions for tourists. Somosomo is nearly completely untouched \nothers, except for a small camp used by a volunteering group for teenagers \nthat drops in every once in a while (how I went there). When you go, be \nsure to bring kava root to present to the lady chief, so that you will be \naccepted in to the village, and you may be able to drink it later in a kava \nceremony with the villagers. This place has stuck with me my whole life. If \nyou want the real native experience, go to Somosomo. \n2. Since when is it only a two and a half hour drive from Nadi to Suva? It \ntook me four hours at minimum on the Queen's highway. \n3. There is excellent dolphin spotting on the east coast of Viti Levu. Take \na small chartered boat out into the water and look down. I personally \nrecommend Half-Moon Bay. Its a dolphin sanctuary that few ever visit. \nVinaka vakalevu for visiting my favorite country in the world!\ufeff",
