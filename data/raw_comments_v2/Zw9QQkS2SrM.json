And I told her that maybe you should \nlighten up on the spray tan you look like an orange, and I walked away. She \nand her friends where speechless XD lol.

Mutation of genes is always possible, therefore you can \nhave a mixed race kid who looks completely white because in that case the \ngenes carrying dominant alleles sort of \"break\" and behave like recessive \nones, which are responsible for lighter colors such as blonde hair, fair \nskin, blue eyes, etc. So basically a completely white child born in a mixed \nrace relationship is possible, only very, very, very rare.

Now \nI like the story and I like to share it. \n\nFor all the bully victims stand up, you don't have to hit someone like I \ndid. My friend was bullied, too (because she was fat and foreign), and she \ntold me once she didn't care at all, because she had friends. So don't care \nabout bullies, don't give them any power over you. Looking for something \nyou like and do it and look for friends who like you how you are. You're \nlucky to be born these days, thanks internet you can find easier some who \nwent through the same (look at all these comments on this video). You're \nnot alone and you're great. There is a place for you in the world. And like \nthe one woman wrote it makes you stronger. I know it's hard but I believe \neveryone can go through the hell of being bullied by focus one the good \nthings in your life. And the best thing in your life is you. There will be \nalways bad things but you can make good things. Like you see in my story, \nin the end the bully is more scared than you (when you don't give him any \npower).\ufeff",

I wore baggy jeans, glasses, never brushed \nmy hair or teeth, my smile was crooked, and I rarely showered or bathed \nunless my mother made me. Three years later, I'm still bullied, but \nactually because I'm questioning. (I'm not sure if I'm bisexual or a \nlesbian.) I am doing a lot better socially now, however, than I was at a \nyoung age. I shower daily, brush my teeth, wear better clothing, brush my \nhair, shave, and all of that. I still wear glasses but I think I'm okay \nwith them. I'm also a little bit chunky, 5'3 and 140 pounds, but I still \nknow I'm cute. Honestly, the best advice I can give to any little girls who \nare being bullied is to take care of yourself and don't let them get to \nyou. Smile and wear your skin proudly because it is the only skin you'll \never have. -Nikki \u2665\ufeff",
