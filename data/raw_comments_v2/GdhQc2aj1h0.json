My whole life I'd done projects on him, watched his \nmovies, everything. I idolized the man because he always wanted to make \nothers happy, just like I did. I didn't know what to do so I called my mom \nand started to cry. All I could say was \"Robin Williams is dead\" and \ncontinue to cry. My mother thought at first I'd fallen for a hoax and \nlooked it up and remained in complete silence for minutes as I cried over \nthe phone. I remember saying to her when I was little \"Mom, it's going to \nsuck the day he dies\" and she said \"Don't ever say that\". He helped me get \nthrough so much with my ADHD, bullying, anxiety, depression... Now I watch \nEllen everyday and she's become my new idol, helping me get through \neveryday. I'd always answered \"Robin\" when people asked me the celebrity \nI'd like to meet. Now, one day, I'll meet Ellen and tell her my \nstory. Thank you so much, Ellen.\ufeff",
