It's clear from the way he \ninter-comments about Martha and the audience in general that he knew \nexactly what kind of response he would get from this crowd. He is doing \nthis for the viewers and also to make a point.\nOn a side note, I know Burr loves sexist jokes, but this time it was kind \nof weak.
