If they had no mistakes America \nwouldn't be \"the best country on earth to me.\" America most certainly is \nnot weak. But England was coming off the \"most powerful country in the \nworld\" title at that time, and choosing to fight rather than negotiate \nwasn't what I would call a good move. Our navy may be mighty now but that \nwas started in 1812 when we started to take interest in naval combat. I \nalso would like to point out that Napoleon was beaten by a huge coalition, \nnotably England. I was simply trying to get rid of people thinking that \nEngland declared war in 1812, when they were simply trying to pick on what \nthey still considered a weaker country for more naval troops. Originally it \nwas just supposed to be Englishmen who moved to America (who were still \ncitizens), but they didn't care when those born American were abducted. I \ncan also say that many of the \"war hawks\" of the war of 1812 probably just \nwanted a war. I agree, America fought extremely well in that war, but it \nwasn't the smartest decision. It worked out, though, to some extent like \nthe declaration of independence. It was idiocy, but we managed to pull \nthrough, and Americans managed to found the country that will stand in \nhistory as the land of the free and the home of the brave (a line that \nproves the war of 1812 wasn't entirely useless...

And why dont you go to any gun free zone if you \nthat topics even a discussion. Chicagos a good start, or any of those \nsocialist places you dont have a problem with.

Both parties have flaws (I don't see why \nthere's so much hate over gun control. Just debate it out, see wins, and \naccept it.
