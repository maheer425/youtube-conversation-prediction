It's probably not true, but it's really \nstrange how sometimes I'll come home and my dog is really quiet, has her \nears back, and kind of just slowly walks away. I then notice that she \npooped, and right when she sees me look at the poop, she runs away before I \ncan yell at her. I'm sure it's not guilt, and that she just doesn't want me \nto yell at her, but isn't that kind of the same? Like she knows what she \ndid wrong and now she's upset because she knows she's going to get yelled \nat. \ufeff",
