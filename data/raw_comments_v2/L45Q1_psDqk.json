It \npresupposes that \"you\" is real and the world is in the \"phaneron\", so the \ndivision exists, and that is the paradox. A more clear thinking will show \nthat that division is an assumption (it is created by thought as what you \ncall phaneron), so to call the existence \"phaneron\" or \"reality\" is the \nsame. In other words, \"you\" is also the phaneron, or reality (at this point \nboth are the same). What exists is an unlimited whole process of movement \nwhich ultimately is unknowable (we agree there), because knowledge is made \nof finite things. The egocentric predicament is the normal way of thinking, \ni think that paradox is challenging us to get a more general comprehension \nof reality, which includes both the phaneron and reality in a more general \nprocess, so the division between \"me\" and the world is valid up to a \ncertain point, but not fundamentally true.\n\ngreetings!
