I was playing on my own and \nsaying that I was a pretty mermaid. One of my sisters overheard me and told \nme I wasn't pretty.\n\nAt some point in my childhood I accepted the fact I wasn't pretty. In the \nnature of sour grapes, I told myself I didn't want to be pretty anyways. \nAnd because I felt I wasn't pretty, I didn't do anything to fix myself up \nbecause I'd still be ugly anyways. Of course, this made me look worse in \ncomparison to all my peers who were wearing pretty clothes, had fixed up \nhair, and wore nice makeup. I didn't get any reinforcement from my peers, \nand was actually bullied for how \"ugly\" I was in middle school. \n\nNow I'm in college and I'm just starting to realize I'm not as ugly as I \nhave always believed I've been. I don't feel pretty; but I realize I'm not \nugly. I realize that the beauty standards my elders follow are just that: \nstandards. And that people usually praise features that are unique, but \nhaving basic features doesn't make you ugly.\n\nI also realize that my peers were cruel because we were at an age of \nconformity, and the negligence of my appearance is what made them look down \non me (not trying to justify it.)... I've also realized I'm cuter than the \nsister who called me ugly, so there's that :)\ufeff",

How many people do you come into contact with that really truly \ncare about what makes you who you are?\nAnd even family, as much as they love you, can make you feel like you're \nlacking.\nIt's difficult in this life to hold onto whatever value you can assign \nyourself.. and made even more difficult when you have to factor in how \nother people value you.\nBottom line: it's hard no matter what. The best we can do is hold our heads \nup and go for it. If someone doesn't like it, someone else will. The \nquestion is, \"Do you like it?\"\ufeff",

Granted, there aren't many that \nwould objectify a man on his manhood, and look past that, but I am speaking \nfor the majority. Even if a woman was flat-chested, she could get breast \nimplants. If a man has a 10 centimetre penis, then there is next to nothing \nhe can do. He has to play the cards, that he was dealt.\n\nYes, that guy with a small penis will learn how to master oral sex, but \nthat doesn't stop a man with a Ron Jeremy sized penis from becoming an oral \nsex master as well.\n\nMen have less criteria for a mate, rather than women. I know many men that \nwill touch anything that has two legs, and is breathing. I don't think \nthere are women that are that way, and if there was, I have yet to meet \none, and I have met MANY women.\n\nI have seen many women post pictures of men, with muscular builds, and say \nsexual things about them. \n\nI am sick of the objectifying shown by shallow women. It isn't helping that \nthere is a movement that tries for equal rights for women? It's called \nFeminism? Hypocrisy is all I see.\n\nI am sorry, but this what I see.\n\nPS, do not say that I have a micropenis or anything related, as I do not \nhave one. I am about 15 cm in length, and about 13 cm around.
