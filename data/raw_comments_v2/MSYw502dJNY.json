            "text": "A Shot in the Dark Aimed at John Green, \n\nHi there Mr. Green, I'm a huge fan of your work and love the crash-course \nvideos, particularly the ones pertaining to poetics. You're description of \nPlath was extensive and sensitive, two words which I often use to describe \nPlath herself. Well done and thank you. I was wondering if a request could \nbe made... Is it possible for you to conduct a crash-course related to the \nfeminist poetry of Adrianne Rich, Anne Sexton, or Audre Lorde? I understand \nthat this is a big bite to chew. But c'mon. It would be awesome. \n\nThanks, Nanu Nanu, Hugs, \n\nGabby Reamer \ufeff",
