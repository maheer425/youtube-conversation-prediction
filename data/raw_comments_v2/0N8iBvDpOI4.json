Next, pour a bunch of salt and \npepper onto the piece of paper. Stir them around with your finger. Last of \nall, fill a glass up with water. Then have your friend come into the room. \nWhen they come in take a small dip of the water (this is not neccesary, but \nthey will think the water is for drinking.) and make sure that the sip is \nsmall and will not take very much water out. Then bet your friend that you \ncan separate the salt and pepper in less than ten seconds. Show them how \nwell mixed the salt and pepper are. Then, when they bet on it, pour all the \nsalt and pepper into the water (this is why you creased the paper) and the \npepper will float on top, and the salt will sink to the bottom.\ufeff",
