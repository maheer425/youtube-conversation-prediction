I can't answer that-The cons will hate him but if he's popular \nwith his liberal base he'll easily overcome the right wing attacks.  In \nSouth Africa he is very popular with white South Africans(including older \nwhites) but then in SA if your dad is white like Trevor's you aren't \nconsidered black. Bill O'Reilly hates Jon Stewart with a passion- have you \nseen their interactions in the past?  I'm sure Bill will be all over him \nbut Trevor's got a large white liberal fan base- as long as he doesn't \nalienate women, gays and jews as they are a powerful base who watch the \ndaily show. I don't think he s prejudiced against those 3 groups, I just \nthink he needs to realize in USA you need to be more PC when joking about \nfat girls, effeminate gays, holocaust etc",
