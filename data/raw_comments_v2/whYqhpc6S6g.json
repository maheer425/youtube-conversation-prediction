To proof they both have the same area, \nfirst we need to show the base layer is the same. Second, we need to show \nthat for each dS in radius we decrease, the area shrunk is linear since the \nside of the triangle is linear.\n\nThe outermost ring in the circle has a radius of r, and is dR wide. The \narea would be 2\u03c0rdR.\nFor the triangle, he defined the bottom side to be 2\u03c0r, which gives us an \narea of 2\u03c0rdR.\nSo they are the same.\n\nNow, if we shrink the ring by an infinitesimal amount dS, we get an area of \n2\u03c0(r-dS)dR. The difference between the larger ring and the smaller ring in \narea will be 2\u03c0rdR - 2\u03c0(r - dS)dR = 2\u03c0dRdS\n\nHere, it shows that each \"smaller\" rings will have an area smaller by a \nconstant amount. This holds true for every r you pick, which r < R, the \nradius of the circle, or the height of the triangle.\n\nSince both bases have the same area, and they both decreases by a constant \namount when r (radius in circle or height in triangle) gets smaller, and I \nhave showed that for all r, that means they both have the same area.",

You can deduce that by looking at his english \nlevel and his profile picture together with his alleged uncapability to \ncomprehend the simple maths of the area of a circle. A little research also \nshows you that, in Brazil, 7th graders are around twelve years old, and \nbeing fluent in a second language ( specially the ones that aren't derived \nfrom latin, like spanish and french) in the country, is a very rare skill. \nI am brazilian myself, and got the hold of english about 1 year younger \nthan he is now and I am now starting my fourth language now, which is \ngerman, and I am happy to see a young boy like him already interested in \nscience and trying his best to delve into another language, even if it's \nthe popular stuff like in this page.
