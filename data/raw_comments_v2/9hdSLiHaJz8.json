According to \nmaslow you must satisfy one level before moving on. Thus physiological \nneeds must be satisfied before anything else, then you move on to safety \nneeds, and then to the need to belong. Its not saying that the need to \nbelong is more important than hunger, just that physiological needs such as \nhunger must be satisfied before the need to belong. Of course this is not \nalways the case, at times you can have motivations that will mess with this \nhierarchy. An example would be say ignoring your need for sleep or food and \npulling an all nighter to study for a huge test. Im sure there are better \nexamples than this, but this is what i could come up with. I hope this \nhelps, and sorry in advance if it doesn't. Im not the best at explaining \nthings,maybe someone can provide a better answer. ",
