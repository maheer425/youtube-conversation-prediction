Their point of view was that every country should be for the \nmembers of its own race, e.g. China should be for Chinese people, African \ncountries for African people etc. So, since America was founded by white \nEuropeans, the country should mainly be for them, and other races should \nlive in their own respective countries. Contrary to popular belief, it's \nnot necessarily founded on some irrational hatred of black people and \nminorities, but on a desire to preserve all racial purity.",

We can make it free. Hell we give \nout welfare like candy. It's not difficult. \n\nBut you have Democrats like \"it's racist to ask for IDs. whites will be \nable to get in with just a crude crayon drawing of their face and \nminorities can have 10 forms of IDs and be rejected\" or \"minorities are too \npoor to get any form of IDs.\" And I am here as a Republican like \"it's not \nthe Democrat Jim crow laws days. It be a standard photo ID which can be \nmade free. And not all minorities are helpless people, in fact they can \ntake care of themselves and don't need government to coddle them\" which \nthen the Democrats will start over again calling me racist. \n\nI am going to say this once.

And you should have for when \nvoting having your voters card and some form of photo identification does \nnot mean that you are a racist or sexist person. It means you think they \nare as equal to you and we all should be held to the same standard. And \ndon't need help getting a job or get into college or whatever. They can do \nit on their own without help and can succeed.\"\n\nAlso who gave the stereotype that blacks are hood rats and gangsters and \nonly true goal in life is rapping? Hollywood and what political spectrum is \nHollywood. Democrat. A majority of Hollywood movies with minorities place \nthem as some hoodrat or gangster or thug. That's Hollywood. Even if they \nshow a rich minority person he is stereotypical of that race which \nHollywood makes worse. \n\nThe moment we realize that being a hood rat. Gangster or want-a-be rapper \nis really bad thing and stop allowing Hollywood pumping out racist and \nstereotypical portals of minorities. Take the best people for the job no \nmatter what the race or background and doesn't need to be told to hire \nsomeone.

I \nwill be willing to listen to your reasons for not liking it but it's my \nopinion we should be allowed to say our opinions. Now minus any like real \nhate talk like the KKK or new nazi party. Or the new black panthers. Those \npeople's hate speech is in called for and I agree that is not right but it \nis people who need to stop it and not the government. You see 10 west \nburrow Baptist protesters with signs saying \"god hates fags\" and shit like \nthat. You get 200 people with signs saying \"god loves everyone\" \"god loves \nfags\" that's how you silence hate. You show that there is more love than \nhate. \n\nSorry for the long post and rantish stuff. I just don't like his stupid \npolitical comments in there.

After the \ncollapse of the Whig party, the Republican party formed in 1852 for the \nprimary purpose of opposing the spread of slavery. After the civil war, \nfractures in both political parties started to reveal, being further \napparent in the Progressive Era where two different Republican Presidents \nbasically ran on RINO politics (Roosevelt and Taft). It finally came to a \nhead in 1963, When a Democratic lead congress passed the Civil Rights act \nthat was signed by a Democratic president. a lot of the people who \nsupported segregation and despised the Civil Rights Movement abandoned the \nDemocrats all together (it's why if you go to a KKK style demonstration or \nmeeting, they don't really talk about themselves having liberal values, and \nthey are more in line with a specific type of conservatism, obviously \nwithin the lines of the racism their promoting.)
