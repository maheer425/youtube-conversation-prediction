            "text": "well alligators only move in short bursts of powerful energy. it's an \nadaptation. they have immense muscular power, but their body proportions \nand angles are specifically adapted for hiding in shallow water. in \nlaymen's terms, they're shitty at running. they fucking suck at it. they're \ngood at one thing: biting. though they are capable of walking for a few \nminutes, they typically conserve their energy. it's also a psychological \nadaptation. when threatened, they will do what they do best: react \nextremely quickly, and with extreme strength; if they fail to bite you on \nthe first try, it's pretty much over. but that first snap will be very \nfast, so they often succeed. people have been killed by alligators. but \nthey do not \"thrash about.\" they are stealth animals. they snap, and then \nrelax their muscles, slow their heart rate, and chill for the next 30 \nminutes. by that point, they will have relaxed and grown comfortable with \nwhatever human is handling them. they're really not especially violent or \nangry animals. they just happen to look vicious, but in reality they're \npretty humane about eating prey. the nature of their mouths mean the deaths \nof their prey are quick and painless. to put it simply, there is no \nbiological need for an alligator to have extensive stamina. they don't need \nto thrash about. all they need to do, 99 times out of 100, is snap and eat. \nexpending more energy than that would be very wasteful. this is hard for \nhumans to imagine, because our muscular strength is distributed throughout \nour bodies. alligators, on the other hand, are pretty much all jaw and \ntail. a bite from a large alligator can exert a force of over a ton. that's \nlike being underneath a car, which is balanced on top of a rack of sharp \nteeth, digging directly into you. all that force takes a lot of energy. \nthey're adapted for basically one strategy, and they're really good at it. \nthis is how most apex predators are. it's also why apex predators are often \nthe most vulnerable to extinction. have you noticed that animals at the top \nof the food chain are often endangered? they are the animals most likely to \ngo extinct, throughout history. so considering that their bite takes up so \nmuch energy, and that's about all they're good for, they're pretty \ndefenseless against a human that understands alligator physiology. a human \nthat doesn't know alligators might fall prey to a small one like this, but \na trained human? even a child could take down that gator. it's really very \nsmall. all you need to do is get behind it and hold down its tail and neck. \nor sit on its back. they're basically defenseless at that point. not very \nflexible creatures. you don't seem to notice it, but this woman has the \nalligator potentially pinned down. finally, if the alligator were to bite \nher, it wouldn't be likely to cause a serious injury. their teeth are \nrather dull, and they don't tear apart animals that are larger than them. \nthey crush small animals in their huge mouths, and swallow them whole. \nsometimes, if the opportunity provides, they will have a feeding frenzy on \na larger animal. but it will take them a loooong time to consume the \nanimal. they can only take slow bites. crocodiles, on the other hand, have \nmuch sharper teeth and can pick apart larger animals more easily. so if \nthis alligator managed to clamp onto her arm, for example, it wouldn't do \nany immediate damage. it would just stay clamped on, hoping it would tire \nher out. since they can hold a light grip for days, that works in the wild. \nbut in this case, someone would wrangle or tazer the alligator, and it'd be \nover. she might have mildly broken skin, but no serious damage.",
