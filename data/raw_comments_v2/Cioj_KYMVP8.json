Water in the mix \nis the fuel for the reaction that takes place inside the concrete as it \nsets. Once concrete is \"dry\" it has used all the water included in the mix \nand the chemical reaction inside has stopped.\n\nThe reason I bring this up is because drying is the worst way to describe \nwhat happens when concrete sets because it encourages people to let \nconcrete get dry quickly when it actually needs as much moisture around it \nas possible while setting to help keep it cool and to prevent the reaction \nfrom running out of water before it properly binds all the particles inside \nthe mixture. Concrete setting under water is the best method of curing \nconcrete and is the method used to test concrete samples according to \nBritish Standard EN 12390 Part 2: Making and Curing Specimens for Strength \nTests.\n\nSource - Civil Engineering student doing a 3rd Year project on steel fibre \nreinforced concrete, UK University of Portsmouth.\ufeff",
