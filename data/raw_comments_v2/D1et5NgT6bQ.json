When a male becomes erect, \nthe prostate gland become enlarged and constricts the uretrha, stopping (or \nat least making it more difficult) to urinate. See diagram: \nhttp://www.mastersmensclinic.com/prostate1.jpg\n\nThis helps not only to make it less likely to urinate during sleep, but it \nstops the male from being able to urinate during sexual intercourse as \nwell, blocking off access to the bladder so that only semen is allowed to \nescape. Basically like a back up valve to stop anything from becoming \nbacked up the wrong way.\n\nIn terms of masturbation, sure, a lot of guys will do that in the morning \nbecause in the morning male testosterone levels (the main sex hormone) is \nthe highest, which is one of the reasons why morning erections occur so \nnaturally masturbation is common depending on the age of the male.\n\nDoes it go away when you urinate? Well, since the prostate contracts onto \nthe urethra it becomes almost impossible to urinate, which leaves a lot of \nguys in an uncomfortable position over the toilet, impatiently awaiting \ntheir erection to go away so that they can urinate.\n\nAnd yes, like any state of arousal, it goes away by itself, if it doesn't \nthere's a medical problem. It's never a good sign to have an erection last \na long period of time. Points to a problem with blood flow.",
