Hardly conducive to a perceived epidemic of irrationalism or \nhoplophobia.\nAs for Canada being the \"home of hoplophobes\" I guess to ammosexuals who \nare I suspect biologically deficient in some other areas, that might seem \nto be the case. The majority of Canadians I would venture however do not \ngrow up in a gun-loving culture. They have no real-world experience \nhandling or even firing firearms. And living in a country which values the \nconcept of a \"civil society,\" far more than an armed society, we certainly \ndon't see the need for citizens to be owning firearms except for the \nnecessity of wilderness survival (or hunting), but that does not mean we \nwholesale deny them from doing so, so long as they can demonstrate a \nreasonable level of competency in owning, handling and storing firearms so \nthey do not fall into the hands of criminals or worse, into the hands of \nchildren.\nAnd before you call me a hoplophobe, I spent 15 years in the CF. And in \nthat time, I have fired almost every weapon in the CF inventory from .22 \ncal insert on the FN-C1, to the 105mm (106) recoilless anti-tank rifle. I \nam certainly no hoplophobe, but I also to this day have never personally \nowned a firearm, or felt the need to own one.

I don't particularly worry about being \nshot and if I'm robbed, it's only money and it can be replaced.  Why would \none need to be protected, it is very unlikely I would ever get into a \nsituation where my life was threatened.\n\nIf I were going to the woods then, maybe I would need protection from large \nanimals, but I wouldn't get into a situation where I would ever meet \nsomeone who would threaten my life.  It's just not something I, as a \nCanadian am concerned about.\n\nSo when American's come up to Canada, you should understand there isn't the \nfeeling that we need self protection.  We have police to take care of \ndomestic incidences and robberies.  You're welcome to come and visit, but \nunless you're going to a slum (and I can't think of where there is one, in \nmy own city) or are putting yourself into a situation where you are \ninvolved with drugs, just relax and enjoy yourselves!\n-----\nAs far as I know, it is illegal to use deadly force to defend yourself in \nCanada.\n-----\nOn your second point: Corporate greed involves paying off politicians and \nlobbyist, so they don't represent the will of the people.  Profits come \nbefore jobs and jobs end up being sent over-seas.  Money and profit come \nbefore people.\n\nGovernments lobby for free trade to appease corporations and jobs flow out \nof the country.\n\nYour banks put the entire world into a recession in 2008 that we still \nhaven't recovered from!\n\nA lot of people around the world lost jobs, permanently and there are \ncities that have lost so much tax base that they can't balance their budget.\n\nYou end up with more crime and not enough police.\n\nYou or I being greedy wouldn't have an effect on the entire country, but \ncorporate greed, treating corporations as people and other such non-sense \nthat corporations have lobbied for have reduced democracy and caused a lot \nof people to have a self defence mentality instead of one of co-operation.\n-----\nI would say repealing corporate rights to person-hood, and re-level the \npolitical system to represent local people, jobs and rights.\n\nThat would alleviate a lot of issues with jobs.  States can get back to \ndoing what is right for it's citizens (protecting local jobs and what is \nbest for the local economy and environment instead of outside \ncorporations), instead of what makes money for a cash strapped state, in \nthe short term (e.g. for profit state prisons.)",
