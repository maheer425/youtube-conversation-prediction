Build a gigantic island of solar panels on one of our oceans and use \nit to power a super strong laser shot at the surface of Mars. The laser \nwould heat the area it hits so hot that the iron oxide starts to melt. Once \na lake of molten iron oxide forms, send a spacecraft with a factory setup \nto plant itself near the molten iron oxide. The factory uses a gigantic \narray of heat energy based thermocouples to create gigantic electricity. \nThis electricity is used to perform electrolysis on the molten iron oxide. \nThis releases a TON of oxygen into Mars's atmosphere. As an atmosphere \nbegins to form, the planet becomes warmer and the ice caps melt, releasing \neven more atmospheric gasses. The atmosphere would be about 70% oxygen, 20% \nwater, and 8% CO2. The rest would be trace gasses. Carbon is pretty rare in \nthe universe but some asteroids might have methane in them. Tie some nukes \nto the asteroids and propel them into Mars. Nitrogen is even harder to get \nbut certain nuclear explosions can artificially convert elements to \ncarbon. \ufeff",
