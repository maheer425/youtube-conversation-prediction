Sonic, on the other hand, reaches these speeds solely \non his own ability (occasionally utilizing speed shoes to increase his \nspeed even further). However, that being said, Sonic arguably has a unique \nDNA sequence that would create various loopholes to the typical conditions \nan average humanoid would need in order to perform these speeds.\n\nFurthermore, since the point of these videos is to be very technical, one \nmust also consider that the laws of physics applied to Sonic's universe \narguably differ greatly from those found in our own universe. After all, \nEggman's hovercraft is able to hover with very little energy usage and \nalmost zero exhaust or thrust. His hovercraft never affects the environment \nwhile it hovers - no wind blowing against the grass or trees like a \nhelicopter or anything. Also, Tails is capable of twirling his two tails in \nsuch a way as to fly like a helicopter. It's arguable that the size of his \ntails, coupled with being covered in fur, cannot possibly create the lift \nneeded for him to fly in our universe.\n\nFinally, returning to the idea that Shadow manipulates spacetime with the \nChaos Emeralds, we can safely assume that the laws of physics as we know \nthem simply cannot be applied to Sonic's universe because we have no known \nway to prove that it is truly possible to bend spacetime as would be needed \nto warp through it as Shadow does. Not to mention, in Sonic Generations, \nEggman introduces the Time Eater, who is capable of distorting spacetime to \nwarp anyone and anything anywhere and anywhen. All things consider, we can \nsafely assume that the laws of physics as we know them are completely \ninapplicable to Sonic's universe.\ufeff",

One I made myself but \nfollowing the \"Future Earth\" and \"Sister Planet\" idea combined with \nevolution and the \"video games tell our future\" theory made by Matt Patt of \nGame theory.\nSister Planet: Mobius the Sister Planet is known for a roleplaying world \nwhere Sonic characters thrive. It's bigger and at the exact opposite side \nof the sun making this unstable according to real life physics.\n[Source: A blog]\nThe Gene Bomb (officially made by Archie): In an issue of their comics, \nSonic had two flashbacks showing the start of Mobius. The first was when \nthese aliens wanted revenge from being dissected by the government and \ncreated a type of bomb that they planned to use to send humans back to \ntheir stone age stage of evolution. Something went wrong and humans and \nanimals genes tied in together cuing evolution between all species, \nincluding humans.\nSecond official start: In this one, Eggman and Sonic already exists. Eggman \nhad a plan to take over by....y'know what? I can't remember all.\n[sources: Sonic the Hedgehog's wiki]\nMine: After the events of \"The Last of Us\" some survivors were in space \nfinding a new livable planet. They created their own language after \nhundreds of years of their search because the other languages fell apart \nwith the word \"mobius\" meaning \"miracle\" or \"new hope\", even sometimes used \nas \"new life\". But, \"new life\" is hardly used because they had a different \nword for it. They found a planet with oxygen, water, and plants. Little did \nthey know is that it's already populated by species from Earth and aliens \nthat are guarding those creatures during their evolution. The humans named \nthe planet \"Mobius\" after their word \"mobius\", because it was a miracle \nthat they found new life to them. Over the years, Legends of Zelda and \nMario happened along with other video game worlds. It could be possible \nthat there was no werehog in Sonic Unleashed, but, infact, Sonic, if he's \nalive in the distant future in the last stage of evolution. The proof could \nbe that he could stretch longer, helping him catch things and climb onto \nobjects, which the fingernails help. Showing what Mobians look like when \ntheir world finally ends.\n[source: my imagination]\n\nSo, no matter what, one of these four could be true or that Mobius would \nforever remain fictional. But, who knows? There might be a blue hedgehog \nrunning in this world that fast....",

This is most interesting since to battle \nyour theory of how much energy sonic uses, if we estimate that each power \nring can power a planet, and it is estimated that sonic on average in a \nstage collects 250-500 power rings a \"stage\" that sonic is having or \nobtaining more than enough energy to sustain his energy consumption and \ncompensate for drag, which also seems to apply to chaos emeralds, which put \nout 10x more energy than the big bang or akashic field theory. Which would \nexplain why sonic can achieve the speed of light as well as exceed it in \nsuper sonic form. all in all it is quite awesome to me, that the game \ndesigner for the sonic games, has most likely accidentally or sub \nconsciously accounted for these scientific facts and made a video game \ncharacter that seemingly defies logic and physics actually have a logical \nconclusion that alines with reality. In other words, i think its cool that \nsonic doesn't actually defy  the laws of physics do to his environment, \nbody type, and existence as objects that generate high amounts of energy :D\ufeff",
