For example we do not use the word come as a \ncommand for our dogs to come to us. We use a different word and they come \nto us every single time not because of the word we use but because of how \nwe said it and they know that when we say that word they get the greatest \ntreat of all, their caviar so to speak. When our dogs do something we are \nnot happy with we have never used bad dog. In our house (and from what I \nhave seen of these video's they don't either) bad dog means they did \nsomething naughty but not something bad. Bad dog does not have a negative \nconnection to them. It typically means we are laughing and they get a pet \nout of the encounter. If I say ack to them however they respond \ndifferently. They know that ack is serious and they better stop what they \nare doing.",

Then you need to readjust the \ncarburetor every time there's a major change in temperature. You have to \nalways carry a spare glow plug around with you, and if the engine stalls, \nthere's always the hassle of taking the body off and the danger of burning \nyour fingers. \nAnd if the dogs go after the buggy, they're all the more in danger of \ninhaling the nasty exhaust gases (if they make my eyes and nose itch, when \nI get too close, I don't want to know how that feels for a dog). And of \ncourse you can't drive around without the body, or your dog will probably \nburn its nose on the muffler sooner or later.\nAlso, when you've got to refuel, you'll be handling a rather toxic liquid \nwith your dogs probably jumping around in excitement next to you, and you \nknow how some dogs like to sample literally everything that could possibly \nbe bad for them.",
