            "text": "In any relationship, couples will have their share of arguments and fights. \nThat's reality and the truth. But yeah, I was watching this video, and I \nwas thinking, I have rarely been late when it comes to dressing up and \nputting on makeup. My boyfriends didn't have to wait for me like the guy in \nthis video when it came to me dressing up and putting on makeup. Like the \ngal in this video, I do drive a Honda, and I do like it when guys can show \ntheir soft side and cry. That's endearing - when a guy can cry and show \nvulnerability. I do agree with the gal when she said that sometimes some \nguys don't apologize enough or make their girlfriends feel appreciated or \nfeel sexy or attractive. I feel that guys need to give some special \ncompliments - at least a medium amount - to make their partners and \ngirlfriends feel desired, attractive, sexy, loved, appreciated, good, \namazing, etc.\n\nTo not give compliments to your girlfriend, partner, etc. is like not \nputting any fuel, water, sun to make the relationship stay strong, grow \nhealthy, or stay alive. To fail to give compliments is like letting plants \ndie, neglecting maintaining a car, etc. To fail to give compliments is like \nletting a relationship die. All relationships need SOME maintenance aka \nwarmth, love, affection, compliments, making partner feel very special, \netc., or they will fall apart and die. To not take good care of a \ngirlfriend, partner, etc. is like not taking good care of a car, plant, \npet, etc. It's letting something die or fall apart. Also, when you are a in \nrelationship with someone, you need to tell that person what makes that \nperson more special than others. Why be in a relationship with someone if \nyou can't say, express, communicate, articulate, or share often to that \nperson what makes them stand out and what makes them MORE special than \nother people? \n\nRegarding arguments - I will never understand why some couples argue over \nwhat restaurant to go to each week, what movies to watch, what concert to \nattend, etc. I feel if a couple loves each other and respects each other - \nthen they will care about making each other happy, and learn to be fair, be \nmore selfless, and compromise. For me, when I was in relationships - I \nwould have my then boyfriends choose what restaurant they wanted to visit, \nwhat movie they wanted to go for one week, & THEN the next week was my \nchoice of restaurant and movie to go to. Each month or every other month - \nI would go to a concert or event the boyfriend liked or wanted to attend, \nTHEN the next month, etc., the boyfriend would go to a concert or event I \nwanted to attend. I've dated some of the most picky and finicky eaters - \nand we made things fair by taking turns on what restaurants and foods we \nate. We took turns each week - and we were able to try new foods, new \nevents, new movies, new places this way. It's about being thoughtful, \ntrying new things and adventures TOGETHER, being sweet, selfless, \nconsiderate, loving, respectful of each other and caring about making each \nother happy.\n\nA happy partner - happy boyfriend and happy girlfriend - equals happy life. \nWhy fight over movies, restaurants, events, concerts, activities, food, \netc. when you CAN take turns each week and be fair, compromise, and be \nconsiderate and respectful of each other? What matters the most is spending \nand sharing time with that person. So, taking turns, sharing, and \ncompromising AND alternating choices and picks from you and your partner \nEACH week when it comes to your partner, girlfriend, boyfriend in the \nactivities and things you do with each other IS the best policy.
