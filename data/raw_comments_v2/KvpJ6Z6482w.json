I watched another vid that said the same thing and they \nacted like it was the greatest and most bizare discovery ever. I mean, no \nmatter what you believe in, religion or science, at some point there were \nonly two of whoever our ancestor/species is. So we are all related, its \ninarguable. Like i really dont get it, how is so weird that all blue eyed \npeople share the same ancestor when we ALL share the same ancestor up the \nline. plus, who is to say that the mutation of blue eyes isnt random. They \nare assuming that that one guy who developed blue eyes was the only one. \nHow can they know this? Downs Syndrome is a mutation. I dont see people \nsayng all people with Downs share the same ancestor. And what about the \nother eye colors? Green, hazel, even red has been reported in few cases. \nIts random, I really dont see how it means all blue eyed people share ONE \ncommon ancestor with blue eyes. Mutations are random! Yes, they can become \ntraits over time (the fur of polar bears was once a mutation!) and maybe \nthat blue eyed person 10,000 years ago was the first one and maybe he did \npass on his mutation to his desecendants. Big deal. Thats genetics. But \nsaying ALL blue eyed people are his ancestor is ignorant. I mean, if he was \nthe first one that means he didnt get it from one of his ancestors, which \nproves that a person having blue eyes can either be genetic or just a \nrandom mutation, as in his case.\ufeff",
