Hydrogen is indeed a fuel, and its fuel value it much \nhigher than any fossil fuel or hydrocarbon in existence per mass unit.  \nAlso, you had better learn about how a battery actually works.  The \nelectrolytic solution in batteries do not contain any \"pre-charge.\"  It is \nmerely an ionizable solution to have the ability to transfer electrons from \nthe anode to the cathode during electrochemical redox reactions.  Plus, I \nthink you meant to say high voltage currents and not \"high charge \ncurrents.\"  It does not mean the same thing, nor does the phrase make any \nsense.  A higher potential difference (i.e., voltage) can lessen the time \nrequired for recharging a battery, but not a high charge.  Charge can be \nthought of the actual number of electrons available to do work, so a \"high \ncharge current\" would only account for the amount of distance you could \npotentially get out of the battery, not the speed of charging.  The only \nthing that I see in your post that would work is Tesla's proposal for \nswappable batteries.  There is still a problem with that... weight.  It is \ntrue that hydrogen would carry a substantial initial expense, but I would \nhardly call it a waste if it eliminates our dependence on fossil fuels.",

The best solution to the problem would be the liquid \nfluoride thorium reactor.  It can actually use up some of the waste \nplutonium.  Thorium is also much more abundant than uranium, it doesn't \nneed enrichment to be used as fuel, and its waste products have a \nsignificantly shorter half-life.  Of course, the reason why they generally \nare not used in the U.S. is that thorium reactors do not produce weapons \ngrade fissile material.  I suppose if we can't blow it up, we don't want it.",

For \nexample, what do you do if you have to drive over 200 miles?  You can not \ndo that with electric vehicles.  Sure, you can just recharge them, but that \nusually takes several hours.  Hydrogen fueling stations could be a \nubiquitous as a normal petrol station if the infrastructure was in place.  \nThat means you can fuel up and be back on the road without waiting.  Before \neither alternative becomes possible, however, there will need to be a major \nshift in general electricity generation.  With current technology, the best \ncourse would be nuclear energy.
