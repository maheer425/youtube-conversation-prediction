            "text": "\"Statehood is eternal\"?  UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH no. CGP Grey should stick to his \nsilly cartoons and leave law to the scholars.,,, no wonder he plays so fast \nand loose with the facts.\n But here ARE the facts, for those rare few who are still interested in \nsuch things:\n\nLaw of Nations,  Book I, Chapter I, \u00a7 10: Of states forming a federal \nrepublic:\n*Finally, several sovereign and independent states may unite themselves \ntogether by a perpetual confederacy, without ceasing to be, each \nindividually, a perfect state. They will together constitute a federal \nrepublic: their joint deliberations will not impair the sovereignty of each \nmember, though they may, in certain respects, put some restraint on the \nexercise of it, in virtue of voluntary engagements. A person does not cease \nto be free and independent, when he is obliged to fulfil engagements which \nhe has voluntarily contracted.*\nThis ties into Federalist No. 39:\n*On examining the first relation, it appears, on one hand, that the \nConstitution is to be founded on the assent and ratification of the people \nof America, given by deputies elected for the special purpose; but, on the \nother, that this assent and ratification is to be given by the people, not \nas individuals composing one entire nation, but as composing the distinct \nand independent States to which they respectively belong. It is to be the \nassent and ratification of the several States, derived from the supreme \nauthority in each State, the authority of the people themselves. The act, \ntherefore, establishing the Constitution, will not be a NATIONAL, but a \nFEDERAL act.*\n*That it will be a federal and not a national act, as these terms are \nunderstood by the objectors; the act of the people, as forming so many \nindependent States, not as forming one aggregate nation, is obvious from \nthis single consideration, that it is to result neither from the decision \nof a MAJORITY of the people of the Union, nor from that of a MAJORITY of \nthe States. It must result from the UNANIMOUS assent of the several States \nthat are parties to it, differing no otherwise from their ordinary assent \nthan in its being expressed, not by the legislative authority, but by that \nof the people themselves. Were the people regarded in this transaction as \nforming one nation, the will of the majority of the whole people of the \nUnited States would bind the minority, in the same manner as the majority \nin each State must bind the minority; and the will of the majority must be \ndetermined either by a comparison of the individual votes, or by \nconsidering the will of the majority of the States as evidence of the will \nof a majority of the people of the United States. Neither of these rules \nhave been adopted.*\n*Each State, in ratifying the Constitution, is considered as a sovereign \nbody, independent of all others, and only to be bound by its own voluntary \nact. In this relation, then, the new Constitution will, if established, be \na FEDERAL, and not a NATIONAL constitution.*\n--The Federalist Papers : No. 39\nSo the USA is a federal republic, not a national one-- i.e. a purely \n*voluntary* association of sovereign nations, each ruled supremely by its \n*People.*\nThus since the states were legally sovereign nations by law,  the Lincoln \nregime accomplished its war by lies and *censorship,* locking up anyone who \ntold this truth, and even toruturing them with horrible tortures including \nshoving hoses down their throats and filing their lungs with water until \nthey exploded, in addition to running concentration-camps for anyone who \nresisted. THAT'S how they won the war.\nHowever with the internet and other modern technology, there's no longer \nany way to do this and get away with it; and so once the truth is known, \nthe end of tyranny will come not with a shout, but with a Twitter. Like \nwhen Mayor Daley's police beat up the Chicago protestors of the Vietnam \nwar, \"the whole world is blogging.\"\n\nIn contrast, here's the White House's official response to Texas's petition \nfor secession: \n*Our founding fathers established the Constitution of the United States \"in \norder to form a more perfect union\" through the hard and frustrating but \nnecessary work of self-government. They enshrined in that document the \nright to change our national government through the power of the ballot -- \na right that generations of Americans have fought to secure for all. But \nthey did not provide a right to walk away from it. As President Abraham \nLincoln explained in his @19 in 1861, \"in contemplation of universal law \nand of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual.\"*\nAs proven by the above passages, this is clearly a lie. And once this lie \nis exposed, and the People of each state learn that their state IS a \nsovereign nation-- and that they ARE the ruling sovereigns--  then that \nwill be the end of it, states will secede at whim..... just like they can \nsecede from the UN.\n\"The pen is mightier than the sword.. and the truth shall set you free.\" \n--Lord Byron and John 8:32\ufeff",
