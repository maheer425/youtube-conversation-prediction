Also, of course, there is a ton \nof evidence as to WMDs being found in Iraq and republicans have not wanted \nto bring a good deal of attention to it, though some have, because of not \nwanting word to spread that they failed in their efforts to both remove \nSaddam and at the same time contain his WMDs.  While the mainstream media, \non the other hand, and you personally, have so much invested in the \"George \nBush lied story,\" that you didn't want to talk about it.  While, of course, \nif anyone looks at the wikileaks documents they will find hundreds upon \nhundreds of references to WMDs (VX, Sarin, Mustard gas) and shells in Iraq \nand how they were dispersed throughout the country and ultimately came into \nthe hands of Al-Queda and subsequently, some, into the hands of the Islamic \nState.  Plenty of blame to go around on a lot of things, too.  Since we all \nknow, also, that President Bush's SEC leader could have done a better job \nof keeping an eye on Wall Street.  However, Bush actually did try very hard \nto get regulations in place to stop the housing debacle which wrecked the \neconomy.  Who fought those regulations all the way?  Barney Frank along \nwith Barak Obama.  Obama and Bush, too, have been remarkably similar in a \nlot, a lot of ways as Bush was a big spender and President Obama has \ncertainly taken that to new heights.  Also, of course, that is why our \nstock market has done so well, but you can't have Quantitative Easing and \nnot expect, to at some point, have to pay the piper.
