That stuff is an extremely stiff mineral, it can't just \nbecome soft in a few minutes and then harden up a few minutes later. Brush \nafter eating, before the bacteria have time to saturate your mouth with \nlactic acid.\n\nDon't use shower poofies at all (those things people call luffas that \naren't luffas), and don't use luffas, either. Shower poofies are remarkably \nineffective at scrubbing your body. Luffas are decent for scrubbing but you \ncan get the same effect from a cheap rag, and that cleans much easier and \nlasts much longer. Also, the rag is gentler to your skin while still \ngetting the grime off.\n\nAntibacterial soap isn't simply not more effective than regular soap, it is \nactually bad for your health and the health of others around you if you use \nit on a regular basis. Those soaps contain triclosan, a substance that \nlingers on your skin and makes it difficult for bacteria to grow on your \nskin. This negatively affects the bacterial populations on your skin and \ncan lead to bacterial imbalances, infections, or worse, infectious bacteria \nthat resist triclosan--\"superbugs\". Antibacterial soap should only be used \noccasionally when you expect to be making physical contact with a lot of \npeople you don't know, or are working with food to be served to the public. \nIf you do this on a regular basis, don't use antibacterial soap, use latex \nor nitrile gloves.\ufeff",
