Ancient Greek propaganda \nwould have you believe that the Persians were a vast horde of monstrous \nslavers. In reality, the Greeks, particularly the \"freedom loving\" \nSpartans, were some of the most enthusiastic supporters of the slave trade \nof the day. Sparta literally enslaved an entire country; why else do you \nthink they had their entire male population in the army?\n\nPersia had slaves too, true enough. But it wasn't quite so totalitarian as \nthe movie portrays it. To rule such a vast empire, the Great King had to \ndivide it into manageable subdivisions called Satrapies, which were headed \nby regular kings and were administered largely the same as they had been \nbefore being absorbed by Persia. The Ionian Greeks under Persian rule would \nreally not have noticed much of a difference between being independent and \nbeing under Persian \"control.\"\ufeff",

Greeks holding their \nground against a hopeless number of Persians, eventually lose. That's all \nthat's actually important.\nWhat it got wrong was the amount of Greeks. There were only 300 Spartans, \ncorrect, but there was a rough estimate of 7K militia from other \ncity-states (Mainly Athens) with them.\nSpartans didn't fight shirtless, they actually had a very iconic set of \narmor, which was why they did as well as they did, better technology and \nthe strategy to use it.\nI don't exactly know how the Persians figured it out, but they did win \nbecause of the goat path. They flanked around to end it quickly, although \nthey DID have the numbers to just overwhelm the Spartans.\nLeonidas and the 300 pushing into Xerxes' camp never happened, they died \nright there in that canyon. However, the survivors, mainly the Athenians \nand a small handful of Spartans, launched a counterattack and took \nLeonidas' body before he could be beheaded.\nHere's where the movie ended. So you see, everyone complaining about the \nhistorical inaccuracy really needs to calm down, because it wasn't far off \nenough to make such a big deal of it.\ufeff",

The fantastical elements just made \nit even less an attempt at telling history. I'm not going to knock it for \nnot doing something which it was never trying to do anyway.
