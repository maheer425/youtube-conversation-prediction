Pick a \ntighter track and the difference becomes even more. Bikes are much quicker \nin a straight line but lose out on aero, braking and cornering.  On the \nroad though, you are going to get from point A to point B quicker on  a \nbike, because you can't drive a car on the road in the same way you do on \nthe track.",

            "text": "+stealth07r1 P1, 918, LaFerrari, Veyron SS will certainly walk away from a \nliter or hyper bike from 150 mph. The reason is that at high speed, mass is \nnot the primary resistance to acceleration, wind resistance is. When wind \nresistance becomes the primary hindrance, absolute power becomes king \nrather than power:mass. That said, The P1 does the 1/4 in about 9.8 s at \nabout 149 mph, the 918 in about 10.0 s at about 145 mph, the Veyron SS \naround the same (as per MotorTrend/Car&Driver) as the P1 and 918 and \nLaFerrari hasn't been officially tested yet as far as I know, but it will \nbe in the same range. A good run on a stock 2010-ish Honda CBR 1000RR will \ngive a time of about 9.7 s at about 142 mph and a good run on a stock BMW \nS1000RR will give a time of about 9.5 or 9.6 s at about 154 mph (as per \nSportRider Magazine). Yes, the insane tier million-ish dollar hypercars are \ncatching up to the 13-16 thousand dollar liter bikes in terms of 1/4 mile \nacceleration. Beyond that, the car has the bikes beat. Note that a stock \nKawasaki ZX-14R can do a 1/4 a bit faster than the fastest liter bikes.",
