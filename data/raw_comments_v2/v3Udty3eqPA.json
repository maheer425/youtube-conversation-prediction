And I agree that there are better books than \nLegend. But that is just my opinion and yours too. And it's not a rip off \nbecause everyone gets ideas from other work. There is stuffs in Legend that \nare similar in Legend to Divergent and other books. Divergent also has \nsimilar stuffs to Hunger Games and the Giver.But that doesn't make me not \nwant to read Divergent and that doesn't bother me.Legend also has a lot of \ninteresting characters the same way there is in Divergent. It is just a \nmatter of opinion on which is better.Just because Legend isn't as popular \nas Divergent or Hunger Games, that doesn't mean it's a wannabe. Everyone \nstarts from somewhere just like Divergent so id you could please just not \nhate a book series that you have no right to judge because you don't \nactually know what you're talking about, that would be awesome.
