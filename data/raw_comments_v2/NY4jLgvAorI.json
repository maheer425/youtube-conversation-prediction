It is possible that the first episode of \nseason three could be that Chris got stuck in the alternative universe that \nshouldn't exist, The one where Danny does goes back and punts the kids. \nThis is plausible because the emotion lords were talking about how Chris \nhad made his own path to claim Beth and we can assume it was some inter \ndimensional travel at least because the 900(?) year old emotion lord needed \ncatbug (inter dimensional creature) to bring Chris to the parasox pub. \nParasox as in the paradox that Danny created and the external dimension \nthat the pub is in. The effect in the real reality could be that the \nalternative universe that shouldn't exist does become reality, the bad \nstuff happens, but Chris does get Beth. It could be the ultimatum choice \nfor Chris: Beth or the Universe.\n\nOr possibly Danny just gets the sweaters and get a chick so he doesn't need \nBeth, thus Wallow gets Beth.\ufeff",

It is possible that the first episode of \nseason three could be that Chris got stuck in the alternative universe that \nshouldn't exist, The one where Danny does goes back and punts the kids. \nThis is plausible because the emotion lords were talking about how Chris \nhad made his own path to claim Beth and we can assume it was some inter \ndimensional travel at least because the 900(?) year old emotion lord needed \ncatbug (inter dimensional creature) to bring Chris to the parasox pub. \nParasox as in the paradox that Danny created and the external dimension \nthat the pub is in. The effect in the real reality could be that the \nalternative universe that shouldn't exist does become reality, the bad \nstuff happens, but Chris does get Beth. It could be the ultimatum choice \nfor Chris: Beth or the Universe.",
