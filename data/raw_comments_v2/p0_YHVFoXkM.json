It's one of the hardest deaths of anyone famous I've \never had to deal with. I just know I'd be bawling my fucking eyes out. Plus \nyour videos/songs always tend to evoke such strong emotions from me anyhow. \nThey are just so powerful in so many ways, and the musical parts have this \nintense, emotional, evoking, provoking feeling to them. Especially Symphony \nof Science. Half of them make me cry for some reason, they just are that \npowerful. You're really great at this, so don't ever stop. I also think \nSymphony of Science would really be a wonderful method for teaching anyone. \nEspecially young people though, and I personally find myself so much more \ndeeply captivated & interested & wowed than if it was just the regular \nvideos, even though those are already powerful. Then there's this added \nbonus of really loving the songs so much that they not only get stuck in \nyour head, but that you eventually know all the words & remember the \ninformation. I think if there had been a method like this to teach me \nthings, I wouldn't have had such a hard time. )\ufeff",

Yes, that's right, but that doesn't mean that there's no way \nthe Universe can make sense to us. For the most part, the Universe does \nmake sense to us. That's why we can fly to the Mars, manipulate with the \nnuclear forces and create antimatter.\n\n*\"That's simply why many scientists are not atheists\"*\nWell, that's funny because most of the leading scientists *are* atheists:\nhttps://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/sci_relig.htm\n\nYes, Einstein did not believe in a personal god, he believed in the god of \norder and beauty. He was a pantheist and pantheism is sexed-up atheism. \nPlus, einstein's god was killed by Niels Bohr. :)\n\n*\"If we are guided to know the truth by what makes more sense it's no \naccident to end up believing in a God.\"*\nI don't see how this is true. If the existence of something is not \nfalsifiable, then most likely it doesn't exist. If the concept of god was \ncreated by humans, then \"god is real because it's perfect\" is just like \nother unfalsifiable statements, if not, it's the ultimate truth, but we \ncan't know that. Without falsifiability, it's not reasonable to consider \nthe existence of anything. Do you know why science works the way it works? \nBecause our brains have the ability of abstract thinking. Instead of doing \nthe experiments first and then thinking about what could the outcomes mean, \nwe hypothesize and then do the experiment to test it. We drop the \nfalsified hypotheses and theories and work on others and try to falsify \nthem. That's how we get ideas that work well.\n\n*\"[zero-energy universe hypothesis] is incompatible with actual \ncalculations and string theory.\"*\nString theory has been criticized by many great scientists, including \nRichard Feynman.\n\nAnd metaphysically speaking, you could be a sleeping giraffe dreaming about \nbeing a human.",

O My servants, you will not attain harming Me \nso as to harm Me, and you will not attain benefiting Me so as to benefit \nMe. O My servants, if the first of you and the last of you, and the humans \nof you and the jinn of you, were all as pious as the most pious heart of \nany individual amongst you, then this would not increase My Kingdom an \niota. O My servants, if the first of you and the last of you, and the \nhumans of you and the jinn of you, were all as wicked as the most wicked \nheart of any individual amongst you, then this would not decrease My \nKingdom an iota. O My servants, if the first of you and the last of you, \nand the humans of you and the jinn of you, were all to stand together in \none place and ask of Me, and I were to give everyone what he requested, \nthen that would not decrease what I Possess, except what is decreased of \nthe ocean when a needle is dipped into it. O My servants, it is but your \ndeeds that I account for you, and then recompense you for. So he who finds \ngood, let him praise Allah, and he who finds other than that, let him blame \nno one but himself.)",

It's entirely \npossible that someone with the same intent but bigger goals wrote up the \nbible. That doesn't mean such a being doesn't exist.\n\nAlso, using \"he\" is only to familiarize with God. It isn't to humanize him \nor put a label. In our beliefs he is suppose to be our father. The true \nmaker of everything. It was only natural to say \"he\". God is neither \"he\" \nnor \"she\", just a being in its own. \n\nNobody knows for sure how we started or how everything came to be. The only \ntrue way we'd be able to find that out is if we master time itself. I don't \nbelieve that everything was created by mere chance. How intricate and \ncomplex the human brain is, and yet created because of an explosion? I do \nbelieve there is a God out there and we were created for a purpose. I do \nnot claim to know what that purpose is for or if what it says in the bible \nis his true purpose, granted it is quite a strange story. \n\nI think we've gone off track though.

I was born a muslim, \nbecame an an atheist then became a militant atheist then came across \nspiritual satanism to be cool then norse paganism, then as a grown as man i \nrealized that i want to be a good person and in all of history and tales \netc, there's one man who stood out among them and it was jesus. whether or \nnot he was real does no really matter to me but what he did and what he \nwanted people to do matters. im a follower of christ who wants to do good \nand help people.I don't care where you're from who you are etc what matters \nis what you do. if you were a bad person in human standards, we'll take the \nactions with human law, but humanity cannot deem someone to hell or heaven. \nIt's not our place to judge and we sure are not the executioner. anyone who \nsays they follow christ but judge and hate others is not a follower of \nchrist but a messenger of wickedness. when an atheist does something wrong, \ndo we all say that all atheists are bad? You have no right or a place to go \naround telling people that their stories are fairy tales just like how they \nhave no right to tell you that you're wrong. just calm down and relax. be a \nhuman being and don't get angry. being angry is a waste of time",
