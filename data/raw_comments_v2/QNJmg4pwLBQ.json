Also so many of \nthe people lived in shacks with worse quality than the tents we use on a \ncamping trip.\n\nBut what got me the most was that there were so many people smiling \neverywhere we got, because they was fortunate enough to have food enough \nthat day, or even for such things as just being alive, while there are \nloads of people in the first world who gets disappointed over not getting \nthe newest iphone for their birthday or christmas.

It was so heartbreaking because I really couldn't do \nanything right there and then for them, I really had no option other than \nto look away. But unlike John, I actually found that really hard. I wanted \nto sit and talk with them. Or play with the little ones. There was this \nmoment when I took a picture of a little girl, and the look on her face \nwhen I showed it to her broke my heart. She was so excited and it just gave \nme the feels in the most real way. Our guide translated, and told me she'd \nnever seen a picture of herself before.

It falls into that industrial-sized 'not my problem' bowl where \nwe stash stuff like Ebola outbreaks, Japanese earthquakes, and African \ngenocide. It's a nasty vat of soup.\nI guess it's a defense mechanism. I mean, we all can't be Mother Teresa, so \ninstead of filling our heads with other people's problems, we opt for our \nown problems, which are never as big as we make them out to be. Then, if we \nstart to feel guilty that we're insensitive boneheads, we go and adopt some \norphaned kitten we see on the news because it's easier to save a kitten \nthan it is to save the entire Sudan and because kittens are cute, but \nstarvation and/or genocide is not. In fact, it's disturbing and who wants \nto bring that kind of grief into their comfortable living room? So we keep \non saving cats and throwing a few bucks at telethons, and we feel good \nabout ourselves.\nMeanwhile, we ignore that vat of really bad things in the world\u2013a vat that \nain't smelling any sweeter the longer it sits. We can live with it, as long \nas we never dip our ladle into the soup. We can die happy, because, as the \nsay, it's blissful to be an ignoramus.\"\ufeff",
