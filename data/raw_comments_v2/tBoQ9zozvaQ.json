It's sad knowing that Up & Down was released after a 2 year \nbreak and knowing that they only want to to do good enough so they can \nstart preparing for their new album. This just shows that they are serious \nabout their music. Yedang Entertainment should push them to promote an \nalbum, if not consistently singles. I mean, if you want people to remember \nyou, you girls should release single by singe. Look at SISTAR. Not even \nmonths after Touch My Body, they released I Swear. Though the song wasn't \nas commercially successful as the previous, it made people remember them \nmore since they appeared again to promote their single. EXID fighting <3 \ufeff",
