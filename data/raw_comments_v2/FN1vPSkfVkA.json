Now, for the story: WARNING, \nTHIS IS A LOT, BUT MOST OF IT ARE DETAILS AND DESCRIPTIONS TO MAKE THE \nSTORY MORE CLEAR.\nAbtitus literally became an object in the eyes of the brothers and the \nother Assassins (BTW, now the story sounds like FC4, two assholes that you \nhelp and the \"Bad guy\" that is actually good. Lets just add a dance battle \nand hackers and we have \"Ubisoft and the adventure of the brothers\"), a \npowerful object, that can be used for the gods, or for the god, or for a \ngreater but unknow objective, the answer change when you ask a diferent \nfaction. He was locked, and many times he tried to escape, but all hes plan \nended in the same place: Dark magick. He didnt want to use magick, because \nwhile more magick he used, darker hes hearts get. But meanwhile, an emperor \nis planing the attack: The imperial court of the Naraani race AKA aliens \nwas literally a snakep\u00ect. Mostly because the aliens are snake-like \ncreatures, with scales, poison in their sharp fangs and an exceptional \nability for intrigue, as they fancy that they are the only race capable of \nusing the %100 of their minds. \"Or at least thats what they say. But the \neagle always hunts the snake!\" Thought Ken. He was a soldier of Murica sent \nto explore space to find oil, but in his travels he found more, like \nplanets, planets with life, planets with enslaved life, the slavers, or the \nNaraani as they call themselves, and, ehhh, who the hell wrote this script? \nWhathever, he also found White magick... Yes... I ran out of ideas... But \nlets continue: hes ship was destroyed by a giant ship of the naraani, but \nhe surviverd the impact thanks to, well, he says that he survived thanks to \nthe power of patriotism, liberty and capitalism, but he actually survived \nthanks to the scape pods, se now he is hiding in a cave, trying to kill the \nemperor, or as the aliens say, \"The illuminatum maximus\" (YES, ILLUMINATIS \nFROM SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!!!!!!!), but the emperor, called Regenaton \nalways managed to avoid the traps, the rebels, the sabotage, the poison \n(Well, he didnt avoid that, but you know, he is a super snake...), even \nmagick, but this time he was sure that he would kill that sneaky (Or should \ni say... SNAKY! HA! Because he is a snake, and... forget it) bitch, he \nwould contact with great leaders that would help him to onquer that planet \nand the precious oil, \"Surely those great leaders are Washington, Lincoln, \nand all the fathers!\", he thought. \nHe was wrong. \nWhite magick is only white, but nothing change with dark magick.\nImagine trying to see a 4D square, but seeing all of it dimensions and \nviews.\nImagine the mix of a triangle and a circle.\nThats what Ken saw when he invocated the great leaders and descended to \nmadness.\nThat was what Ken saw when he stopped the eternal sleep.\nThats what Ken saw when he did what cults couldnt make in ages.\nThat what Ken saw when he invoked Cthulhu.",

Up until that point, he had been hiding his dark \npowers, as he knew that the second he did, everyone would attempt to use \nthem for the worst. A very intelligent assumption, considering everyone \naround him was an assassin. So, after learning the skills of the assassin, \nhe used his powers to vanish from their grasp, and sent himself far away. \nUnfortunately, he reappeared in quite possibly the most inconvenient place \npossible. He appeared right between the two brothers, right as they were in \nthe middle of their arguments. Instantly, one brother took the obviously \nmagical and dark event as a sign of his right to rule, and a powerful tool \nto help him do so, while the other brother took it as a gift from the dark \ngods to help him carry out their will. Abtitus' worst fears were confirmed. \nHe had only made things worse, and now, unless he did something, he would \nbe sought after for the rest of his life.",
