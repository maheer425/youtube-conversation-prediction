At that moment it hit me that my friend \nhad really passed away, and i began sobbing. Before i new it the whole \ngroup of my other friends and students were also crying. We comforted each \nother in a sensitive moment, and i felt better afterwards. That being said, \nI am not afraid/ashamed and don't feel pressured not to cry infront of \nothers.

Its just healthy to do so because \none will feel like a huge weight is lifted off ones shoulders after one has \n\"cried out\", you will feel more focused and in some cases give you a slight \nfeeling of anger which will drive you to continue \"moving forwards\", so to \nspeak. Just do it in the shower where the sound of running water will mask \nthe crying and you are in private or in confidence with a person that is \ntrustworthy and understanding of both you and the social context of Men \ncrying.\n\nIn the military, being a squad leader, I have had a few soldiers cry on my \nshoulder and it has always turned out better than with the ones that have \nhad it just build up to something worse. Ether towards others or \nthemselves. Both being equally negative in a social context if its \nperceived as the person losing it emotionally as Man. For example, if you \nbeat someone up *(fisty cuffs, not head stomping)* its one thing and might \nbe seen as reasonable in some situations, but if you beat them up in a \ncrying like manner it will have the opposite effect even if you win. \nBecause there is a difference between losing ones temper and losing it \nemotionally, the latter insinuating a lack of control in a feminine way.\n\nCrying in public because of loss of life in any context, your team losing a \nmajor sporting event among fans, watching a sad movie and shedding a tear *(aka, \nnot crying like a bitch)* etc have become more socially acceptable today \nthough. So dont worry about those situations. For most Men its in the \ncontext of work or danger, specially if you are the only male adult around, \nwhere its still \"socially banned\" to cry.\ufeff",
