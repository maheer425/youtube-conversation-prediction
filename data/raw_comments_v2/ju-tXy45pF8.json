When I was in college, I'd be doing \nhomework, even after like only 5 minutes, I'd move onto watching some porn, \nYoutube videos, etc., and it would be like 3-4 hours later, and I'd blame \nmyself. I also suck at absorbing information, instructions and directions. \nI have to take out a piece of paper and write shit which takes time, \nannoying the person giving the information, instructions and directions. I \nalso daydream a lot, even in the middle of a thought. And I talk \nexcessively.\ufeff",
