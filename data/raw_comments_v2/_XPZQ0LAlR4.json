Because France was \nstronger than expected and Great Britain had declared war on Germany, when \nGerman troops marched through Belgium and violated its neutralitly.\n\nSo basically, the Schlieffenplan didn't work out because it was based on \nmisscalculations like GB staying neutral and France being weaker after the \nFranco-Prussian War in 1870/1871. Furthermore, Russia mobilised a lot \nfaster than expected so that Germany had to split her troops and face a \ntwo-front war.\n\nThis was exactly what Bismarck, who had been the first German Reichs \nChancellor, had tried to prevent as he called it the nightmare of \ncoalitions. He had tried to isolate France because he knew they might still \nwant revenge after 1871. Which made sense. Germany had not only defeated \nFrance (in a war that Bismarck had wanted, so he offended the French so \nthat they declared war and Bismarck himself still had a good reputation in \nGermany and people supported him and the war)  but also demanded \nridiculously high reparations and declared the German Reich in the hall of \nmirrors at Versailles,which was basically a slap in the face of the french. \nSo he built his own web of alliances, which was really freakin confusing \nand contradictory, so that his successors didn't really manage to keep it \ngoing and the whole system fell apart, so that eventually Russia and France \nformed and alliance and Germany had only Austria left.\n\nAnd as to the war guilt, Germany might have been blamed in the Treaty of \nVersailles, and you can't deny her influence as she e.g. gave Austria the \n'Carte Blanche' telling them that she'd support them no matter what Austria \ndecided to do, or the new course of Weltpolitik that William the second \nadopted and that created tension in Europe, not forgetting his overall \nproblematic character that ruined Germany's chances of an alliance with GB.\n\nBut I agree with John, that the web of alliances is to blame as it created \ninterdependences and forced different nations to act, although the whole \nthing could've stayed a conflict in the Balcans.\nAlso the whole \"Spirit of 1914\" is to blame. The people wanted a war. They \nthought it would be a great way to show patriotism and strength and the \nsupremacy of a country. Moreover they thought it would be like riding their \nhorse into battle heroically, in their fancy uniforms and be home by \nchristmas as a war hero. Only Industrialisation and new technologies had \nchanged warfare and it was nothing like the wars they had fought before.\n\nSorry if this kinda long but I felt like this whole Germany vs France \nthingy had to be explained a bit more in detail, although I obvsly get that \nyou guys here can't focus on every detail.\n\nAnyway, this is a really good way of revising what I already know cause \nI've got my histoy final in like less than two weeks so yeah....\ufeff",

But the \nreason people use closed captioning (usually) is because for some reason, \nthey can't hear or understand the spoken words. And it's confusing for my \nstudents because they think they missed something. So I have to pause and \nexplain to them that the bracketed words aren't actually said, they're a \njoke that someone added in later. And in this case I also have to explain \nto them what \"booze\" means because they've never heard that word, all while \nthe teacher I'm supposed to be assisting gives me skeptical looks. I think \nit's great that there are captions on the videos. But I would just like for \nthe people who do them to give some thought to the people who will actually \nneed to use the captions and just transcribe the video without \neditorializing.\ufeff",

Serbia was however in Russia's \nsphere of influence.\n@ 1:43 The Germans and Ottomans weren't (secretly) aligned until war had \nalready broke out. And the alliance was of questionable legitimacy given \nthe Sultan would have nothing of it. The Ottomans didn't make their \nsurprise entry into the war until 29th of October.\nAlso, France was in a rock-solid defensive alliance with the Russian empire \nso Germany declaring war against Russia was as good as with France. That's \nwhy Germany were all ready for the Schleiffen plan.\n@ 2:25 Actually the Austro-Hungarian empire were the first power to \nmobilise. And people blame Germany because of their \"blank cheque\" of \nassured assistance of Austria-Hungary and pre-war plans.\n@ 3:32 I can't help feeling you're being a bit rough on the Russian army \nderiding them as \"hapless\". They proved themselves better than the \nAustro-Hungarian army and were no pushover for the Germans (aside from at \nTannenberg). They often got the better of the Germans and against the odds.\n@ 4:50 I'm not so certain that the tactics outside of the trench deadlock \ncould've been much better. The situation of the trench deadlock required \nsome real advancements and refining in artillery bombardment tactics and \nsignals/communications. But out of the trenches in 1914 and again in 1918, \nI can't see how the tactics could've been any better.\n@ 4:55 I could be wrong: but I'm pretty certain that artillery was actually \nthe most deadly form of weapon from the war. And I think that the first \npractical machine gun was invited in France.\n@ 6:05 The entente soldiers may have been rarely hungry but the central \npowers soldiers were usually hungry.\n@ 8:30 At the end of the day: Versailles really had little effect on \nGermany's economy. It has been held as a scapegoat, but Germany's dismal \neconomic performance was for other reasons.\n@ 9:00 It should be mentioned that the October revolution (in November by \nour calendar) and rise of the Bolsheviks was not really all that popular. \nAnd that it was only made possible with sneaky assistance from the German \nforeign ministry.\n\nOtherwise a very good effort.\ufeff",

            "text": "+Daniel Eyre I think this is a good list but there are somethings wrong \nwith it:\n\n\n1. Russia was technically the first to mobilize even though Austro-Hungary \nwas the first to declare war, Austro-Hungary had a policy that whenever \nthey would go to war they would spend a week for all the men to harvest \ntheir crops on the farms and get them to market and then mobilize their \narmy.\n2. The Russian Army was in terrible shape, there was around 1 gun for every \n10 men (according to some estimates) and there was even less equipment for \ntransportation, which at the time was mainly horses, this caused the \nRussian Army to get outflanked by the much better equipped German Army and \ncaused them to lose a lot of battles, armies and land, and in the end the \nRussians lost a majority of their land in the area around Poland. \n3. Also, you just described the Russians as hapless (look it up)\n4. The first practical automatic weapon was the Maxim Gun invented in 1883, \na gun that uses a crank to fire shots in succession is not considered a \nmachine gun, and even if you meant the Mitrailleuse (which is not \nconsidered a machine gun) that was invented in Belgium \n5. I think you forgot the war reparations that were part of the treaty of \nVersailles. 132 billion Gold Marks is a lot in terms of 1919. The war \nreparations caused Germany to print large quantities of money so that they \ncould pay it off and this caused inflation of Papiermark and the \nReichsmark, the inflation was so bad that it was better use the money as \nfuel to burn. Germany had just finished paying the war reparations from \nWorld War 1 in 2010. \n\n6. You forgot to mention that a majority of the civilian causalities of the \nOttoman Empire were due to the Armenian Genocide, Estimates range from \n800,000-1,500,000\n7. Despite the fact that the tank was invented in 1917, the French, Germans \nand British all had armored vehicles that could be used on land, both sides \ndid not implement this technology to its fullest use, when the tank was \ninvented during 1917, the western front became for mobile, there was some \npotential for a more mobile war \n8. The Ottoman-German Alliance was ratified by the Ottomans on August 2, \n1914 and said that they would declare war on Russia 1 day after Germany, \nand they did on August 5, 1914, however they did not start fighting until \nOctober 29th\n9. I wouldn't consider that just because of German money the Bolsheviks \nwon, it helped but the Bolsheviks had a more unified army (as compared to \nthe White Russians), better propaganda, and were well lead, also the White \nRussians had significantly more outside support from countries outside \ncountries like Britain and America.\n10. People blamed Germany for World War 1 because of the blank cheque, \ndeclaring war on Russia, all of the major powers fought them, and the fact \nthat the major powers at the treaty of Versailles were all provoked to war \nby Germany and not the other way around (Zimmerman Telegram, Invasion of \nBelgium, declaring war on France). I personally blame Austria. \n\nOtherwise good list",
