It is better if you \npartially mix the butter and the cinnamon sugar mix, so that the majority \nof the sugar and the cinnamon are not mixed. After the toast is finished, \nimmediately get to work on spreading the butter, and then sprinkle the \ncinnamon sugar method on it. The crunchiness of the toast, accompanied by \nthe sugar and cinnamon mix will create the crust. Since the toast was still \nwarm as you spread the butter, the butter will create the sogginess \nrequired. Results may vary.\ufeff",

(Though I actually prefer brown sugar and \nvanilla.)\n\n(Please note that my awesome technique allows one to use liquidus \nflavorings if such is desired)\n\n(Is liquidus actually a word?)\n\n(If so, did I spell it right?)\n\nOh yes, the next step is to nuke the receptacle and its contents for a few \nseconds.\n\nPlease note that it's extremely easy to overnuke.\n\n(Another non-word.  Somebody needs to talk to Webster.)\n\nAnyhow, the idea is to soften the butter, not liquefy it.\n\nSpread the resultant buttery sugary goodness upon your bread and toast it.\ufeff",
