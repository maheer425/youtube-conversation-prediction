Power is \nthe ratio of energy to time, and when the gears are connected to each \nother, they transfer the same amount of energy to each other over time. The \npower that one gear has will be the same as any other in the chain.\n\nSince energy cannot be created or destroyed, changing one of the factors of \nthat energy will not affect the overall energy being put out over time. At \nany given point in time, the energy that the first gear spends is the same \nas that of the last in the chain. This means that when one factor is \nlacking, the other factor will simply compensate. This is a very simple way \nof saying that if we found a way to connect the gears and add one that *slows \none of the gears down* so that the overall *distance* that the gear sweeps \nout over time is reduced, it will produce a greater *force,* since energy \nis just the product of energy and force.",

            "text": "+npataya There are tons of formulas related to this, since there are tons \nof concepts involved: forces, energy, velocity, radial velocity, radius, \ntorque. You can see for example here: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear_train, though it's not easy reading.\n\nThe video tries to avoid many of the complexities, and focus on one \nproperty, and one formula:\nIf a gear's tooth is travelling distance X1 and exerting force F1, then it \ngenerates energy E=F1 X1. \nIf the car (or weight, or whatever is moving in the end), is moving a \ndifferent distance X2, then it experiences a different force F2. Because of \nenergy conservation we know that F2 X2 = F1 X1,\nOr F2 = F1 X1 / X2.\n\nSo if you add some gears that cause a distance of X1 in the engine source \ngear to be translated to smaller distance in the final car wheels, say \nX2=X1/2, then the original force F1 is doubled.",

When \nthe first gear  (the one attached to the engine) tooth moves one \ncentimeter, it pushes the next gear's tooth by one centimeter, which pushes \nthe next gear's tooth by one centimeter, which eventually should lift the \nweight by one centimeter. So it's just the same as connecting the first \ngear directly.\n\nYou can see at 1:47, where the distance each tooth covers is tracked by a \nvisual aid, that they're all covering the same distance. \n\nAt 2:00 there's a different arrangement, where for each centimeter the \nfirst gear's tooth is moving, the last gear's tooth is moving only 1/2 a \ncentimeter. This allows the same amount of energy to produce a double \namount of force.",
