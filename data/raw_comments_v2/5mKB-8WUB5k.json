In particular, the proportions of \nthe cars, the headlights, the exhaust placement, and the 3/4 rear view are \nradically different. Personally, although I like the look of both cars, I \nwouldn't get either at their respective price classes (although I could \ncertainly understand, in both cases, why someone would). Further - and this \nis especially true if you see it in person - the McLaren has a shock factor \nthat is unmatched by the Corvette. One doesn't see a Corvette from 200 feet \naway and think \"whoa! What is THAT thing?\" The McLaren does cause this kind \nof reaction - and in the league it plays, it should. It is also fine that \nthe Corvette, while certainly good looking, does not inspire that kind of \nreaction. One could argue (I won't) that the McLaren is too expensive for \nwhat it is. Regardless of your apparent perspective that the two cars look \nthe same - rest assured - it's pretty clear on sight alone that the McLaren \nis a much more expensive car, and that it should be.\ufeff",
