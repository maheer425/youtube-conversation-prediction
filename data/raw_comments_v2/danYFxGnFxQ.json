Did he find \nthe complex nature of quantum physics like Bohr, Heisenberg, Einstein, \nRutherford, Planck, Michelson, and Young? Did he advance the field of \nelectromagnetism like Maxwell? \nDon't get me wrong, Tesla was certainly a genius in electrical engineering \n(X-rays in particular) and definitely deserves the credit that he is \nreceiving these days. But just because you're Serbian doesn't mean that \nTesla should be considered a \"real hero\". You simple-minded nationalist \nneed to get your head out of your ass and discover that there are many more \nbrilliant physicists than just Tesla.

It actually built itself on \nclassical liberalism in many respects.  Marx even praised the American \nJacksonians as paving the way for a victory of working people that would \nnot require revolution.  (A bit naively when you consider the racial record \nof the Jacksonians, but I digress.)  \n\nWhere Marx loses me is when he becomes a kind of Atheist Creationist, \nbelieving in absurdities like the State that Withers Away.  I am skeptical \nof that idea since I have never seen a State, even a genuine Worker's \nState, ever wither away.  At least left anarchists are realists in that \nthey understand that the abolition of the state and the abolition of \ncapitalism would have to occur together in one swoop, not one after the \nother.  But, as I said before, I respect Marx as a thinker superior to \nother Philosophical Materialists who then as now frame(d) their views on \nthe unstated premises of Victorian Capitalism (Dawkins, Galton, Bertrand \nRussell, et al)\n\nStalin became a Fascist in all but name so the whole \"communism\" ideal \nchanged.  Besides, if you are so interested in communism you should know \nthat Marx was the biggest enemy of the whole \"Sir\" idea and title of \nnobility. So why the whole \"Sir\" Isaac Newton business?",
