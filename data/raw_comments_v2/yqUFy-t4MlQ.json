Do yourself a favour and google Jenner \nand see if he was the 'saviour of the world' this video cranks him up to \nbe. Then look up some current stats on vaccine damage. Then find out that \nsmallpox was already practically eradicated when mass vaccine programmes \nstarted to be introduced. Then discover that the programmes were abandoned \nwhen widespread vaccine damage cases kept being reported. WHO declared the \nvaccination programme a triumph of modern medicine, but actually there was \nstill plenty of smallpox about, so they changed the name to 'monkeypox' and \nbingo - smallpox has been eradicated!

However, a decision \nwhich involves riskiness is only glorified after the good outcome is \nachieved. Due to a principle of uncertainty regarding this matter (not to \nbe confused with that of quantum mechanics), risky decisions may actually \nresult in undesired consequences. People evoke sympathy for the suffering \nof others, so when a decision which leads to the debilitation or mortality \nof others, people may commonly reject all of what that decision maker \nstands for. A good example of this would be president Carter's decision in \n1980 to attempt to rescue hostages during the Iran Hostage Crisis. As many \npeople know, the mission was a complete failure because not only were any \nhostages rescued, but also eight American service men were killed. Carter \nlater lost the reelection. In the event of small pox, not only might Jenner \nhave killed a young boy but also may have spread the disease even more than \nit already has, potentially causing a chain reaction of human deaths. Even \nthough the disease has been almost been completely thrust out of existence \nbecause of his efforts, his risking of human lives must not be glorified \nbut rather we should simply be relieved that he had not killed anyone \nindirectly. I am also not just attacking Edward Jenner. I want all of you \nwho read this comment to consider the value of every person's life when you \nhear about an option with results as insecure as such. Yes, there exist \nsome circumstances where the rejection of this kind of sacrifice may lead \nto more overall suffering than in the event of utilized sacrifice.

            "text": "+prei tek [Not trying to make a fool out you, just giving the technical \nfacts to an otherwise inquisitive person] Ingestion is far less effective \nthan vaccination due to the fact that, during digestion, your body is \ntrying to break down whatever is put into it (especially things like \nproteins {the likely drug in question} ab intra the stomach). This is \ndoubly so in the case of HIV (a virus, or complex protein, not a bacterium) \nas it affects the immune system; the drug would have to get to the small \nintestine (again, it still has to get through the destructive stomach \nfirst) before it's even close the lymphatic system, let alone the \ncirculatory system. If you're instead referring to a pill, you'd have to be \nusing a relatively simple (relative to a protein, that is) chemical to keep \nfrom losing effectiveness in a solid, pill form. This works when we're \ndealing with combating microorganisms (like bacteria) because said chemical \nwould only have to affect one of many necessary functions (such as the \nbreakdown of nutrients, the separation of the cell, etc.) wherein a virus, \nbeing nothing but a complex chemical, requires none of that for its one \naction: \"reproduction\" (it's in this way that our complexity becomes our \ndownfall). Proteins can really only be taken down in one way: denaturation, \nor the alteration of one (or more) of their structure levels (how the \nprotein is shaped and ultimately, how it acts {remember the mantra, \"form \nfits function\"}). There are, however, chemicals capable of carrying out \ndenaturation, though these chemicals (examples of which include sulfuric \nacid) have a way of denaturing any protein they come in contact with \n(including the one that you need to survive). This is than amplified by the \nfact that pills are \"dumb\"; there is not way of effectively controlling \nwhat they interact with. The solution comes back to proteins which can be \ndesigned to attack certain chemical bonds (such as those in a virus). These \nproteins are, of course, called antibodies and produced by the immune \nsystem. With HIV (along with any virus that leads to immunodeficiency), \nhowever, your immune system becomes too damaged before you're able to \ndevelop an antibody to fit HIV's ever-changing form. This, of course, is \nwhat makes HIV so complicating and hard to fight and why the cure will \nlikely have to be man made. My  point in all of this is: the cure for HIV \nwould have to be in the form of a protein-based injection (hopefully, you \ngleamed some other facts from this as well). Cheers!",
