So the girl made it awkward, and the dude is a jerk.\n4. Being the only person not to laugh in a group makes you look awkward, \nthis doesn't just apply to girls...\n5. I think that dude is a moron....\n6. Has anyone ever told you, that sometimes your friend is going to spill a \nton of shit to you, don't ever give advice until he/she asks for some. \nEventually they figure it out on their own.\n7. M-a-n-n-e-r-s, i don't like em but even i am not that bad. Its like \nsaying out loud \"yo ima go take a shit brb.\"\n8. Awkward, also how did that guy forget where she parked.\ufeff",
