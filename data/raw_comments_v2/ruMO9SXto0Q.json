It just seems like this plot hole could have easily been \naddressed if the writers just had Chris Evans say something like the plain \nwas losing fuel or the controls were damaged and the auto pilot was on some \nkind of deadman's switch so he couldn't jump out of the plain and live like \nhe did in the winter soldier or the plane would go right back on autopilot. \nIt wouldn't make much sense but it would be better than the plot hole that \nthey gave us.\ufeff",
