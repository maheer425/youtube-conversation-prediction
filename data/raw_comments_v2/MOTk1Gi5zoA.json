Which is why the franchise gets more and more ridiculous and \nloses creditablity. It is slowly getting sillier and losing its charm and \nhumor. It's not as bad as Transformers but at the rate things are going it \ncould get there.\n2-Fast and Furious has been around since 2001 and had a small fan base \nuntil only recently when Fast Five in 2011 catapulted it into a Summer \nblockbuster.\n3-You don't have to like F&F but it deserves a better comparison than \nTransformers. Everybody compares every romance movie they don't like to \nTwilight and everybody compares every action movie they don't like to \nTransformers. There is no comparison. Comparing F&F at its very worst to \nTransformers is like comparing Pearl Harbor to the Holocaust. Even the \nExpendables is better than Transformers. The biggest difference between F&F \nand Transformers is effort and creativity. F&F has well choreographed fight \nscenes, elaborate, clever, and well thought up action scenes. F&F only \nproblem is it ignores the laws of physics and its characters can survive \nany catastrophic accident. Transformers is a bunch of robots incoherently \nshooting and hitting each other in slow motion. The action and dialogue is \ncliche. There is not an ounce of original thought or creativity put into \nTransformers. The jokes are disgusting, offensive, juvenile, and...weird. \nTransformers is painful to watch. Particularly the 2nd one (never watched \nthe 4th one). It didn't even look like Michael Bay was trying to earn his \ncheck. Even the most outlandish F&F scene required some crazy, outside the \nbox directing. Any 9yr old boy could do Michael Bay's job.",
