The ELITETheir ability to ascend to the elite rich of \ntodays world, indicates they ran the show all those years ago.The pride of \nEgypt belongs to the Jews.They were however greedy and exiled by those they \nruled over during an uprising.they fled to Israel and beyond and wrote into \ntheir bible that THEY were the slaves.Which is ridiculous!

The biggest problem that we have to get over is \"white denial,\" \nthough, and I say that as someone who has studied that for a long time. \n\nEven in the early 60s, BEFORE the Civil Rights Act was passed, Gallup Polls \nfound that 2 out of 3 white Americans thought that black Americans had \nFULLY equal opportunity. \n\nAs an African man I'm saying, if you don't TALK to children ABOUT \nRACISM(White Supremacy or African Supremacy), both PAST AND PRESENT, they \ngrow up \u2014 they can look around and see the disparities \u2014 they can see that \nwho has what is often about color, who lives where is often about color \u2014 \nif you don't provide the context for that, you know what happens, those \nkids grow up, according to the research, to believe that those disparities \nare A) natural, which is a dangerous thought, or B) that the folks on the \nbottom are there because...they don't try hard enough, their bad people, \nthey aren't as smart as the rest of us whites.\n\nCarthage was founded in the 9th century B.C. on the Gulf of Tunis. From the \n6th century onwards, it developed into a great trading empire covering much \nof the Mediterranean and was home to a brilliant civilization. In the \ncourse of the long Punic Wars, Carthage occupied some of Rome\u2019s territories \nbefore finally being destroyed by its rival in 146 B.C.\nIn his book, World\u2019s Great Men of Color, Volume 1, history scholar J.A. \nRogers asserts, \u201cThe Carthaginians were descendants of the Phoenicians, a \nNegroid people, and that in fact until the rise of the doctrine of white \nsuperiority, Hannibal was traditionally known as a Black man.\u201d\nToday, many encyclopedias classify the Carthaginians as whites or Semites, \nbut ancient Greek and Roman eyewitness accounts paint a different \npicture.The indigenous peoples of Carthage were called the Afers.  Ancient \nRoman poet Vergil in his poem \u201cMoretum\u201d speaks of a woman from the Afer \n[Afar/Afra] race. He says of her:\n\u201cAnd all her figure proves her native land. Her hair was curly, thick her \nlips, and dark her color.\u201d\nIn Library of  History Book XX, Greek historian Diodorus mentions a Greek \nlieutenant named Agathocles, who defeated a people in the area of \npresent-day Tunisia, who were the same hue as Ethiopians.\nThe eyewitness accounts are corroborated by physical anthropology. L. \nBertholon and E. Chantre, both well-noted French anthropologists, \ndocumented their examination of skeletons throughout North Africa in all \nperiods. They note that the remains of both upper and lower class \nindividuals of ancient North Africa were representative of the Negroid race.\n\ncommon white defense mechanism when faced with racial issues *\n -bring up how slavery is over\n -bring up how none of their ancestors owned slaves\n -point fingers at other races\n-creates some fabricated oppression towards whites\n-go on a reverse racism rant\n- Throwing out random FBI statistics of black crime\n -Makes statements with no factual basis to their statement like \"black \npeople want free handouts\", when in reality hard work and laziness is not \nexclusive to a particular race or gender.\nQUOTE \"All the Egyptians,\" wrote de Volney, \"have a bloated face, puffed-up \neyes, flat nose, thick lips \u2013 in a word, the true face of the mulatto. I \nwas tempted to attribute it to the climate, but when I visited the Sphinx, \nits appearance gave me the key to the riddle. On seeing that head, \ntypically Negro in all its features,remarkable passage where Herodotus \nsays: ' As for me, I judge the Colchians to be a colony of the Egyptians \nbecause, like them, they are black with woolly hair... \"When I visited the \nSphinx, I could not help thinking that the figure of that monster furnished \nthe true solution to the enigma(of how the modern Egyptians came to have \ntheir 'mulatto' appearance) \"In other words, the ancient Egyptians were \ntrue Negroes of the same type as all native-born Africans. That being so, \nwe can see how their blood, mixed for several centuries with that of the \nGreeks and Romans, must have lost the intensity of its original color, \nwhile retaining nonetheless the imprint of its original mold. \"Just think,\" \nde Volne declared incredulously, \"that this race of Black men, today our \nslave and the object of our scorn, is the very race to which we owe our \narts, sciences, and even the use of speech! Just imagine, finally, that it \nis in the midst of people who call themselves the greatest friends of \nliberty and humanity that one has approved the most barbarous slavery, and \nquestioned whether Black men have the same kind of intelligence as whites!\" \nEND QUOTE\n\nwhat egyptology does:\n1. \"Ignore or refuse to publish any facts of african history\" that would \nnot support their racial theories.\n2. \"Create a religious and 'scientific' doctrine\" to ease the white \nconscience for oppressing and enslaving african people.\n3.\"Flood the world with hastily thrown together african \"historians\" \" that \ncontain european perspectives only.\n4.start renaming people and places. \"Replace African names of persons, \nplaces, and things with Arabic and european names.\" this will disguise \nblack identity.\n5. Change the criteria for defining race. for example, one drop of negro \nblood in america makes you a negro, no matter how light your skin. when \nreporting ancient history, reverse the standard. Make one drop of white \nblood render someone a caucasion no matter how dark the skin.\n6.when black participation in civilization is so obvious your best schemes \ncan't hide it, find a way to attribute the success to outside white \ninfluence.\n7. When all the ancient historians contradict your theory, seek to \ndiscredit them.\n\nHerodotus says: ' As for me, I judge the Colchians to be a colony of the \nEgyptians because, like them, they are black with woolly hair.",
