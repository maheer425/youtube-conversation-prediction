This is how it works: you make a choice of how many cards \nyou'll be facing up in the beginning when these are behind your back take \nthe same number of cards of the top as you chose to have face up. If you \nhave chosen for m cards up, then you take m cards if you pull n amount of \ncards facing up then the amount of cards facing down in the pulling hand is \nm-n this is also the amount of face up cards left in the deck because u \nstarted with m and subtracted n cards. by turning over those pulled cards \nthe face up cards go face down and vice versa, making the m-n that were \nface down go face up this gives you 2 hands of m-n face up cards. The cards \nfacing down will vary though, but you can do the same bet starting the same \nway(with set amount of cards facing up), but saying to have the same amount \nfacing down, the only difference is to switch which hand flips the cards.\n( m&n are 2 variables with: m=cards you chose to face up at the start \n&n=cards pulled face up behind your back)\ufeff",

I think it's really unfair for you to make such comments on \nthis video without actually thinking about the problem.\nThis trick is basically a simple mathematical problem, and i can prove it \nworks every time.\n\nLet's say there's NO face-up cards in the 5 cards you take out. That means \nthere are 5 face-up cards in the OTHER deck. So when you turn the 5 \nface-down cards, each deck will have 5 face-up cards. <-- Same number of \nface-up cards.  \n\nThis can be applied for all other situations (e.g 1 faceup --> 4 faceup). \n\nSo next time, please think about the problem before you comment.\nHave a nice day. :3",
