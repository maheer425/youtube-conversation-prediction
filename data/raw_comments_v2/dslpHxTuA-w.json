To me, this is more about the problem of \nracism/slavery/freedom than anything made now, because, back then, the \nproblem was not a legendary thing heard by coincidence in school, these \nartists had a real struggle to go along with, they had to fight to prove \nthemselves against a white system. She's singing to God with such an \nintensity.  She makes me believe. So, mr. Quincey Jones went there, wrote \nsome music for Diana, met a young Michael. It's not only about music, it'a \nabout a world changing. Only respect for those legendary artists and human \nbeings. \ufeff",

But THE WIZ also got many great praise by critics also.\nREAD EM AND WEEP TWATBRAIN4EVER. Your so jealous of Diana Ross its pathetic\n- Fabulous is the word for The Wiz...A colossal entertainment. Everyone is \njust plain perfect. - Rex Reed\n\n- Great fun, color, style & flair. It works delightfully. You want to jump \nup & dance along. - Jay Carr, Detroit News\n\n- Ross is superb in The Wiz; her performance ranks with that of Streisand \nin Funny Girl & Minnelli in Cabaret. - Gene Siskel, Chicago Tribune\n\n- Diana Ross is a Whiz in The Wiz. - Scott Cain, Atlanta Journal\n\n- Ted Ross as the lion is simply wonderful in his exuberance & confidence \nas he searches for courage. Mabel King is another knockout standout as the \nwicked witch. Michael Jackson shows charm & compassion as Scarecrow & \nNipsey Russell is a pleasant surprise as the tin man. - Rona Barrett, ABC TV\n\nThe Big New Hit In Town! 4th Week in its Exclusive San Francisco Run! - SF \nChronicle\n\n- It's slick & energetic & fun. Great moments & a lot of life, sensational \nspecial effects & costumes. - Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun Times\n\n- Even if you've watched The Wizard of Oz every one of the 18 times it's \nbeen on tv, chances are you've never seen anything like The Wiz. - Susan \nSlobojan, Detroit News\n\nHallelujah! It's celestial take-off time at the movies again. Within the \nframework of a musical fantasy, Lumet's spectacular, joyous production of \nThe Wiz generates a mood of wonder & sentimental rapture recalling the \narrival of the Mother Ship in Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind. A sublimely \nhappy movie-going experience. The Wiz is a marvel & it should be an \nenduring source of pleasure to several generations of movie-going kids, \nfamilies & fantastists. You come out of this movie feeling blissfully moved \n& glad to be alive. -Gary Arnold, Washington Post\n\n- I loved The Wiz! I think the movie version is just wonderful. Lumet \ncreates absolute magic. I wanted to cheer. The Wiz makes you feel good. - \nWalter Spencer, WOR Radio\n\n- The Wiz is among the most visually exciting film musicals ever made...It \nis enchanting when you are ogling it, laughing at the gags, listening to \nthe songs or tapping to the rhythm. Oz is now New York & the effects are \nfabulous. - William Wolf, Cue magazine\n***Mary Wilson*** is STILL a LOSER hahahahahahahahaha",
