Islam \nteaches that Jesus was one of the greatest prophets to ever live and that \nhe should be respected and honoured. Islam is all about prophetic respect \nand fully acknowledges, accepts and rejoices the work Jesus did (blessings \nbe upon him). It is just a matter of uneducation and stereotypes.\ufeff",

That \nshould be obvious. Just because he SAYS there is no bias, doesn't mean we \nneed to swallow his words. Just because he has PHD in his name, doesn't \nmean we need to put aside the fact that his deepest belief and values in \nthis world  align to JUST ONE of the religions in the scope of religions he \nwrites about. He should write about something that doesn't conflict with \nhis FAITH - which as we all know can make people have the strongest agenda \nof any agendas.

Reza is as qualified as any other expert and historian to talk \nabout this topic and write a book about it and every other scholar has the \nright to agree or disagree with it, but the only thing she was trying to do \nwas blatantly trying to make him look unqualified to write a book about \n\"religion\" which is his \"field\" of study, that's what he does, studying \nreligion.",
