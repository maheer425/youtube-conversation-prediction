If we really let nature take its own course, then many \nhumans (and animals) would have already been dead. Do you ever get \nvaccinated or visit the doctor? Are you using your computer now or do you \nown a cell phone? Medical intervention and technology also defies Mother \nNature.

Although it's not a matter of any of us \nbeing right or not, it's a matter of doing what's right for the animals. \nmany will fire back stating that they are doing the right things for the \nanimals. Are we? Really? Many state there are animals in captivity in order \nto save endangered species with that being said we are doing the right \nthing would be their claim. In reality nature has this thing called natural \nselection therefore we have no right to involve ourselves in that process. \nFurther more should any human want to do the \"right thing\" to save a \nendangered species then the right formula to that problem would be to stop \nhunting these animals for game and stop taking their habitat away from \nthem. People take in in predators right? Such as let's say a Lioness. They \ncage her and feed her and think it's all good. Good for who is the \nquestion. Good for their own self fulfillment? Or good for their \npocketbook? Certainly it's not good for the animal. The animal didn't sign \nup for this. A predator not only wants to be free like every other living \nspecies including us. Predators want to hunt, they don't want to be fed. \nSome things are so perfect nothing has the right to attempt to alter that. \nMother nature is one of those things that's just that perfect that again we \nhave ZERO right to mess with.
