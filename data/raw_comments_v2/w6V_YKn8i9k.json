To focus on *one* \nissue: Hegel's 'end of history', and entire philosophical system - is \nretroactive: that's what the famous 'Owl of Minerva' in the preface of the \nPhil of Right means. There is no god-given goal which history follows, just \na recollection to our own perspective. \nIt's the similar to the fact that the universe was \"destined\" to create \nmankind: we exist... so the universe must be able to have humans in it. \nIt's a logical deduction.\n It is entirely possible an asteroid or something could put a contingent \nend to us. He does not believe, nor does his system imply, any inescapable \nfates or destinies in the future, or that no more real change will occur \nafter him. History (or real) is 'rational' only in this retroactive \nway. What has been called the 'end of history' is simply Hegel applying \nthis logic to history to place his own philosophical contributions in a \nhistorical context. That's all. He makes this absolutely clear in the \npreface of the Philosophy of Right.\ufeff",

Ugh, this is a good example of one of the problems I \nhave with most kinds of philosophy.  \"History\" is not a separate entity \nwith it's own consciousness.\n\n...and even if it's just a flowery metaphor for saying that the style of \nhistorical record keeping is representative of the people who were capable \nof keeping that record; that kind of inaccuracy is the reason why \"dualism\" \nis a thing that people still believe.\n\nAnd I don't really care about what he was arguing.  At it's base, all he's \narguing is that, without something to struggle against, we will stop \nprogressing.  Of course, even if we aren't progressing, \"history\" won't end \nuntil people stop recording what happens.\n\nBut the point still stands that he tried to define history and that the \ndefinition he gave was just an inaccurate description meant only to support \nan argument that wouldn't be realistic without the self-serving definition.\n\nI ask myself: \"Why didn't he just *say* that progression will cease and \ncivilization will stagnate if we remove all obstacles to overcome?  Why did \nhe use confusing terminology that requires unproven assumptions about \npurpose and direction?\"  And all I can think is that he was inserting those \nassumptions as legitimate facts about reality into a hypothetical situation \nwhen it wasn't required... which suggest a bit of dishonesty.\n\nAt the very least... it was a hypothetical situation with too many \"if\"s.  *Fictional \nstories* present those better... not philosophies that shape belief..",

You may \nthink that this mentality has come to be as a result of a capitalist \nsociety, but you are simply just dismissing reality.

It shows you a visual representation \nof how close to finishing a task you or your computer/phone/whatever is. As \nfurther progress is made, the bar changes. Namely, it gets bigger. But what \nhappens when it reached 100%? It means the task is done. After this, what \ndo you do with the progress bar? If you're installing a program onto your \nPC, obviously you will want to close the bar and start actually using your \nprogram, right? If you were working towards an achievement in one of your \ngames, you keep it around to look at later. You wouldn't say the progress \nbar itself actually does anything after this point, would you? Even if it \nis still there in some sense?\n\nHegel is trying answer the question of what \"History\" actually is, and his \nanswer, the \"dialectic\", could be thought of as a progress bar. When it's \nin progress, it is immensely useful to observe and gauge how close you are \nto the goal. When it's full, there obviously isn't any progress left to \nmake OR record, right? No event in a perfectly free society would ever \nwarrant committing to history, because no event in a perfectly free society \nwould ever change anything about it!\n\nIf you try to think really hard about this idea and get really confused by \nit, that's good. It means your brain is functioning! Perfection is an \nextremely hard concept to pin down and explain in a way that makes rational \nsense. I hope I've helped clarify Hegel's idea a little bit. However, it's \nperfectly possible I have it way wrong! I haven't yet read through a \ncomplete work of Hegel's (continental philosophers scare me!), but I've \ntried to read up at least a little bit on Hegel's dialectic. \n\nCheers.",
