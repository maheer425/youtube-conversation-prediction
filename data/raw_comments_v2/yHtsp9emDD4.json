I was in the canyons today, with full leathers, \nrunning it is Sport Mode, between 2-3 gears, and felt absolutely no heat \nproblem! When you do feel heat, it mostly comes when the bike is in low \nrpm's, for example, 2nd gear at 4 rpm's while you're behind a slower car \n(the engine becomes inpatient like this). As long as you ride normally, you \nfeel warm in jeans (but not bad), but in leathers, not much heat at all! \nHope this helps: 2014 Panigale S, Black/Stealth Edition!",
