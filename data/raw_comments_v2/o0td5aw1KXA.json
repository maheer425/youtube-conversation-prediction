If I read anything, it would not stay put..I could not \nhold on to any new information or retrieve old info. I read everthing I \ncould ( over and over ) about how stress affects the brain. The amygdala \n(alarm system in the brain) is on full alert and your neocortex shuts down \nand along with it, all your higher order cognitive skills. Your hippocampus \n(where some memories are processed) shrinks and your memory is seriously \naffected. I began to practise mindfulness and eventually I was able to \nalter my stress response. It was a fairly long process but now my memory is \nsharp and I can retain and use new information. I am no longer depressed \nand I changed by befriending my brain and learning to turn off the stress \nresponse! A very simple basic life changing exercise.. breathe in through \nyour nose and out through your mouth. Breathe slower on the exhale. This \ndeactivates the stress response. Once out of stress mode, your body and \nbrain can begin to heal. Do it as many times as u can throughout the day \n..set little reminders. Just a couple of these breaths regularly. The \nhippocampus can regrow neurons. You can get your short term memory back!! \nGood luck.",
