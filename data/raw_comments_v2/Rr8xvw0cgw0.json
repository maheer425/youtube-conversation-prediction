I could not use my hands to write anything. I could not \nspeak very well. I was a total mess. \n\nI went home and turned my music up loud, then proceeded to have a temper \ntantrum,. I yelled at God and asked him why I could never be happy. I \ncomplained that I had never found happiness for longer than a year at a \ntime, then all was misery. By the time my tantrum was over I was exhausted \nand fell into a sleep. \n\nNow, 14 years later, and many blessing from my beloved brethren later I can \nsee that was only the beginning of my healing.I have bounced between \nillness and health. Between understanding and confusion. True, I still have \na speech problem, and I am still having to use a wheel chair. However, I am \nhappy to know that Father is pleased with what I am doing. He has joy when \nI repent and be myself. I know that God lives. I know that He loves me, and \nI also know that He loves you. \n\nJesus is the Christ. He died that we can live. He set the perfect example \nof obedience and did it for you and me. I know that all will be well, no \nmatter what happens because God is just. It took me a long time to \nunderstand that. But it is truth. I am so grateful for truth. \n\nI hope you will watch that video. \ufeff",
