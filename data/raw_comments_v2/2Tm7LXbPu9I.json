I feel that if people \nwere more understanding and communicated their feelings with each other \nmore, there would be less fights. Too many people want to be the right one \nin the relationship, but part of being in a relationship is compromising \nand being understanding. In all honesty we usually bicker over what to eat. \nThat's it...he's picky and I'm the fat ass hahahhaha\ufeff",

I have been married for almost 9 years (this \njuly) and my husband and I love each other very much, but we fight BAD. We \nfight SOOOO hard! I think it's because we are both very VERY stubborn, we \nboth always have to be right and we both always have to have the last word. \nWe also are both short tempered. We are so much alike that it's scary, and \nthat why we get along so well but also why we don't get along so well, if \nthat makes sense lol. Sometimes I joke that we must be Italian or something \nbecause we are very hot-headed and very passionate (I hope that's not \nracist, i'm not meaning it to be racist, I apologize if that offends \nanyone). We fight hard but we also love hard, too. Our relationship reminds \nme of that Haagen Dazs Gelato commercial where the couple is speaking \nItalian lol. Both of us are too prideful to admit when we're wrong and it's \nsomething that we're working on. I don't mind disagreeing but the yelling \ngets old and it is taking a toll on our relationship. Also, when we get \nreally angry we say hurtful things that we later apologize for and say we \ndidn't mean, but it still hurts. We are working on our anger and trying to \ndisagree like rational adults instead of being so quick to anger and going \nfrom simple disagreeing to rage in like, 3 seconds.\ufeff",
