It's a made up title modern \nhistorians throw around. The historical title might have changed a bit over \nthe time but it always meant the same thing.\n\n\u201eI think the most important aspect anyway is to look at what was meant by \nCharlemagne having the title in 800 and Otto getting it ca. 988 after \nLechfeld. \u201e\n\nWhat was 988? Lechfeld was 955, his imperial coronation 962. I would say \nthose two events are pretty much disconnected.\nOtto got his imperial crown because he managed to attain the royal crown of \nItaly by overthrowing the old king Berengar and because he was the most \npowerful man of his time with whom the pope would want to arrange a deal so \nthat he wouldn't be threatened by Italian nobles anymore.\nBasically the same thing as Charlemagne.\n\n\u201eOtto was the first guy to TRULY shape the boundaries and culture of \nGERMANY, which was little more than an idea and dream at the time.\u201c\n\nWell, I would say his father Henry consolidated the East Frankish/German \nkingdom before him. Otto had to do it again and was more aggressive about \nit. His \u201eReichskirchensystem\u201c (imperial church system) and the victory at \nthe Lechfeld established the German monarchy as a more stable institution \nfor the time being.\n\nYeah, I would definitely see Otto's reign as a milestone in German history \nbut the question was if him being the \u201eHoly Roman Emperor\u201c was anything \ndifferent than what Charlemagne established.\nI don't know how you can argue that.\n\n\u201eThe Carolingians were, and saw themselves more as, a universal empire. \u201e\n\nSo did the Ottonians and some of the Salians. Frederick Barbarossa was all \nabout being the universal emperor thus being so harsh about the lombard \ncities that dared to self-govern. I would argue that first during and after \nthe interregnum the HRE would shrink more to its German nucleus.\n\n\u201eI also see your points about the connection through the word \"Roman\". \n However, I think you may be weighing it a bit too much.\n\nI don't think I am because of the Biblical prophecies and the reputation \nthe emperors held by that title. Afterall, gaining the blessing by the pope \nwas hard work every time.\nThe kings wouldn't have cherished it so much if it didn't hold as much \nmeaning for them.\n\n\u201e Europe had changed by 988.  Charlemagne was a distant memory and his \nempire long fallen to pieces.\u201c\n\nWell, yeah. Factually speaking, the Carolingian and the Ottonian realms \nwere different entities. I think I cleared that point up earlier.\nI'm talking about the title/function of \u201eHoly Roman Emperor\u201c which I \nwouldn't suggest equating with the kingdoms the respective emperors reigned \nover.\nContemporaries didn't see a break in the continuation from Charlemagne to \nOtto I in that regard.
