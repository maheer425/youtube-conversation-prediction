I liked it on \nFacebook, and the first post I see is about the actually developers of the \ngame doing a live stream of the game itself on a website called Twitch.tv. \nBasically a gamer's streaming website with a chat box that the streamer can \ninteract with his community through. WELL, while watching the stream one of \nthe moderators for the developers chat, named Mika, noted she was having \nproblems with her Minecraft game to another one of the chatters. Given I \nwas obsessed with Minecraft at the time and basically knew the in's and \nout's of it, I sent her a private message to her inbox of twitch, asking if \nI could help. After a few hours of chatting we still couldn't get it fixed \nbut the stream ended and so we both left the website. I started up the game \nof SMITE, which if you don't actually know about it, it's a newer MOBA \nthat's come out like LoL, or DOTA2, and grouped up with one of my friends \nI'd met also from the stream. Turns out he was friends with the moderator \nMika, and invited her to the party we were in as well. Since we were in \nSkype, he invited her to skype, too! So we're all talking, having a jolly \ngood time, I mention I'm the one who was helping her with minecraft, \nsuggest adding each other, she agreed, we continued talking past the \ngameplay of SMITE, and come Oct 12, 2012 I asked her out because we loved \nspending time together playing games of all kinds (at the time it was more \nof just SMITE and Minecraft) and enjoyed spending time on Twitch, she said \nyes which was some what funny because we were kind of already in that huggy \nflirty kind of friendly relationship up to that point, and we've been \ntogether ever since. Let me also note that she lives in New York, and I \nlive in Tennessee. Long distance nerdfighteria like CAN work.\nAs an added bonus halfway through the relationship up to this point she \nasked what I was doing one day, and I told her watching youtube. She asked \nwhat I was watching, and I described to her the basic back and forth \nbetween two brothers through relatively awesome clips involving random \ntopics, and the first thing she says was \"Oh, that sounds a lot like \nvlogbrothers.\"  I MEAN REALLY!? THIS WOMAN IS A NERDFIGHTER TOO!? To this \nday she continues to blow my mind with things I learn about her and will \nprobably continue to learn about her for the rest of the, hopefully, long \ntime we spend together. Currently 'life' intervenes on any possibility of \nus actually being able to meet, basically due to financial issues, but one \nday soon we hope to at least be able to visit one another.\ufeff",
