I want to \nsay she put about 90,000 miles on it before she sold it.  Lot's of \nchildhood memories in that car.  One thing I remember was a knob on the A/C \nthat was for temperature control.  If you turned it to the far right there \nwas a setting that said \"desert only\".  I never got up the nerve to turn it \nto this setting!  Thanks for bringing back the memories!\ufeff",
