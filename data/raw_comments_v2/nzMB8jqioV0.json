They \ncan hold their breath over 100 minutes and dive to depths greater than 1500 \nmetres. Water pressure at such depths exceeds 170 atmospheres or over \n17,500 kilopascals (2500 pounds per square inch)! Our Pod 4 platform in \nBarkley Canyon is positioned at a depth of 894 m\u2014nearly 3 times the world \nrecord scuba diving depth of 318 m.",
