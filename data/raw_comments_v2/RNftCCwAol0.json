I considered what she \nsaid, but her argument was still fallacious. I used a personal anecdote to \nprovide evidence of a single case, not to provide a generalization about \nthe entire populous. In response to your comment about wage discrimination \nlaws, the lilly ledbetter fair pay act, while significantly improving the \nstate of affairs for women, has not rectified women's situation in respect \nto equal pay. Recent reports by the World Economic Forum, as well as the \nBureau of Labor statistics have shown a clear wage gap, not as a result of \njob choice, but as a result of a clear pay bias. I will not begrudge you \nyour opinion, although i totally am, sorry, i am a hypocrite. however, when \nyou deny the plight of women across america, and across the globe, it seems \na bit more ignorant than being a double Major in Gender Studies and \nEconomics. I have done extensive research on this topic as part of my \nsenior research paper. I've looked at both sides. I've seen data. The wage \ngap argument is closed. I will no longer respond to any more of your sadly \ndelusional and frankly, misinformed dreck. (google dreck. Its a fun word to \nsay. Dreck. Drrreeccckk. =| :D)",

I guess no source a New York Times \nauthor cites should be believed because he's just stating his opinion after \nall. \n\nYour actual position is that you personally witnessed one case of job \ndiscrimination, so there must be a wage gap. \n\nWhen you eliminate all other variables such as age, years of experience, \neducation, etc, the wage gap vanishes. This is fact. The supposed 70 cents \nto a dollar is mere correlation. \n\nAs for your NIH person, if that was true her employer is breaking the law \nbecause - and the president doesn't know this so I don't blame you - wage \ndiscrimination is already illegal.

Do you mean sex discrimination? \nThis is where lower wages are paid to to one person for doing the same work \nas another, purely because they are of a different sex/race/disability \n Hence, gender discrimination is where a women gets paid less for doing he \nSAME work as a man. Sure, men do more dangerous work. And rightfully get \npaid more. But the it'swhen they are doing the SAME work as a man, and yet \nget paid less anyway, that counts as sex discrimination.",

Same job, same credentials, same pay. \nThe disparity is that men choose to do more cumbersome, dangerous, or \nprofitable jobs than women. I mean, over 90% of truck-drivers are men, and \nit is an unskilled job which pays around $35/hour depending on who your \nworking for. Also, the highest-paying sector is oil & gas--a field which is \ndominated by men.\n\nWomen can decide to be truckers or work in the O&G field if they want to. \nThey just usually don't. And those jobs pay higher because of market \nforces, not sexism.",

One recent \nexample here in Canada was a MacLean's article titled Wage \nDisparity...something or other.

This is supposed to be a enraging display of gender inequality, \nbut applying a little logic would explain that the comparison is unbalanced \nas they are comparing the male dominated rig jobs, with the female \ndominated office jobs. Well you typically don't work 3-on-1-off, 12-hr \ndays, or need to wear flame retardant clothing and an H2S detector when \nyou're sitting in an office and going home every night.

I'm an employed academic economist, and it is general consensus \nbetween 99% of economists that the gender wage gap is either non-existent, \nor less than 2%. Some locations have wage gaps in favor of women, actually.\n\nThey came by that statistic by taking the average earnings of all men and \ncomparing them to the average earnings of all women. They don't account for \ntime spent working, career fields, experience, education, or anything else.\n\nTo illustrate my point, imagine a model economy with 15 men and 15 women \nand only two jobs (job A and job B). Job A pays $10 an hour and job B pays \n$20 dollars an hour. For whatever reason, 10 men and 5 women work at job A, \nwhile 5 men and 10 women work at job B. This could be because of personal \nchoice or societal pressures (maybe men are expected to work at job A while \nwomen are expected to work at job B even though there are no rules which \nsay they have to). Whichever of these is true is beside the point; what \nremains true is that regardless of gender, each worker is payed the same \nwage depending on which job they are doing.\n\nHowever, if you compare the averages, you find that men are making only 80% \nof what women are making. This could be used to lobby for more men's rights \nand affirmative action for men in the workplace, but it won't help because \nthere was absolutely NO WAGE DISCRIMINATION TO BEGIN WITH.\n\nThe original widely-reported assertion that women make less than men is \n\"Women in America,\" a study done by the Obama Administration in 2011. You \ncan find that here: \nwww.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/Women_in_America.pdf\n\nIf you want a legitimate study by professionals, I suggest you read \"The \nDeclining Importance of Race and Gender in the Labor Market\" by David and \nJune O'Neill.",
