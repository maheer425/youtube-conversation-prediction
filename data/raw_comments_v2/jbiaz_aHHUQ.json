            "text": "Thanks for another wonderful video!  It raises a couple of questions for me \nthat I'm hoping you or a commenter can answer.\n\n1) Why does the test stop at p?  For example, if you're testing whether 5 \nis prime, why isn't it of interest whether 6^5-6 is divisible by 5?  I'm \nsure there's something simple I'm missing.\n\n2) The Wikipedia article on Carmichael numbers uses a different \nformulation: a Carmichael number is a composite n such that b^n = b (mod n) \nfor 1<b<n), but instead of an equals sign, it uses a symbol I don't \nrecognize: three stacked parallel lines (like an equals with an extra \nline).  What's that mean?\n\nThanks!\ufeff",
