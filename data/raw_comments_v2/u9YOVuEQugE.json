There is another \none popping up that I found quite interesting that involves taking the \nbiggest fish, but only the biggest fish that are at the end of their \nreproductive potential.\n\nApparently, the rate at which fish reach the end of their reproductive \npotential are different between species and even different between \npopulations. The research suggests that instead of using absolute lengths, \nfishery managers use proportions (i.e. only harvest herring when they have \nreached 75% of their full length).\n\nHordyk, A. et al., 2011: \nhttp://www.researchgate.net/publication/236651920_A_cost-effective_alternative_for_assessing_the_size_of_deep-water_fish_aggregations\n\nPrince, J.D. 2003: \nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1467-2979.2003.00134.x/abstract;jsessionid=8B08B290E5B44590AFEC35269518DDD2.f02t03?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false\n\ufeff",

The \"theory of evolution\" is only a \nscientific explanation of how evolution works, in the exact same way that \nthe \"theory of relativity\" is an explanation of how gravity works. \nEvolution is nothing more than (quoting wikipedia) \"the change in the \ninherited characteristics of biological populations over successive \ngenerations.\" The theory of evolution is about how this happens, back in \nDarwin's day the best explanation for this was a concept called natural \nselection. Some concepts about it later became obsolete, and the theory has \nbeen polished throughout time to now include so many factors it'd be almost \nimpossible to mention all of them here.\nIn science you don't \"prove a theory,\" (especially since a theory already \nmeans \"proven hypothesis\") you only improve upon it. As for the things it \nexplains, you can prove evolution as much as you can prove gravity, both \nare phenomena that everyone knows to happen, science only tries to explain \nthem.\nAlso, to Mr. Campbell, there is no difference between micro-evolution and \nmacro-evolution, both are changes \"in the inherited characteristics\" of \nspecies, precisely the definition of evolution. There is absolutely no \ndebate on whether \"macro\" happens or not; the biggest extent of the debate \nin the scientific world (if anything) would be something like what plays a \nbigger role in evolution, genetic drift or genetic draft.",
