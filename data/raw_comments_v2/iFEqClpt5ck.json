The oil industry, the \nfailure of biodiesel, the cost to convert cars and gas stations to ethanol, \nDubai's economy, where the hell are we supposed to plant all this corn, and \ncompeting with other better alternatives like electric cars (which hold the \nland speed record) or hemp fuel which is cheaper to produce, easier to \nproduce, more efficient to produce, and better for the soil than corn aka \nethanol.\nAlso, I see what you're saying. Ethanol has lower gas mileage but it's so \ndamn cheap to produce and buy it just doesn't make any sense to run on oil \nanymore.\nThough I think ethanol is a very good solution to the problems we have \ntoday, with environmental standards and inflated gas prices, etc. I think \nhemp fuel is a better alternative for the average consumer, and electric \ncars are a better solution for performance cars.\nEthanol is definitely the middle ground here but we're not all united yet. \nUntil ethanol starts setting land speed records or we find a way to produce \nelectricity cheaper than we can produce oil, there won't be a new standard \nfor a long time.\nNot to mention, electric cars may have no emissions but power plants do. If \neverybody converts to electric, the amount of power nuclear plants will \nhave to produce will inevitably warm the globe considerably.\nHemp fuel may be the cheapest and most environmentally friendly option, but \nit's not necessarily the best for performance vehicles.\nAnd while ethanol may be great for saving money, it's also not good for \nperformance. Not at all.\nBut I think everybody can agree on one thing. Oil is the absolute worst \noption we have at the moment.",

Thatcher brokered a deal with DeLorean, \neffectively paying him to manufacture there.  It all ended in a big \nembarrassing mess of cocaine and cash.\n\nLoads of guys who worked for DMC are still knocking about.  My neighbor \nused to be one of the guys who drove-in all the new cars.  Just drove them \n'round the block to see if the wheels stayed on' to quote him.  \n\nThey still hold a huge legend status in NI.
