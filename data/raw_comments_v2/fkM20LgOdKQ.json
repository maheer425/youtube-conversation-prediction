Hydra has highest \nwaveclear out of all (Which you already have), and the second highest AD of \nall. And Ruined King is nifty for the attack speed and the damage against \nhigh HP opponents, With the lifesteal complementing the attack speed.

            "text": "People saying Yasuo is OP, and people saying that he sucks.... wow. Is he \nOP or not? He's pretty balanced tbh.\n\nThe \"OP\" things about him: Double Crit chance, low cooldowns, annoying as \nhell wall, and deals damage fast.\nThe solution: Ruin him early game, don't let him get farm, pressure him, \ngang up on him if you have to, Yasuo has many ways of coming back, and \ngetting tons of CS is one of them, once he hits Shiv, his farming power \nincreases exponentially, when he gets IE, he arguably becomes the best \nfarmer in the game, but that takes a while for him to get those items \nconsidering how much they cost in total, and he's VERY squishy early game, \nhis shield isn't really that high enough to save himself from a 3 man gank, \nhe may need to burn a flash and he might still even die doing so. His \ndamage with Shiv and IE is already high but he's still relatively weak, \nit's like having a Super Minion taking out basic waves, but against your \nMarksman that Super Minion is doing shit against you, think of the Marksman \nas you and your team, the Super Minion as Yasuo, and the Minions as... \nwell... Minions, or the prey of Yasuo. The Super Minion is OP against those \nMinions, and is very tanky, but against stronger forces, aka your Marksman, \nhe's gone in like a few hits.\nFor the things that make him \"suck\": Squishy, people too reliant on his old \npermashield thanks to his dash, the high number of his shield AND his old \nUlt range.\nThe solution: Be careful, just farm up early game, you don't need to kill \neveryone to get the same amount of gold and XP as last-hitting will, ward \noften, rush your items immediately, stick with your team if you guys can \ncoordinate well enough to hunt down people. Your shield isn't high, and \nyour defense sucks, but you make up for that with arguably the highest \nfarming potential in the ENTIRE game, thanks to your cooldown and how your \nkit works, if you guys were to have a race to reach full build first AND \nwithin a time limit, you, in theory, will be the first to reach it, \nespecially with Shiv, Yasuo is also a somewhat situational pick, He isn't \nweak by himself, but he isn't exactly the best, the thing that makes him so \nstrong his is his synergy with his allies, having a Wukong makes both of \nyou extra deadly, Wukong ults in, then you follow up, the damage that \nfollows is fast, and high. Having a Malphite sets up your ult again, Janna \ncan even poke from a range before you decide to go in, Or you can simply \nhave a good AoE lineup.\nExample: Kalista (Soul bounds with Nami)\nKatarina\nNami\nMalphite \nYasuo\nMalphite goes in, hopefully getting everyone, Nami follows up with her ult, \nreaching deep into the enemy's backline, where their Marksman should be \nhiding, once he gets knocked up, Yasuo ults onto their Marksman, while \nKalista throws spears damaging enemy team, while Katarina goes in and \nshreds everyone with her ult, at least those caught by the CC, the catch is \nthat this team has to be the one opening, and can't afford to fall behind.\n\nSo Yasuo can either be really strong OR real useless depending on \nindividual skill, enemy skill, team skill, and team comps.\ufeff",
