Steven Seagal seems to use kotagaeshi a lot in his films and its \nusually against an opponent with a knife. We often practiced it using \nwooden knives.\n\nI'll say this. If you dont know how to breakfall you can get seriously beat \nup with this technique.\n\nOn the street, it can best be used against someone that is grabbing your \nwrists, against someone that tries to grab you from behind, against someone \nwho is swinging a baseball bat at your head in a diagonal plane from above, \nor against someone that is trying to throw a right or left hook at your \nhead. If things go right they will not be getting up to go at you again.\n\nTo apply most Aikido in a street or police or a self defense context, \nthings should be already on a reflex level. A reflex response. They're \ncombative and they come past ma-ai, you respond. In any of those contexts \nma-ai is the key concept and it should be a very real thing to you to the \npoint that you just feel it the second they reach the ma-ai distance. Has \nto be like that and you should practice recognizing that in everyday life \njust as you should practice your breathing in motion and maintaining your \ncenter ( hara ). It must be a part of your life.\ufeff",

Aikido is a more intricate art than, say, Muay Thai (an art I \nalso have a great deal of respect for), and takes much longer to learn. I \nbelieve it is viable, and I've also studied Muay Thai, Xingyi, and Kenpo. \nHowever, having never used Aikido in a street fight, I won't claim \nexperience.\n\nHope that helps.",
