Also, he's \nalways spamming me on places like skype or steam asking for what classes we \nhave tomorrow. Because apparently \"He forgot his schedule at school\"! He's \ndone this more than 5 times already. He always has to come to ME to ask and \nnot his best friends. At school at the end of the day. I walk to the bus \nstop with my friends and he just waits around until we start walking. Two \ndays ago, he started walking behind us when we started walking and running \nwhen we tried running. The worst part is, he keeps trying even though he \nknows he lost to my boyfriend.\nI'm sorry to put my problems on you guys but I just really had to get it \nout there.\ufeff",
