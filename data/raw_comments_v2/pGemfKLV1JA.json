They weren't even *seen* or heard from in the \noriginal, and it bugged me that Robocop's family never tried to check up on \nhim...that I know of.\n\nThen, the ED-209s. They made *sense* in the remake, being military androids \ndeployed for military purposes outside the U.S. They even had smaller, but \nequally threatening counterparts (ED-208s? I forget.) filling up the ranks. \nThe original had the singular ED-209 proposed *as* *a* *freaking* *police \n_droid.* (Though, that was possibly for comedic overexaggeration, since the \noriginal movie never had ED-209 do all that much for how big and \nthreatening it was. Considering ED-209's defeat the hands of a simple \nstaircase...yeah, it was supposed to be silly.)\n\nThe acting in the remake was *phenomenal* as well; I don't think there was \na single bad performance in the film. (Not to say the original was badly \nacted! I'm not saying that! It's just noteworthy that the remake was \nwell-acted.)\n\nAnd...well, if I gush anymore I might have purist fans trying to yell at \nme. (To balance this opinion, I was not much of a fan of Disney's \nMaleficent, preferring the original, animated Sleeping Beauty. That remake \nwasn't a bad movie; I just didn't like it as much.)\n\nTL;DR, the 2014 Robocop is actually pretty good. Give it a try, grade it on \nits own merits before comparing to the original.\ufeff",
