Who else explains vampirism as a virus \nand bases a whole plot around drug development and includes so much ethical \ndebate in a drama?! For me it was even a bit interllectually stimulating \nand even tho the loveline is pretty much not really emphasised till much \nlater the drama element kept me on edge the whole time. The actor ahn \njaehyun (am a fan so am biased) i feel is tryin his best alr. And also ku \nhye sun, ive seen her past dramas n shes so different in this one - voice, \ntone etcetc some people find it unnatural cos its different frm usual but i \nwas like this is acting.... Shes definitely tried to put herself out there \nas her character...and i dont really see any major problems w them. The \nbest acting tho comes frm the villian ji jinhee.......just wow.. i think \npeople should just stick with the drama and give it a go till ep 4 or sth, \nits much more than ur av vampire story n not at all like twilight :)\ufeff",
