Everyone likes to get a quick \nnap in every now and then, but napping may be as much of an art as it is a \nscience. The Wall Street Journal offers recommendations for planning your \nperfect nap, including how long to nap and when.\n\nThe sleep experts in the article say a *10-to-20-minute* power nap gives \nyou the best \u201cbang for your buck,\u201d but depending on what you want the nap \nto do for you, other durations might be ideal.  For a quick boost of \nalertness, experts say a 10-to-20-minute power nap is adequate for getting \nback to work in a pinch.\n\nFor cognitive memory processing, however, a *60-minute nap* may do more \ngood, Dr. Mednick said. Including slow-wave sleep helps with remembering \nfacts, places and faces. The downside: some grogginess upon waking.\n\n\u201cIf you take it* longer than 30 minutes*, you end up in deep sleep. Have \nyou ever taken a nap and felt worse when you woke up? That\u2019s what\u2019s \nhappening \u2014 you\u2019re sleeping too long and you\u2019re going into a stage of sleep \nthat\u2019s very difficult to get out of.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Michael Breus\n\nFinally, the *90-minute nap* will likely involve a full cycle of sleep, \nwhich aids creativity and emotional and procedural memory, such as learning \nhow to ride a bike. Waking up after REM sleep usually means a minimal \namount of sleep inertia, Dr. Mednick said.\n\nIn fact, a study published in PubMed in 2002 found that napping even for \n5-10 minutes creates a heightened sense of alertness and increased \ncognitive ability in comparison to no nap.  So really, you want to be \ntaking a 10-20 minute nap for a quick recharge, or a 60-90 minute nap for a \ndeep sleep rejuvenation.\n\nIn addition to those recommendations, one surprising suggestion is to *sit \nslightly upright during your nap*, because it will help you avoid a deep \nsleep. And if you find yourself dreaming during your power naps, it may be \na sign you\u2019re sleep deprived.\n\nThe Scientific Power of Naps video\ufeff",
