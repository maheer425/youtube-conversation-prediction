Luckily, she \nnever succeeded. \nAfter many years of struggling, she and I were put into partners for a \ngroup project in history. We exchanged emails so that we could communicate \nfor the project. While working on the project, I mentioned that I would be \nable to a bit of work early in the morning. She asked why I would be up so \nearly, and I told her for Church Seminary.\nShe was very skeptical. She expressed a strong dislike for anything and \nanyone associated with church. I briefly shared my testimony, telling her \nthat I really DID believe God is there and that He loves us. The \nconversation ended there.\nTwo months later, she came to me, again, asking me a few questions in \nregards to the church. This eventually led to a conversation that spanned \nseveral days. Eventually, she asked if she could go to church with us.\nAt church, she felt, according to her, \"Something different. Something \nbetter\". She didn't understand what she felt, and asked more questions \nabout it. Eventually, I told her that she should pray about her questions. \nShe did.\nLater that week, she asked to come to church again.\nLess than a year later, I have seen her life change. She has more wholesome \nfriendships and the spirit about her is happier. Her life has truly changed \nbecause of God.\ufeff",
