Love ranks 4th \nor 5th on her list as that's what's been taught her entire life. She still \ncalls all the time, still texts and still tells me how much she loves me. \nCries, emails ...  I should have been gone over a year ago as her parents \nview me as a disease ... She is so confused just like Allie in this scene \n... She loves me as much as I love her and I constantly ask her the same \nquestion he asks her in this scene ... \"Forget about your parents, what do \nyou want?\" .... She always comes back no matter how controlling her parents \nare and no matter what she has been taught ... I see it in her eyes, I hear \nit in her voice and I feel it in my heart and hers ... I love her so much \nand all I want is to lay next to her every night and love her more each \nday. I see a lot of her in this character and I see a lot of me in his \ncharacter ... I love this movie because the similarities are scary and the \noutcome is magical ... Love does concur all and I will never give up on her \n(in a legal / non creepy / romantic way) lol ...

            "text": "+Yordanka O'Callaghan  I know that the only way out of this is by moving \nforward. Its just so hard to let go of someone who once made me so happy. \nThat one person who once made me feel so whole suddenly make me feel so \nbroken. I've had many broken bones, I've had plenty nasty injuries and \nillnesses, but none of those compare to the hurt and anger of seeing the \nman I love more that anything in this world turn his back on me and walk \naway. He was my first love and I don't feel ready to let go of that. But I \nrealize now that I don't have any other choice I have to stop sulking about \nit and move on from the past.. Thank you for taking your time in writing \nthat comment it helped a lot :) xx Life goes on I guess",

            "text": "+Annie Black this wounded feeling will pass, give yourself some time. Do \nnot blame Love for the shortcomings of someone. Learn to live without this \nman, learn to enjoy life in general, despite the gap that he left behind in \nyour heart. It will heal. I know its hard to believe me now, but I can \nassure you - it WILL heal. Do concentrate on the future, expect better \nthings, better life and most importantly- better man, who will appreciate \nyou. Sometimes people leave your life for only one reason - to make a space \nfor someone more suitable and good for you. :) Keep your head up and smile \n<3",
