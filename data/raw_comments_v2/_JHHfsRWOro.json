Lets go in order.\na) 1% more \"pro-choice.\" This is contradicted by the table below it so I \nassume as a former polltaker that a lot of people aren't sure what these \nlabels mean.\n1. You say my Siamese twins analogy is bad. I think it's good because it's \na case where the two people are physically connected and yet do not thereby \ngain the right to kill each other. You think its value as an analogy is \nundermined by the fact that Siamese twins sometimes can feel each other's \npain whereas mother and fetus cannot. I don't see how this is relevant. If \nanything, shared pain would be another reason to give each rights over the \nother's body, so the abortion case would be more favorable to my contention \nthat neither has a right over the other's body.\n2. You note that sometimes one Siamese twin can survive without the other \nbut the fetus cannot survive without the mother until late in pregnancy. I \ndon't consider the ability to survive outside the womb (\"viability\") \nrelevant to right to life. Many adults who have been injured are not viable \nwithout a team of surgeons but it's not okay to kill them. Newborns and \nsmall children cannot survive without assistance, but that's no excuse to \nkill them. The right to life would require viability only if it were \nunreasonable to ask a mother to put up with the inconvenience of pregnancy. \nWhere the pregnancy results from a voluntary sex act, undertaken with the \nknowledge that pregnancy could result, it is not unreasonable. If you buy a \ndog you take on the responsibility for its well-being and similarly if you \nconceive a human. Yes I know it's lopsided that only females have this \ninconvenience but that too fails to give you the right to kill little \nfemales!\n3. You say:Unlike Siamese twins first trimester fetuses are too undeveloped \nto think or feel pain. If that were true it would at most justify first \ntrimester abortions. I tend to doubt that a fully developed brain is \nnecessary to feel pain but I don't think anyone knows. I once asked a \nneurologist and he said that there's no scientific way to test what someone \nis feeling if they can't talk. btw surely a fetus is a human being. It's \nhuman and it's a (living) being and nothing else is needed! Personally I \nwould never cause suffering to kittens in the womb or puppies etc. Why we \nmake an exception for people is beyond me. If it could somehow be proved \nthat first trimester babies can't experience suffering then I would drop my \nsecular objections to abortion in those cases.",

I'm afraid that would be you my dear. 2) The fetus is not part of \nyour body in the relevant sense. Its body is connected to yours and is \ninside your womb but its brain, nervous system, feet, stomach, etc., are \nnot yours. You don't feel its pain. The best analogy is \"Siamese twins.\" \nThey share a circulatory system and certain body parts but neither has the \nright to kill the other on that account. When you create a human being you \nbecome responsible for it, except in the case of rape. I realize that \nnature has put the greater burden on women, but we make up for it by \nexempting them from forced military service, making it taboo to hit them, \ngiving them first shot at the lifeboats, etc. I agree that the word \n'murderer' should not be applied to women who have abortions. btw, you may \nhave noticed that roughly equal numbers say they are pro-life and \npro-choice.
