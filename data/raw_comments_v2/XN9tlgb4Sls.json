            "text": "+Panneer Yuvaraja OK, so let me begin.\nIf your just starting out, your going to want to have a good base to build \nfrom. Find out how many calories you require daily to maintain current \nweight, then aim for around 10-15% surplus to bulk. If you want to lose \nweight, aim for around 10-15% deficit.\nAs far as BCAA's are concerned, don't worry about them too much. Just look \nfor a whey protein that includes them.\nAs the hodgetwins referenced, Optimum Nutrition whey protein is a good \nplace to start, currently what i am using and it includes BCAA's (Branched \nChained Amino Acids) and Glutamine. \nCreatine is a good addition, but not essential at first, Just make sure you \ncycle with it. Casein Protein as far as im concerned is not really required \nfor a couple reasons, adds another $100 a month to your protein bill, and \nunless your training twice a day the use of it is not warranted, all it \ndoes is slowly digests in your stomach, essentially it turns into a gel in \nyour stomach, because sleep is the longest you usually go with out eating.\nIf your going to use a pre/post-work out, look for one that includes EAA's \n(Essential Amino Acids) Helps with recovery, these are the ones your body \ncan NOT produce naturally. I use Amino Energy by Optimum Nutrition.\n\nThe 3 things i use in terms of supplements are:\nOptimum Nutrition whey Protein.\nOptimum Nutrition Amino Energy.\nAxis Labs Monohydrate Creatine.\n\nOne more thing, A clean diet helps a lot.\n\nHope this helps dude.",

            "text": "It's all almost useless if you're eating a lot. The problem is eating a lot \nmay be complicated for many people. Back when I was getting big I would eat \na lot, all the time. A lot was something like, you go to a pizza place and \nask for the largest pizza with a lot of meat and eat everything by \nyourself. Then get some dessert. Then 3 hours later at home you eat a full \nplate of pasta with chicken of beef. My \"breakfast\" many times was 250g of \nspaghetti with 2 chicken breasts and 100g of parmesan cheese, all that with \na lot of either tomato sauce or cheese sauce. No faggoty lettuce and low \nfat stuff. After you get big, then you switch to supplements, and go to a \n\"normal\" healthy diet, with vegetables and lean meats, etc. It's kinda like \nthis, 1 kilogram of meat has 5 grams of creatine. But very few people eat \nthis much meat. And if you're not working out a lot, all the fat in this \namount of meat will make you fatter. So it's cheaper and wiser to eat \ncreatine as a supplement. Also, 1 liter of milk (about a third of a gallon) \nhas a little more protein than 1 scoop of whey protein. But it's much \neasier to just drink one glass of whey. 98% of the people I see rely too \nmuch on \"products\", and they don't grow (unless the products are steroids). \nIn order to make crazy gains naturally, you have to eat A LOT of all kinds \nof foods. This \"nice and clean\" only makes you grow considerably when \nyou're on heavy supplements and steroids.",
