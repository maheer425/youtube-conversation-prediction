Matter - \nantimatter Annihilation is by Definition the most efficient way \nto turn matter into energy: all of the rest mass of the particles turns \ninto energy. 100 % Efficiency compared to 0,7 % of proton-Proton Fusion. \nYes the Proton Proton Fusion circle produces 26,73 MeV of energy ( slightly \nless of that is usable since about 2-3% is carried away by Neutrinos that \ndon't interact with matter) so about 25 Mev is right , but that is per \ncircle ( 4 Protons are necessary to form a He4 Atom) so the energy would be \nabout 6 MeV per Proton which represents about 0,7 % of the mass of a \nProton. Compare that to the rest mass of the Proton of 938 MeV. Of course \nthe Proton Antiproton Annihilation is much more complex than that of e und \nPositrons but in any case the energy would be about 100 times more than \nFusion.

            "text": "Very interesting. I am not quite sure about what you mean though. Matter - \nantimatter Annihilation is by Definition the most efficient way \nto turn matter into energy: all of the rest mass of the particles turns \ninto energy. 100 % Efficiency compared to 0,7 % of proton-Proton Fusion. \nYes the Proton Proton Fusion circle produces 26,73 MeV of energy ( slightly \nless of that is usable since about 2-3% is carried away by Neutrinos that \ndon't interact with matter) so about 25 Mev is right , but that is per \ncircle ( 4 Protons are necessary to form a He4 Atom) so the energy would be \nabout 6 MeV per Proton which represents about 0,7 % of the mass of a \nProton. Compare that to the rest mass of the Proton of 938 MeV. Of course \nthe Proton Antiproton Annihilation is much more complex than that of e und \nPositrons but in any case the energy would be about 100 times more than \nFusion. Accelerating to the Speed of light is not the main Problem. \nEfficiency is.(ignoring here the physiological Limits of humans to \nsustained acceleration let's say about 10g).

It is not true that CERN scientists study antimatter \u201cin \ntheir research for future energy sources.\u201d CERN research on antimatter is \nbasically just studying the fundamental laws of physics.\n\nAntimatter is no more \u201cpowerful\u201d than regular matter. The energy released \nby a matter\u2013antimatter annihilation is simply the combined energy of the \ntwo particles. An anti-particle \u2014 say, an anti-proton \u2014 contains no more \nenergy than its opposite particle, a proton. Antimatter does not \u201cignite\u201d \nwhen it comes into contact with \u201canything\u201d; rather, every type of \nanti-particle annihilates on contact with its own corresponding particle of \nnormal matter. Thus, anti-protons annihilate on contact with protons, \npositrons annihilate on contact with electrons, and so forth.\n\nIf antimatter were a natural resource that could be \u201cmined\u201d and then \nannihilated with regular matter, it might be possible to use it as an \nenergy source, just as we burn wood in order to harvest the solar energy \nstored in the wood. However, wood could not be an energy source if there \nwere no sun and we had to grow trees under artificial light. The energy \nexpended in order to light the trees would always far exceed the energy \nharvested by burning the wood. The process would lose energy, not create it.\n\nThat\u2019s the situation in a nutshell with antimatter. The only way to get \nantimatter is to create it ourselves, at an enormous expenditure of energy. \nOf necessity, far more energy is expended in creating antimatter than could \never be harvested in annihilating it, just as more energy always goes into \ngrowing a tree than could ever be harvested by burning it.\n\nThus, while it may be true that a droplet\u2019s worth of antimatter could power \nNew York City for a month, the energy needed to create that droplet of \nantimatter in the first place would power New York for going on a billion \nyears. Even if, per impossibile, the technology improved so that we could \ncreate antimatter with 100% perfect efficiency, we would still never get \nout more than we put in. For this reason, there is absolutely no prospect \nof creating antimatter as an \u201cenergy source.\u201d\n\nIt would also, not incidentally, take billions of years to create enough \nantimatter to power New York for a month \u2014 or to blow up Vatican City. Most \nof the anti-particles created at CERN are immediately annihilated on \ncontact with their normal-matter particles. It is true that small amounts \nof (electrically charged) antimatter can be captured in an electromagnetic \ntrap. It is also true, as Brown claims in an opening FACT statement, that \nrecent experiments at CERN, notably the 2002 ATHENA and ATRAP experiments, \nsucceeded in creating millions of antihydrogen atoms at a time.\n\nHowever, the technology to generate a gram of antimatter is completely \nbeyond us, as is the technology to capture it. A gram of, say, \nanti-hydrogen would contain approximately 6.022 x 1023 atoms (a figure \ncommonly known as Avogadro\u2019s number). That is so much larger than the mere \nmillions of anti-hydrogen atoms CERN is currently capable of making that to \ncreate a gram of anti-hydrogen using this process would take billions of \nyears. It is also far more than the amount of anti-hydrogen containable \nwith present technology. \ufeff",

First, go watch the presentation that Dr. Harold White from \nNASA gave at the 2013 Starship congress. Its about an hour long and the \nmain topic of the presentation was about the results of his experiments \nwith warp drive. FYI, the results of the experiments were positive, but \nthat's not why I want you to watch the video.\n\nThe last 12 minutes or so of that video is about the experiments they have \nbeen doing on quantum thrusters, you may or may not know what a quantum \nthruster is, so for the sake of saving time, the quantum thruster works by \nutilizing the quantum vacuum fluctuations of empty space as a \"propellant\". \nWhat that means is that it captures the particles that pop into and out of \nexistence and uses those particles as the \"fuel\". They do not require a \nnormal source of fuel and the only thing they do consume is electricity. \n\nAnyway, a ship equipped with 10,000 of those q-thrusters could make the \ntrip from Earth to Mars in 28 days. That's with the q-thrusters set to a \npower output of 4 Newtons per kilowatt. Now 10,000 q-thrusters sounds like \na lot, but it would take up an area of 2 square meters. At 4 Newtons per \nkilowatt a ship travelling to Jupiter would take 61 days to get there, \nSaturn would take 86 days and a trip to Alpha Centauri would take 29 years!\n\nDr. White also talked about the fact that they had tested those q-thrusters \nup to a power output of 20 Newtons per kilowatt. At that power level the \ntrip to Mars take 17 days, and the trip to Alpha Centauri would take \nslightly less than 19 years. \n\nSo, as you can see, we already have the technology to make the trips and to \ndo it within the human lifetime. The only thing holding us back are the \nidiots that refuse to fund NASA to usable levels. It will take funding NASA \nat $50 billion per year for the next 15 years to make the big steps needed.\n\nWith a $50 billion budget, NASA could build a space elevator. Rice \nUniversity can make carbon nanotube thread any length you need it. Which is \nperfect for weaving the tether needed for the space elevator.\n\nThey could construct a real space station, one that's large enough to \nrotate and provide the people living and working on it with Earth normal \ngravity. They could construct asteroid mining facilities. They could build \nreal robust colonies on the moon and Mars and with all the steel being \nproduced by the asteroid processing facilities, they could build large \ncolony ships big enough to transport 250,000 colonists at a time. They \ncould build orbital farms that could grow enough food to completely end \nworld hunger.\n\nThere are so many advances that they could make with that level of funding \nthat it boggles the mind.",

I mean it could \nhappen, that before it arrives, someone construct a resolution for the \ndeflection or another faster method.\nAbout the warp drive: In my opinion is, that today it seems more unlikely \nthen an anti matter rocket, since the law of physics make the latter \npossible, but the warp drive...I'm not sure. I mean as far as I know it \nwould require exotic matter, but we are not able to find it yet, maybe it \nisn't exist at all.\n ",
