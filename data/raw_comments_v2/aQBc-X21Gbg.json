People plan their lives \nas if they are sure of destiny and know they get the full 80 years. But \nlife is unexpected, random and you can never know when your time is up. \nThat's why its important to chase your goals as best as you can. Hope you \nenjoy the this video. Next week will be fitness motivation. \ufeff",

I don't want to tell myself this worn out story that holds \nme back anymore. I want to grow. I want to reach my full potential. \n\n\nPeople that come to these sorts of videos can really see inside themselves, \nand know that they aren't the centre of the universe. It rubs off on to \npeople like me who don't usually come to videos like this. Keep your \npositive mindset on everyone, because we all know the biggest battles are \nfought within your mind.",

Or, our real worth. We scratch only the surface and are content. \n\nLife is a race against time as it races around the track night to day day \nto night. However do enjoy life as well, simple things like balancing \nfamily friends love entertainment food laughter sadness and all the \nwonderful things. If you get stressed and bogged down by racing all the \ntime it can hurt you by you missing out in certain things. \n\nTime management is a huge skill to have and I too am just a rookie and \ntrying to swim through the ocean.",
