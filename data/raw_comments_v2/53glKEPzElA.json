The mechanism for this emission is \nrelated to vacuum fluctuations in which a virtual pair of particles is \nseparated by the gravity of the hole, one member being sucked into the \nhole, and the other being emitted.\"\n\nPerhaps a star getting is simply brighter because the black hole can't emit \nenough light, heat, whatever shit because it isn't sucking enough in. As we \nsaw in the video the \"black hole area\" was small in comparison to some \nstars orbiting it. Perhaps the black hole is in a phase where it is \ngobbling up the last of a previous star but hasn't began to munch on any \nnew ones yet. So the stuff in the star is getting excited causing it to \nbecome brighter while the black hole is running out of fuel?\n\nOnly a theory, I'm not completely sure.",
