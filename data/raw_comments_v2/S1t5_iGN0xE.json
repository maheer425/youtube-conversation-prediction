            "text": "Taken from http://www.ucg.org/\n\nCharles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, as taught at school, is a biological \nexplanation of how creatures have supposedly \u201cevolved\u201d or developed \nprogressively through natural selection and variation (now known as \nmutation) over eons of time from the tiny cell to the largest creatures on \nearth today. What is taught in classrooms is not mere micro evolution\u2014small \nchanges within a species\u2014but macro evolution, the change from one type of \ncreature to another quite distinct life form.\n\nWhat many evolutionists are trying to convince you of is that there is no \nneed for a Creator since, as they say, evolution can substitute as the \nmechanism for creating and transforming life. They teach that life arose \nfrom non-life and evolved from simpler creatures to more complex life \nforms. In other words, the tiny cell eventually became an amoeba, then a \nlizard, then a monkey, and finally\u2014 you !\n\nIn order to remember key points that disprove Darwinian evolution\u2014the \n\u201cmolecules to man\u201d theory\u2014we\u2019ll use the acronym FALSE. (A few of these \npoints also disprove the compromise of theistic evolution\u2014the notion that \nGod employed macroevolution over eons in forming the creatures we see on \nearth today.)\n\n*F for Fossils*\n\nA fossil is the preserved remains of a living thing. The fossil record \naround the earth extends an average of one mile deep. Below this level we \ncome up with a blank slate as far as living, complex creatures are \nconcerned.\n\nI collect fossils of what are deemed the earliest type of complex creatures \nwith hard bodies\u2014trilobites. No previous ancestors of these arthropods have \nbeen found. Similar to some marine \u201cbugs\u201d we see today on the seashore that \ndisappear into the sand when the waves retreat, trilobites had hard shells, \nall the basic organs, and complex eyes like those of flies, with hundreds \nof sophisticated lenses connected to the optic nerve going to the brain. \nTrilobite fossils are found around the earth, and in all cases the level of \nrock beneath them does not reveal other creatures with similar features.\n\nAs one source states: \u201cThe dominant life form was the now-extinct sea \ncreature known as a trilobite, up to a foot long, with a distinctive head \nand tail, a body made up of several parts, and a complex respiratory \nsystem. But although there are many places on earth where 5,000 feet of \nsedimentary rock stretch unbroken and uniformly beneath the Cambrian \n[layer], not a single indisputable multi-celled fossil has been found \nthere. It is \u2018the enigma of paleontological [fossil studies] enigmas,\u2019 \naccording to Stephen Gould. Darwin himself said he could give \u2018no \nsatisfactory answer\u2019 to why no fossils had been discovered. Today\u2019s \nscientists are none the wiser\u201d (Francis Hitching, The Neck of the Giraffe , \n1982, pp. 26-27).\n\nQuestion: If, after almost two centuries of digging beneath all the world\u2019s \ncontinents, no previous ancestor of this first hard-bodied creature has \nbeen found, how then did the ubiquitous trilobite evolve? There should be \nsome previous ancestor if evolution were true.\n\nIt\u2019s like finding an exquisite watch on the seashore and yet never finding \nany previous primitive models of the watch on earth. If you reasoned as an \nevolutionist, you would deny there was a need for a watchmaker at all, \nmaintaining that time, water, sand, minerals and actions of the elements \nare sufficient to producing a fully functional watch that runs. This is \npart of the reason it takes more faith to believe in evolution than in a \nCreator!\n\nFurther important evidence from the fossil record is the absence of \ntransitional forms between species. Darwin was concerned that the thousands \nof intermediate stages between creatures needed to prove his theory were \nnot in evidence, but he expected they would eventually be found. Yet those \nthousands of missing transitional forms are still missing!\n\nAnother reference explains: \u201cIf throughout past ages life was actually \ndrifting over in one continual stream from one form to another, it is to be \nexpected that as many samples of the intermediate stages between species \nshould be discovered in fossil condition as of the species themselves \u2026 All \nshould be in a state of flux. But these missing links are wanting. There \nare no fossils of creatures whose scales were changing into feathers or \nwhose feet were changing into wings, no fossils of fish getting legs or of \nreptiles getting hair. The real task of the geological evolutionist is not \nto find \u2018the\u2019 missing link, as if there were only one. The task is to find \nthose thousands upon thousands of missing links that connect the many \nfossil species with one another\u201d (Byron Nelson, After Its Kind , 1970, pp. \n60-62).\n\nThe absence of transitional forms is an insurmountable hurdle for theistic \nevolutionists as well. It also fits with our next point.\n\n*A for Assumption*\n\nWhen there is no real evidence, evolutionary scientists simply make \nassumptions.\n\nIf evolution were true, then where is the evidence of different types of \nanimals now \u201cevolving\u201d into other types? Where is the evidence of cats, \ndogs and horses gradually turning into something else? We do see changes \nwithin species, but we do not see any changes into other species. And, as \nmentioned, we see no evidence of gradual change in the fossil record \neither. Yet evolutionists continue to assume that transitional forms must \nhave existed.\n\nIn Darwin\u2019s landmark book On the Origin of Species there are some 800 \nsubjective clauses, with uncertainty repeatedly admitted instead of proof. \nWords such as \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cperhaps\u201d and \u201cpossibly\u201d plague the entire book.\n\nEvolution is still called a theory\u2014a possible explanation or \nassumption\u2014because it is not testable according to the scientific method, \nas this would require thousands or millions of years. Evolutionists will \ncounter that a theory is not a mere hypothesis but is a widely affirmed \nintellectual construct that generally appears to fit all the facts. Yet \nevolution in no way fits all the facts available. Evidence does not support \nit\u2014and in many respects runs counter to it.\n\n*L for Life*\n\nThe law of biogenesis as taught in biology class states that only life can \nproduce life.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard the famous question: Which came first, the chicken or \nthe egg? It\u2019s a real dilemma for an evolutionist to answer. An egg comes \nfrom a chicken, yet the chicken comes from an egg. How can there be one \nwithout the other?\n\nTo complicate matters even more, the chicken has to come from a fertilized \negg that has the mixture of two different genetic strains from both its \nparents. So the problem of the origin of life and initial reproduction is \nstill a mystery that evolutionary science cannot adequately answer.\n\nYet for someone who believes in special creation by a Creator, there is no \ndilemma here. First God made the male and female chickens, which produced \nthe first fertilized egg\u2014and the rest is history.\n\n*S for Symbiosis*\n\nWhen one living thing needs another different living thing to survive, it\u2019s \ncalled a symbiotic relationship.\n\nA good example of this is the relationship between bees and flowers. The \nbees need the nectar from some types of flowers to feed while these flowers \nneed bees to pollinate them. Both depend on each other to exist and \nsurvive. The question for evolutionists is: How did these plants exist \nwithout the bees, and how did the bees exist without these plants?\n\nAgain, atheistic scientists are stumped. Theistic evolutionists are \nperplexed as well. Yet if you believe in a Creator who specially created \nthe various forms of life on earth, the answer is simple\u2014both were created \nat about the same time.\n\n*E for Engineering*\n\nAll living things are exquisitely engineered or designed. Qualitatively, a \nbacterium is as majestically built for its purpose as a human body is for \nits function. Yet evolution says it\u2019s only an illusion of design\u2014that there \nis no real designer behind it. Reality is not an illusion! Living things \nare multi-functional, which means they do many complex things at the same \ntime, something evolution with its step-by-step process has never been able \nto demonstrate.\n\nOne example of a living thing with exquisite engineering is the tree. It \nprovides breathable oxygen for us while processing carbon dioxide, which \nwould in high amounts in the air be toxic to us. It supplies wood, housing \nfor birds, roots to limit erosion, fruit and seeds to eat, is biodegradable \nand gives shade. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, \u201cA \nhealthy tree provides a cooling effect that is equivalent to 10 room-size \nair conditioners operating 20 hours a day.\u201d How could something so complex \narise from a random, undirected evolutionary process?\n\nAgain, you need more \u201cfaith\u201d to believe in blind evolution than in an \nall-knowing Creator who designed the marvelous tree in the first place.\ufeff",

How are these organisms in \nexistence if there was no evolution? Humans were most certainly not around \na 100 million years ago as a species while we have dated many fossil and \nrock formations as being hundreds of millions of years old.

It's like arguing that a couple of steps \nis not travelling, because the person hadn't walked a mile. The scale is \nirrelevant. We may not be able to see large changes happening before our \nvery eyes in real-time, but we see the evidence of them in the study of \nfossil record, comparative anatomy, comparative traits/behaviours, \npseudogenes and endogenous retroviruses.\nEven though we are discovering new things all the time, there are still \nmany gaps in our knowledge. Textbooks are not the most informative about \nthe exact journey that we have come, first because that type of detail is \nnot the focus of the syllabus, and second because the older a fossil is the \nslimmer its chance of preservation, and so the further back we go the more \nhazy our exact path becomes. Doesn't that raise questions in my mind? Sure, \nbut it doesn't raise doubts about the validity of evolution. The validity \nof evolution is rock solid through the evidences cited above.

(F=ma) or the Law of Gravity.. that \nwas a law that seemed to predict nearly everything about massive bodies \nuntil Einstein developed a general theory of relativity that further \nexplains gravity.. it could even be true that the theory of evolution is \ngood up to a point but suffers from certain limitations.. but in an \nenvironment where enough people outright deny a theory about change and \ndeny observations.. in that environment it would be really difficult to \nbecome a scientist who would somehow find a theory to replace evolution if \nthere should be anything that can better explain the observable facts that \nlife and organisms have changed throughout time.. someone might reply \"we \nalready have that.. it's called creationism\" which one would respond.. \ncreationism is not a theory too.. if it were.. it should be based on \nevidence.. but religion is all about having faith in the absence of \nevidence.. demanding that creationism requires evidence implies a lack of \nfaith in one's religion.. after all.. if God really did create Heaven and \nEarth.. if that's what actually happened.. then no theory.. not even \nevolution could change that..  no theory can in any way disprove what \nactually happened.. so there's no dilemma.. there should be no \ncontroversy.. we could simultaneously USE the theory of evolution to breed \ndogs or develop photosynthetic algae to create energy from the sun that we \ncan store and use instead of relying on fossil fuels.. and also BELIEVE in \na God or higher spirit that gives us light and inner strength through which \nwe may live through the turbulence of a darkest of starry nights to rise up \nthe morning after with a renewed sense of purpose.. \ufeff",

            "text": "What he didn't mention, or address:\n\nThe process of Natural Selection only works in reverse.  It only takes away \nfrom what exists - it does NOT create.  There is absolutely zero evidence \nin any circumstance or experiment that Natural Selection creates anything.  \nIt only takes from what exists, leaves the most fit, and those go on from \nthere. \n\nEvolution, on the other hand, proposes that things change over time, \nallowing Natural Selection to do it's job and weed out the \"bad\" things \nthat Evolution creates.\n\nWhere the conundrum comes in (and all but the most seriously hardened of \nEvolutionists agree) is that you have entire genus' or families which \nappear from literally nothing in the fossil record.  You go from algae to \nshellfish and jellyfish in literally an explosion (the Pre-Cambrian \nExplosion) of life.  This not only contradicts slow evolution over time, it \nalso contradicts the proposition that all life came from a single, shared \nlife form.  There is nothing \"less complex\" about the DNA of algae VS the \nDNA of shellfish, other than one has more genes than the other.  The DNA \nworks the same, the RNA works the same, the ribosomes, the proteins, the \nbasic cellular structures, etc.\n\nThe other conundrum is that no scientific evidence (laboratory or \notherwise) has proven that mutations ADD any material to DNA.  Mutations \nalways, always, in every scientific investigation or experiment to date \neither take away DNA, or shut off/turn on genes that should or shouldn't be \non - but the fact remains that the DNA was already present.  Take the \nSickle Cell Anemia supposed \"evolution\".  The DNA of these individuals is \nidentical to anyone else.  The only change is that certain genes are \ndeactivated or \"shut off\" that should be on.  And not only that, even \nthough the condition allows for resistance to a disease, it causes more \nproblems than it fixes.  Lack of oxygen uptake as well as the ability to \nfit through capillaries properly.  So, what would happen to these folks \nwithout modern technology?  Natural Selection would weed them out.  Meaning \nless people.  Meaning Evolution \"mutated\" DNA into a form that would be \nweeded out by Natural Selection.  The two process counter each other.  \nWhatever Evolution \"creates\", Natural Selection says, \"I don't think so\" \nand destroys it.  Even the fact that Salamanders or Fruit Flies loose their \neyes after so many generations in the dark is not proof of evolution.  \nThose flies and salamanders have IDENTICAL DNA to their sighted cousins.  \nSo where the change?  Something called Epigenetics allows the turning on \nand turning off of genes based on feedback from the body and, yes, these \nare inheritable. \n\nSo, sure, things \"evolve\" in the sense this video is talking about.  But \nnot in the sense that Evolution creates DNA and viable, useful changes in \nthe being.  And Natural Selection takes away and makes less from what is \nalready present.  And of every observation one can make in the world, the \nworld has been in a constant path of degradation and decrease since the \nPre-Cambrian Explosion.  Natural Selection is only taking away, and has \nbeen taking away at a faster rate than the supposed process of \"Evolution\" \ncan \"create\". \ufeff",

            "text": "Natural selection is based on the assumption that in nature there is a \nconstant struggle for survival. It favors organisms with traits that best \nenable them to cope with pressures exerted by the environment. At the end \nof this struggle, the strongest ones, the ones most suited to natural \nconditions, survive. For example, in a herd of deer under threat from \npredators, those individuals that can run fastest will naturally survive. \nAs a consequence, the herd of deer will eventually consist of only \nfast-running individuals.\n\nHowever, no matter how long this process goes on, it will not transform \nthose deer into another species. The weak deer are eliminated, the strong \nsurvive, but, since no alteration in their genetic data takes place, no \ntransformation of a species occurs. Despite the continuous processes of \nselection, deer continue to exist as deer.\n\nThe deer example is true for all species. In any population, natural \nselection only eliminates those weak, or unsuited individuals who are \nunable to adapt to the natural conditions in their habitat. It does not \nproduce new species, new genetic information, or new organs. That is, it \ncannot cause anything to evolve. Darwin, too, accepted this fact, stating \nthat \"Natural selection can do nothing until favourable individual \ndifferences or variations occur.\"7 That is why neo-Darwinism had to add the \nmutation mechanism as a factor altering genetic information to the concept \nof natural selection.\n\nWe will deal with mutations next. But before proceeding, we need to further \nexamine the concept of natural selection in order to see the contradictions \ninherent in it. \n\nThe essential assumption of the theory of natural selection holds that \nthere is a fierce struggle for survival in nature, and every living thing \ncares only for itself. At the time Darwin proposed this theory, the ideas \nof Thomas Malthus, the British classical economist, were an important \ninfluence on him. Malthus maintained that human beings were inevitably in a \nconstant struggle for survival, basing his views on the fact that \npopulation, and hence the need for food resources, increases geometrically, \nwhile food resources themselves increase only arithmetically. The result is \nthat population size is inevitably checked by factors in the environment, \nsuch as hunger and disease. Darwin adapted Malthus's vision of a fierce \nstruggle for survival among human beings to nature at large, and claimed \nthat \"natural selection\" is a consequence of this struggle.\n\nFurther research, however, revealed that there was no struggle for life in \nnature as Darwin had postulated. As a result of extensive research into \nanimal groups in the 1960s and 1970s, V. C. Wynne-Edwards, a British \nzoologist, concluded that living things balance their population in an \ninteresting way, which prevents competition for food. Animal groups were \nsimply managing their population on the basis of their food resources. \nPopulation was regulated not by elimination of the weak through factors \nlike epidemics or starvation, but by instinctive control mechanisms. In \nother words, animals controlled their numbers not by fierce competition, as \nDarwin suggested, but by limiting reproduction.8\n\nEven plants exhibited examples of population control, which invalidated \nDarwin's suggestion of selection by means of competition. The botanist A. \nD. Bradshaw's observations indicated that during reproduction, plants \nbehaved according to the \"density\" of the planting, and limited their \nreproduction if the area was highly populated with plants.9 On the other \nhand, examples of sacrifice observed in animals such as ants and bees \ndisplay a model completely opposed to the Darwinist struggle for survival.\n\nIn recent years, research has revealed findings regarding self-sacrifice \neven in bacteria. These living things without brains or nervous systems, \ntotally devoid of any capacity for thought, kill themselves to save other \nbacteria when they are invaded by viruses.10\n\nThese examples surely invalidate the basic assumption of natural \nselection-the absolute struggle for survival. It is true that there is \ncompetition in nature; however, there are clear models of self-sacrifice \nand solidarity, as well.\n\n\nApart from the theoretical weaknesses mentioned above, the theory of \nevolution by natural selection comes up against a fundamental impasse when \nfaced with concrete scientific findings. The scientific value of a theory \nmust be assessed according to its success or failure in experiment and \nobservation. Evolution by natural selection fails on both counts.\n\n\nMutations\nMutations are defined as breaks or replacements taking place in the DNA \nmolecule, which is found in the nuclei of the cells of a living organism \nand which contains all its genetic information. These breaks or \nreplacements are the result of external effects such as radiation or \nchemical action. Every mutation is an \"accident,\" and either damages the \nnucleotides making up the DNA or changes their locations. Most of the time, \nthey cause so much damage and modification that the cell cannot repair them.\n\nMutation, which evolutionists frequently hide behind, is not a magic wand \nthat transforms living organisms into a more advanced and perfect form. The \ndirect effect of mutations is harmful. The changes effected by mutations \ncan only be like those experienced by people in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and \nChernobyl: that is, death, disability, and freaks of nature\u2026\n\nThe reason for this is very simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and \nrandom effects can only damage it. Biologist B. G. Ranganathan states:\n\nFirst, genuine mutations are very rare in nature. Secondly, most mutations \nare harmful since they are random, rather than orderly changes in the \nstructure of genes; any random change in a highly ordered system will be \nfor the worse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to \nshake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be a \nrandom change in the framework of the building, which, in all probability, \nwould not be an improvement.19\n\nNot surprisingly, no useful mutation has been so far observed. All \nmutations have proved to be harmful. The evolutionist scientist Warren \nWeaver comments on the report prepared by the Committee on Genetic Effects \nof Atomic Radiation, which had been formed to investigate mutations that \nmight have been caused by the nuclear weapons used in the Second World War:\n\nMany will be puzzled about the statement that practically all known mutant \ngenes are harmful. For mutations are a necessary part of the process of \nevolution. How can a good effect-evolution to higher forms of life-result \nfrom mutations practically all of which are harmful?20\n\nEvery effort put into \"generating a useful mutation\" has resulted in \nfailure. For decades, evolutionists carried out many experiments to produce \nmutations in fruit flies, as these insects reproduce very rapidly and so \nmutations would show up quickly. Generation upon generation of these flies \nwere mutated, yet no useful mutation was ever observed. The evolutionist \ngeneticist Gordon Taylor writes thus:\n\nIt is a striking, but not much mentioned fact that, though geneticists have \nbeen breeding fruit-flies for sixty years or more in labs all round the \nworld- flies which produce a new generation every eleven days-they have \nnever yet seen the emergence of a new species or even a new enzyme.21\n\nAnother researcher, Michael Pitman, comments on the failure of the \nexperiments carried out on fruit flies:\n\nMorgan, Goldschmidt, Muller, and other geneticists have subjected \ngenerations of fruit flies to extreme conditions of heat, cold, light, \ndark, and treatment by chemicals and radiation. All sorts of mutations, \npractically all trivial or positively deleterious, have been produced. \nMan-made evolution? Not really: Few of the geneticists' monsters could have \nsurvived outside the bottles they were bred in. In practice mutants die, \nare sterile, or tend to revert to the wild type.22\n\nThe same holds true for man. All mutations that have been observed in human \nbeings have had deleterious results. All mutations that take place in \nhumans result in physical deformities, in infirmities such as mongolism, \nDown syndrome, albinism, dwarfism or cancer. Needless to say, a process \nthat leaves people disabled or sick cannot be \"an evolutionary \nmechanism\"-evolution is supposed to produce forms that are better fitted to \nsurvive.\n\nThe American pathologist David A. Demick notes the following in a \nscientific article about mutations:\n\nLiterally thousands of human diseases associated with genetic mutations \nhave been catalogued in recent years, with more being described \ncontinually. A recent reference book of medical genetics listed some 4,500 \ndifferent genetic diseases. Some of the inherited syndromes characterized \nclinically in the days before molecular genetic analysis (such as Marfan's \nsyndrome) are now being shown to be heterogeneous; that is, associated with \nmany different mutations... With this array of human diseases that are \ncaused by mutations, what of positive effects? With thousands of examples \nof harmful mutations readily available, surely it should be possible to \ndescribe some positive mutations if macroevolution is true. These would be \nneeded not only for evolution to greater complexity, but also to offset the \ndownward pull of the many harmful mutations. But, when it comes to \nidentifying positive mutations, evolutionary scientists are strangely \nsilent.23\n\nThe only instance evolutionary biologists give of \"useful mutation\" is the \ndisease known as sickle cell anemia. In this, the hemoglobin molecule, \nwhich serves to carry oxygen in the blood, is damaged as a result of \nmutation, and undergoes a structural change. As a result of this, the \nhemoglobin molecule's ability to carry oxygen is seriously impaired. People \nwith sickle cell anemia suffer increasing respiratory difficulties for this \nreason. However, this example of mutation, which is discussed under blood \ndisorders in medical textbooks, is strangely evaluated by some evolutionary \nbiologists as a \"useful mutation.\"\n\nThey say that the partial immunity to malaria by those with the illness is \na \"gift\" of evolution. Using the same logic, one could say that, since \npeople born with genetic leg paralysis are unable to walk and so are saved \nfrom being killed in traffic accidents, therefore genetic leg paralysis is \na \"useful genetic feature.\" This logic is clearly totally unfounded.\n\nIt is obvious that mutations are solely a destructive mechanism. \nPierre-Paul Grass\u00e9, former president of the French Academy of Sciences, is \nquite clear on this point in a comment he made about mutations. Grass\u00e9 \ncompared mutations to \"making mistakes in the letters when copying a \nwritten text.\" And as with mutations, letter mistakes cannot give rise to \nany information, but merely damage such information as already exists. \nGrass\u00e9 explained this fact in this way:\n\nMutations, in time, occur incoherently. They are not complementary to one \nanother, nor are they cumulative in successive generations toward a given \ndirection. They modify what preexists, but they do so in disorder, no \nmatter how\u2026. As soon as some disorder, even slight, appears in an organized \nbeing, sickness, then death follow. There is no possible compromise between \nthe phenomenon of life and anarchy.24\nSo for that reason, as Grass\u00e9 puts it, \"No matter how numerous they may be, \nmutations do not produce any kind of evolution.\"25\n\n\n\nThe Pleiotropic Effect\nThe most important proof that mutations lead only to damage, is the process \nof genetic coding. Almost all of the genes in a fully developed living \nthing carry more than one piece of information. For instance, one gene may \ncontrol both the height and the eye color of that organism. Microbiologist \nMichael Denton explains this characteristic of genes in higher organisms \nsuch as human beings, in this way:\n\nThe effects of genes on development are often surprisingly diverse. In the \nhouse mouse, nearly every coat-colour gene has some effect on body size. \nOut of seventeen x-ray induced eye colour mutations in the fruit fly \nDrosophila melanogaster, fourteen affected the shape of the sex organs of \nthe female, a characteristic that one would have thought was quite \nunrelated to eye colour. Almost every gene that has been studied in higher \norganisms has been found to effect more than one organ system, a multiple \neffect which is known as pleiotropy. As Mayr argues in Population, Species \nand Evolution: \"It is doubtful whether any genes that are not pleiotropic \nexist in higher organisms.\"26\n\nBecause of this characteristic of the genetic structure of living things, \nany coincidental change because of a mutation, in any gene in the DNA, will \naffect more than one organ. Consequently, this mutation will not be \nrestricted to one part of the body, but will reveal more of its destructive \nimpact. Even if one of these impacts turns out to be beneficial, as a \nresult of a very rare coincidence, the unavoidable effects of the other \ndamage it causes will more than outweigh those benefits.\n\nTo summarize, there are three main reasons why mutations cannot make \nevolution possible:\n\nl- The direct effect of mutations is harmful: Since they occur randomly, \nthey almost always damage the living organism that undergoes them. Reason \ntells us that unconscious intervention in a perfect and complex structure \nwill not improve that structure, but will rather impair it. Indeed, no \n\"useful mutation\" has ever been observed.\n\n2- Mutations add no new information to an organism's DNA: The particles \nmaking up the genetic information are either torn from their places, \ndestroyed, or carried off to different places. Mutations cannot make a \nliving thing acquire a new organ or a new trait. They only cause \nabnormalities like a leg sticking out of the back, or an ear from the \nabdomen.\n\n3- In order for a mutation to be transferred to the subsequent generation, \nit has to have taken place in the reproductive cells of the organism: A \nrandom change that occurs in a cell or organ of the body cannot be \ntransferred to the next generation. For example, a human eye altered by the \neffects of radiation, or by other causes, will not be passed on to \nsubsequent generations.\n\nAll the explanations provided above indicate that natural selection and \nmutation have no evolutionary effect at all. So far, no observable example \nof \"evolution\" has been obtained by this method. Sometimes, evolutionary \nbiologists claim that \"they cannot observe the evolutionary effect of \nnatural selection and mutation mechanisms since these mechanisms take place \nonly over an extended period of time.\" However, this argument, which is \njust a way of making themselves feel better, is baseless, in the sense that \nit lacks any scientific foundation. During his lifetime, a scientist can \nobserve thousands of generations of living things with short life spans \nsuch as fruit flies or bacteria, and still observe no \"evolution.\" \nPierre-Paul Grass\u00e9 states the following about the unchanging nature of \nbacteria, a fact which invalidates evolution:\n\nBacteria ...are the organisms which, because of their huge numbers, produce \nthe most mutants. acteria ...exhibit a great fidelity to their species. The \nbacillus Escherichia coli, whose mutants have been studied very carefully, \nis the best example. The reader will agree that it is surprising, to say \nthe least, to want to prove evolution and to discover its mechanisms and \nthen to choose as a material for this study a being which practically \nstabilized a billion years ago! What is the use of their unceasing \nmutations, if they do not [produce evolutionary] change? In sum, the \nmutations of bacteria and viruses are merely hereditary fluctuations around \na median position; a swing to the right, a swing to the left, but no final \nevolutionary effect. Cockroaches, which are one of the most venerable \nliving insect groups, have remained more or less unchanged since the \nPermian, yet they have undergone as many mutations as Drosophila, a \nTertiary insect. 27\n\nBriefly, it is impossible for living beings to have evolved, because there \nexists no mechanism in nature that can cause evolution. Furthermore, this \nconclusion agrees with the evidence of the fossil record, which does not \ndemonstrate the existence of a process of evolution, but rather just the \ncontrary.\n7 Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, The \nModern Library, New York, p. 127.

            "text": "Where your argument went off the rails is you misunderstanding of what \nfitness means. \nFitness doesn't mean weak or strong. Nor is running fast the only trait \nthat gets selected for. \n\nI'm going to go into crazy hyperbole land to make the point clear, in real \nlife it's much more subtle. \nSay a deer gets a mutation that allows it to eat rocks. This deer can \nexploit a resource that no other animal can. It breeds and passes it's \nmutation on. Over time there is a population of deer that can eat rocks.\nNow. Let's say a drought hits and all the plant life dies off. The deer \nthat can eat rocks are unaffected, the deer that can't eat rocks move on to \ngreener pastures. Over time the once green fields and forests get uplifted \ninto a hilly mountain terrain, another one of these rock eating deer gets a \nmutation that gives it shorter legs, now these short legged deer are much \nmore sure footed with a lower center of gravity, they don't fall off \ncliffs, and if the trip and fall down a steep mountainside, they are less \nlikely to have their legs injured. This is an advantageous trait to have \nand so over time this population of deer is shorter than the original \npopulation of deer. \nNow, The mountains are cold places, and it so happens that a deer had a \nmutation that gave it a wooly coat, it was better protected against the \ncold from the straight haired variety, so, eventually the trait passed on \nto the entire population of deer. \nNow. Compare my crazy land deer to the original population. \nWould you be correct in saying that they are the same type of deer? I \nwouldn't. They are drastically different. They can eat rocks, they have \nshort stumpy legs, and have wooly coats. \n\nOf course. This is just a fiction I made up. \nA far more subtle example would be the Key deer of florida. \nThese little guys are the size of a large dog. They don't look much \ndifferent than their white Tailed cousins on the peninsula. \nWhat happened?\nWell, there was a time where the keys were connected to the mainland. A \npopulation of deer moved in and the keys split off from the peninsula. \nSince islands have low resources, and few predators, it's not advantageous \nto be big or fast. It's better to be small. So, over time the mainland deer \naccumulated mutations that made them smaller than their mainland cousins. \nThe big deer didn't do as well on the island, so they didn't reproduce \nnearly as much. The tiny deer trait passed on to the rest of the \npopulation. \nI can already hear your objection \"but they are still deer!\" Of course they \nare still deer. But they aren't the same species. The differences built up \nover time and they can't interbreed anymore. \nThat's all evolution is. It's change over time. Give enough time and you'll \nhave more specialized creatures. That's exactly what we observe in the \nfossils. Simple creatures becomeing more complex and specialized.",

            "text": "Natural selection produces nothing new. NOTHING!!. It cannot be used to \nexplain how creatures came into being from other creatures.\n\n\nThe concept of natural selection was the basis of Darwinism. This assertion \nis stressed even in the title of the book in which Darwin proposed his \ntheory: The Origin of Species, by means of Natural Selection\u2026\n\nNatural selection is based on the assumption that in nature there is a \nconstant struggle for survival. It favors organisms with traits that best \nenable them to cope with pressures exerted by the environment. At the end \nof this struggle, the strongest ones, the ones most suited to natural \nconditions, survive. For example, in a herd of deer under threat from \npredators, those individuals that can run fastest will naturally survive. \nAs a consequence, the herd of deer will eventually consist of only \nfast-running individuals.\n\nHowever, no matter how long this process goes on, it will not transform \nthose deer into another species. The weak deer are eliminated, the strong \nsurvive, but, since no alteration in their genetic data takes place, no \ntransformation of a species occurs. Despite the continuous processes of \nselection, deer continue to exist as deer.\n\nThe deer example is true for all species. In any population, natural \nselection only eliminates those weak, or unsuited individuals who are \nunable to adapt to the natural conditions in their habitat. It does not \nproduce new species, new genetic information, or new organs. That is, it \ncannot cause anything to evolve. Darwin, too, accepted this fact, stating \nthat \"Natural selection can do nothing until favourable individual \ndifferences or variations occur.\"7 That is why neo-Darwinism had to add the \nmutation mechanism as a factor altering genetic information to the concept \nof natural selection.\n\nWe will deal with mutations next. But before proceeding, we need to further \nexamine the concept of natural selection in order to see the contradictions \ninherent in it.\n\n\nThe essential assumption of the theory of natural selection holds that \nthere is a fierce struggle for survival in nature, and every living thing \ncares only for itself. At the time Darwin proposed this theory, the ideas \nof Thomas Malthus, the British classical economist, were an important \ninfluence on him. Malthus maintained that human beings were inevitably in a \nconstant struggle for survival, basing his views on the fact that \npopulation, and hence the need for food resources, increases geometrically, \nwhile food resources themselves increase only arithmetically. The result is \nthat population size is inevitably checked by factors in the environment, \nsuch as hunger and disease. Darwin adapted Malthus's vision of a fierce \nstruggle for survival among human beings to nature at large, and claimed \nthat \"natural selection\" is a consequence of this struggle.\n\nFurther research, however, revealed that there was no struggle for life in \nnature as Darwin had postulated. As a result of extensive research into \nanimal groups in the 1960s and 1970s, V. C. Wynne-Edwards, a British \nzoologist, concluded that living things balance their population in an \ninteresting way, which prevents competition for food. Animal groups were \nsimply managing their population on the basis of their food resources. \nPopulation was regulated not by elimination of the weak through factors \nlike epidemics or starvation, but by instinctive control mechanisms. In \nother words, animals controlled their numbers not by fierce competition, as \nDarwin suggested, but by limiting reproduction.8\n\nEven plants exhibited examples of population control, which invalidated \nDarwin's suggestion of selection by means of competition. The botanist A. \nD. Bradshaw's observations indicated that during reproduction, plants \nbehaved according to the \"density\" of the planting, and limited their \nreproduction if the area was highly populated with plants.9 On the other \nhand, examples of sacrifice observed in animals such as ants and bees \ndisplay a model completely opposed to the Darwinist struggle for survival.\n\nIn recent years, research has revealed findings regarding self-sacrifice \neven in bacteria. These living things without brains or nervous systems, \ntotally devoid of any capacity for thought, kill themselves to save other \nbacteria when they are invaded by viruses.10\n\nThese examples surely invalidate the basic assumption of natural \nselection-the absolute struggle for survival. It is true that there is \ncompetition in nature; however, there are clear models of self-sacrifice \nand solidarity, as well.\n\n\nApart from the theoretical weaknesses mentioned above, the theory of \nevolution by natural selection comes up against a fundamental impasse when \nfaced with concrete scientific findings. The scientific value of a theory \nmust be assessed according to its success or failure in experiment and \nobservation. Evolution by natural selection fails on both counts.\n\nSince Darwin's time, there has not been a single shred of evidence put \nforward to show that natural selection causes living things to evolve. \nColin Patterson, the senior paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural \nHistory in London and a prominent evolutionist, stresses that natural \nselection has never been observed to have the ability to cause things to \nevolve:\n\nNo one has ever produced a species by the mechanisms of natural selection. \nNo one has ever got near it, and most of the current argument in \nneo-Darwinism is about this question.11\n\nPierre-Paul Grass\u00e9, a well-known French zoologist and critic of Darwinism, \nhas these words to say in \"Evolution and Natural Selection,\" a chapter of \nhis book The Evolution of Living Organisms.\n\nThe \"evolution in action\" of J. Huxley and other biologists is simply the \nobservation of demographic facts, local fluctuations of genotypes, \ngeographical distributions. Often the species concerned have remained \npractically unchanged for hundreds of centuries! Fluctuation as a result of \ncircumstances, with prior modification of the genome, does not imply \nevolution, and we have tangible proof of this in many panchronic species \n[i.e. living fossils that remain unchanged for millions of years].12\n\nA close look at a few \"observed examples of natural selection\" presented by \nbiologists who advocate the theory of evolution, would reveal that, in \nreality, they do not provide any evidence for evolution.\n\nThe True Story Of The Industrial Melanism\nWhen evolutionist sources are examined, one inevitably sees that the \nexample of moths in England during the Industrial Revolution is cited as an \nexample of evolution by natural selection. This is put forward as the most \nconcrete example of evolution observed, in textbooks, magazines, and even \nacademic sources. In actuality, though, that example has nothing to do with \nevolution at all.\n\nLet us first recall what is actually said: According to this account, \naround the onset of the Industrial Revolution in England, the color of tree \nbarks around Manchester was quite light. Because of this, dark-colored \nmoths resting on those trees could easily be noticed by the birds that fed \non them, and therefore they had very little chance of survival. Fifty years \nlater, in woodlands where industrial pollution has killed the lichens, the \nbark of the trees had darkened, and now the light-colored moths became the \nmost hunted, since they were the most easily noticed. As a result, the \nproportion of light-colored to dark-colored moths decreased. Evolutionists \nbelieve this to be a great piece of evidence for their theory. They take \nrefuge and solace in window-dressing, showing how light-colored moths \n\"evolved\" into dark-colored ones.\n\n\nHowever, although we believe these facts to be correct, it should be quite \nclear that they can in no way be used as evidence for the theory of \nevolution, since no new form arose that had not existed before. Dark \ncolored moths had existed in the moth population before the Industrial \nRevolution. Only the relative proportions of the existing moth varieties in \nthe population changed. The moths had not acquired a new trait or organ, \nwhich would cause \"speciation.\"13 In order for one moth species to turn \ninto another living species, a bird for example, new additions would have \nhad to be made to its genes. That is, an entirely separate genetic program \nwould have had to be loaded so as to include information about the physical \ntraits of the bird.\n\nThis is the answer to be given to the evolutionist story of Industrial \nMelanism. However, there is a more interesting side to the story: Not just \nits interpretation, but the story itself is flawed. As molecular biologist \nJonathan Wells explains in his book Icons of Evolution, the story of the \npeppered moths, which is included in every evolutionary biology book and \nhas therefore, become an \"icon\" in this sense, does not reflect the truth. \nWells discusses in his book how Bernard Kettlewell's experiment, which is \nknown as the \"experimental proof\" of the story, is actually a scientific \nscandal. Some basic elements of this scandal are:\n\n- Many experiments conducted after Kettlewell's revealed that only one type \nof these moths rested on tree trunks, and all other types preferred to rest \nbeneath small, horizontal branches. Since 1980 it has become clear that \npeppered moths do not normally rest on tree trunks. In 25 years of \nfieldwork, many scientists such as Cyril Clarke and Rory Howlett, Michael \nMajerus, Tony Liebert, and Paul Brakefield concluded that in Kettlewell's \nexperiment, moths were forced to act atypically, therefore, the test \nresults could not be accepted as scientific.14\n\n- Scientists who tested Kettlewell's conclusions came up with an even more \ninteresting result: Although the number of light moths would be expected to \nbe larger in the less polluted regions of England, the dark moths there \nnumbered four times as many as the light ones. This meant that there was no \ncorrelation between the moth population and the tree trunks as claimed by \nKettlewell and repeated by almost all evolutionist sources.\n\n- As the research deepened, the scandal changed dimension: \"The moths on \ntree trunks\" photographed by Kettlewell, were actually dead moths. \nKettlewell used dead specimens glued or pinned to tree trunks and then \nphotographed them. In truth, there was little chance of taking such a \npicture as the moths rested not on tree trunks but underneath the leaves.15\n\nThese facts were uncovered by the scientific community only in the late \n1990s. The collapse of the myth of Industrial Melanism, which had been one \nof the most treasured subjects in \"Introduction to Evolution\" courses in \nuniversities for decades, greatly disappointed evolutionists. One of them, \nJerry Coyne, remarked:\n\nMy own reaction resembles the dismay attending my discovery, at the age of \nsix, that it was my father and not Santa who brought the presents on \nChristmas Eve.16\n\nThus, \"the most famous example of natural selection\" was relegated to the \ntrash-heap of history as a scientific scandal-which was inevitable, because \nnatural selection is not an \"evolutionary mechanism,\" contrary to what \nevolutionists claim.\n\nIn short, natural selection is capable neither of adding a new organ to a \nliving organism, nor of removing one, nor of changing an organism of one \nspecies into that of another. The \"greatest\" evidence put forward since \nDarwin has been able to go no further than the \"industrial melanism\" of \nmoths in England.\n\n\nWhy Natural Selection Can Not Explain Complexity?\n\nAs we showed at the beginning, the greatest problem for the theory of \nevolution by natural selection, is that it cannot enable new organs or \ntraits to emerge in living things. Natural selection cannot develop a \nspecies' genetic data; therefore, it cannot be used to account for the \nemergence of new species. The greatest defender of the theory of punctuated \nequilibrium, Stephen Jay Gould, refers to this impasse of natural selection \nas follows;\n\nThe essence of Darwinism lies in a single phrase: natural selection is the \ncreative force of evolutionary change. No one denies that selection will \nplay a negative role in eliminating the unfit. Darwinian theories require \nthat it create the fit as well.17\n\nAnother of the misleading methods that evolutionists employ on the issue of \nnatural selection is their effort to present this mechanism as an \nintelligent designer. However,natural selection has no intelligence. It \ndoes not possess a will that can decide what is good and what is bad for \nliving things. As a result, natural selection cannot explain biological \nsystems and organs that possess the feature of \"irreducible complexity\". \nThese systems and organs are composed of a great number of parts \ncooperating together, and are of no use if even one of these parts is \nmissing or defective. (For example, the human eye does not function unless \nit exists with all its components intact).\n\nTherefore, the will that brings all these parts together should be able to \nforesee the future and aim directly at the advantage that is to be acquired \nat the final stage. Since natural selection has no consciousness or will, \nit can do no such thing. This fact, which demolishes the foundations of the \ntheory of evolution, also worried Darwin, who wrote: \"If it could be \ndemonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have \nbeen formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would \nabsolutely break down.\"18\n\nMutations\nMutations are defined as breaks or replacements taking place in the DNA \nmolecule, which is found in the nuclei of the cells of a living organism \nand which contains all its genetic information. These breaks or \nreplacements are the result of external effects such as radiation or \nchemical action. Every mutation is an \"accident,\" and either damages the \nnucleotides making up the DNA or changes their locations. Most of the time, \nthey cause so much damage and modification that the cell cannot repair them.\n\nMutation, which evolutionists frequently hide behind, is not a magic wand \nthat transforms living organisms into a more advanced and perfect form. The \ndirect effect of mutations is harmful. The changes effected by mutations \ncan only be like those experienced by people in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and \nChernobyl: that is, death, disability, and freaks of nature\u2026\n\nThe reason for this is very simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and \nrandom effects can only damage it. Biologist B. G. Ranganathan states:\n\nFirst, genuine mutations are very rare in nature. Secondly, most mutations \nare harmful since they are random, rather than orderly changes in the \nstructure of genes; any random change in a highly ordered system will be \nfor the worse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to \nshake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be a \nrandom change in the framework of the building, which, in all probability, \nwould not be an improvement.19\n\nNot surprisingly, no useful mutation has been so far observed. All \nmutations have proved to be harmful. The evolutionist scientist Warren \nWeaver comments on the report prepared by the Committee on Genetic Effects \nof Atomic Radiation, which had been formed to investigate mutations that \nmight have been caused by the nuclear weapons used in the Second World War:\n\nMany will be puzzled about the statement that practically all known mutant \ngenes are harmful. For mutations are a necessary part of the process of \nevolution. How can a good effect-evolution to higher forms of life-result \nfrom mutations practically all of which are harmful?20\n\nEvery effort put into \"generating a useful mutation\" has resulted in \nfailure. For decades, evolutionists carried out many experiments to produce \nmutations in fruit flies, as these insects reproduce very rapidly and so \nmutations would show up quickly. Generation upon generation of these flies \nwere mutated, yet no useful mutation was ever observed. The evolutionist \ngeneticist Gordon Taylor writes thus:\n\nIt is a striking, but not much mentioned fact that, though geneticists have \nbeen breeding fruit-flies for sixty years or more in labs all round the \nworld- flies which produce a new generation every eleven days-they have \nnever yet seen the emergence of a new species or even a new enzyme.21\n\nAnother researcher, Michael Pitman, comments on the failure of the \nexperiments carried out on fruit flies:\n\nMorgan, Goldschmidt, Muller, and other geneticists have subjected \ngenerations of fruit flies to extreme conditions of heat, cold, light, \ndark, and treatment by chemicals and radiation. All sorts of mutations, \npractically all trivial or positively deleterious, have been produced. \nMan-made evolution? Not really: Few of the geneticists' monsters could have \nsurvived outside the bottles they were bred in. In practice mutants die, \nare sterile, or tend to revert to the wild type.22\n\nThe same holds true for man. All mutations that have been observed in human \nbeings have had deleterious results. All mutations that take place in \nhumans result in physical deformities, in infirmities such as mongolism, \nDown syndrome, albinism, dwarfism or cancer. Needless to say, a process \nthat leaves people disabled or sick cannot be \"an evolutionary \nmechanism\"-evolution is supposed to produce forms that are better fitted to \nsurvive.\n\nThe American pathologist David A. Demick notes the following in a \nscientific article about mutations:\n\nLiterally thousands of human diseases associated with genetic mutations \nhave been catalogued in recent years, with more being described \ncontinually. A recent reference book of medical genetics listed some 4,500 \ndifferent genetic diseases. Some of the inherited syndromes characterized \nclinically in the days before molecular genetic analysis (such as Marfan's \nsyndrome) are now being shown to be heterogeneous; that is, associated with \nmany different mutations... With this array of human diseases that are \ncaused by mutations, what of positive effects? With thousands of examples \nof harmful mutations readily available, surely it should be possible to \ndescribe some positive mutations if macroevolution is true. These would be \nneeded not only for evolution to greater complexity, but also to offset the \ndownward pull of the many harmful mutations. But, when it comes to \nidentifying positive mutations, evolutionary scientists are strangely \nsilent.23\n\nThe only instance evolutionary biologists give of \"useful mutation\" is the \ndisease known as sickle cell anemia. In this, the hemoglobin molecule, \nwhich serves to carry oxygen in the blood, is damaged as a result of \nmutation, and undergoes a structural change. As a result of this, the \nhemoglobin molecule's ability to carry oxygen is seriously impaired. People \nwith sickle cell anemia suffer increasing respiratory difficulties for this \nreason. However, this example of mutation, which is discussed under blood \ndisorders in medical textbooks, is strangely evaluated by some evolutionary \nbiologists as a \"useful mutation.\"\n\nThey say that the partial immunity to malaria by those with the illness is \na \"gift\" of evolution. Using the same logic, one could say that, since \npeople born with genetic leg paralysis are unable to walk and so are saved \nfrom being killed in traffic accidents, therefore genetic leg paralysis is \na \"useful genetic feature.\" This logic is clearly totally unfounded.\n\nIt is obvious that mutations are solely a destructive mechanism. \nPierre-Paul Grass\u00e9, former president of the French Academy of Sciences, is \nquite clear on this point in a comment he made about mutations. Grass\u00e9 \ncompared mutations to \"making mistakes in the letters when copying a \nwritten text.\" And as with mutations, letter mistakes cannot give rise to \nany information, but merely damage such information as already exists. \nGrass\u00e9 explained this fact in this way:\n\nMutations, in time, occur incoherently. They are not complementary to one \nanother, nor are they cumulative in successive generations toward a given \ndirection. They modify what preexists, but they do so in disorder, no \nmatter how\u2026. As soon as some disorder, even slight, appears in an organized \nbeing, sickness, then death follow. There is no possible compromise between \nthe phenomenon of life and anarchy.24\nSo for that reason, as Grass\u00e9 puts it, \"No matter how numerous they may be, \nmutations do not produce any kind of evolution.\"25\n\n\n\nThe Pleiotropic Effect\nThe most important proof that mutations lead only to damage, is the process \nof genetic coding. Almost all of the genes in a fully developed living \nthing carry more than one piece of information. For instance, one gene may \ncontrol both the height and the eye color of that organism. Microbiologist \nMichael Denton explains this characteristic of genes in higher organisms \nsuch as human beings, in this way:\n\nThe effects of genes on development are often surprisingly diverse. In the \nhouse mouse, nearly every coat-colour gene has some effect on body size. \nOut of seventeen x-ray induced eye colour mutations in the fruit fly \nDrosophila melanogaster, fourteen affected the shape of the sex organs of \nthe female, a characteristic that one would have thought was quite \nunrelated to eye colour. Almost every gene that has been studied in higher \norganisms has been found to effect more than one organ system, a multiple \neffect which is known as pleiotropy. As Mayr argues in Population, Species \nand Evolution: \"It is doubtful whether any genes that are not pleiotropic \nexist in higher organisms.\"26\n\nBecause of this characteristic of the genetic structure of living things, \nany coincidental change because of a mutation, in any gene in the DNA, will \naffect more than one organ. Consequently, this mutation will not be \nrestricted to one part of the body, but will reveal more of its destructive \nimpact. Even if one of these impacts turns out to be beneficial, as a \nresult of a very rare coincidence, the unavoidable effects of the other \ndamage it causes will more than outweigh those benefits.\n\nTo summarize, there are three main reasons why mutations cannot make \nevolution possible:\n\nl- The direct effect of mutations is harmful: Since they occur randomly, \nthey almost always damage the living organism that undergoes them. Reason \ntells us that unconscious intervention in a perfect and complex structure \nwill not improve that structure, but will rather impair it. Indeed, no \n\"useful mutation\" has ever been observed.\n\n2- Mutations add no new information to an organism's DNA: The particles \nmaking up the genetic information are either torn from their places, \ndestroyed, or carried off to different places. Mutations cannot make a \nliving thing acquire a new organ or a new trait. They only cause \nabnormalities like a leg sticking out of the back, or an ear from the \nabdomen.\n\n3- In order for a mutation to be transferred to the subsequent generation, \nit has to have taken place in the reproductive cells of the organism: A \nrandom change that occurs in a cell or organ of the body cannot be \ntransferred to the next generation. For example, a human eye altered by the \neffects of radiation, or by other causes, will not be passed on to \nsubsequent generations.\n\nAll the explanations provided above indicate that natural selection and \nmutation have no evolutionary effect at all. So far, no observable example \nof \"evolution\" has been obtained by this method. Sometimes, evolutionary \nbiologists claim that \"they cannot observe the evolutionary effect of \nnatural selection and mutation mechanisms since these mechanisms take place \nonly over an extended period of time.\" However, this argument, which is \njust a way of making themselves feel better, is baseless, in the sense that \nit lacks any scientific foundation. During his lifetime, a scientist can \nobserve thousands of generations of living things with short life spans \nsuch as fruit flies or bacteria, and still observe no \"evolution.\" \nPierre-Paul Grass\u00e9 states the following about the unchanging nature of \nbacteria, a fact which invalidates evolution:\n\nBacteria ...are the organisms which, because of their huge numbers, produce \nthe most mutants. acteria ...exhibit a great fidelity to their species. The \nbacillus Escherichia coli, whose mutants have been studied very carefully, \nis the best example. The reader will agree that it is surprising, to say \nthe least, to want to prove evolution and to discover its mechanisms and \nthen to choose as a material for this study a being which practically \nstabilized a billion years ago! What is the use of their unceasing \nmutations, if they do not [produce evolutionary] change? In sum, the \nmutations of bacteria and viruses are merely hereditary fluctuations around \na median position; a swing to the right, a swing to the left, but no final \nevolutionary effect. Cockroaches, which are one of the most venerable \nliving insect groups, have remained more or less unchanged since the \nPermian, yet they have undergone as many mutations as Drosophila, a \nTertiary insect. 27\n\nBriefly, it is impossible for living beings to have evolved, because there \nexists no mechanism in nature that can cause evolution. Furthermore, this \nconclusion agrees with the evidence of the fossil record, which does not \ndemonstrate the existence of a process of evolution, but rather just the \ncontrary.\n7 Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, The \nModern Library, New York, p. 127.

            "text": "Natural selection produces nothing new. NOTHING!!. It cannot be used to \nexplain how creatures came into being from other creatures.\n\nThe concept of natural selection was the basis of Darwinism. This assertion \nis stressed even in the title of the book in which Darwin proposed his \ntheory: The Origin of Species, by means of Natural Selection\u2026\n\nNatural selection is based on the assumption that in nature there is a \nconstant struggle for survival. It favors organisms with traits that best \nenable them to cope with pressures exerted by the environment. At the end \nof this struggle, the strongest ones, the ones most suited to natural \nconditions, survive. For example, in a herd of deer under threat from \npredators, those individuals that can run fastest will naturally survive. \nAs a consequence, the herd of deer will eventually consist of only \nfast-running individuals.\n\nHowever, no matter how long this process goes on, it will not transform \nthose deer into another species. The weak deer are eliminated, the strong \nsurvive, but, since no alteration in their genetic data takes place, no \ntransformation of a species occurs. Despite the continuous processes of \nselection, deer continue to exist as deer.\n\nThe deer example is true for all species. In any population, natural \nselection only eliminates those weak, or unsuited individuals who are \nunable to adapt to the natural conditions in their habitat. It does not \nproduce new species, new genetic information, or new organs. That is, it \ncannot cause anything to evolve. Darwin, too, accepted this fact, stating \nthat \"Natural selection can do nothing until favourable individual \ndifferences or variations occur.\"7 That is why neo-Darwinism had to add the \nmutation mechanism as a factor altering genetic information to the concept \nof natural selection.\n\nWe will deal with mutations next. But before proceeding, we need to further \nexamine the concept of natural selection in order to see the contradictions \ninherent in it.\n\n\nThe essential assumption of the theory of natural selection holds that \nthere is a fierce struggle for survival in nature, and every living thing \ncares only for itself. At the time Darwin proposed this theory, the ideas \nof Thomas Malthus, the British classical economist, were an important \ninfluence on him. Malthus maintained that human beings were inevitably in a \nconstant struggle for survival, basing his views on the fact that \npopulation, and hence the need for food resources, increases geometrically, \nwhile food resources themselves increase only arithmetically. The result is \nthat population size is inevitably checked by factors in the environment, \nsuch as hunger and disease. Darwin adapted Malthus's vision of a fierce \nstruggle for survival among human beings to nature at large, and claimed \nthat \"natural selection\" is a consequence of this struggle.\n\nFurther research, however, revealed that there was no struggle for life in \nnature as Darwin had postulated. As a result of extensive research into \nanimal groups in the 1960s and 1970s, V. C. Wynne-Edwards, a British \nzoologist, concluded that living things balance their population in an \ninteresting way, which prevents competition for food. Animal groups were \nsimply managing their population on the basis of their food resources. \nPopulation was regulated not by elimination of the weak through factors \nlike epidemics or starvation, but by instinctive control mechanisms. In \nother words, animals controlled their numbers not by fierce competition, as \nDarwin suggested, but by limiting reproduction.8\n\nEven plants exhibited examples of population control, which invalidated \nDarwin's suggestion of selection by means of competition. The botanist A. \nD. Bradshaw's observations indicated that during reproduction, plants \nbehaved according to the \"density\" of the planting, and limited their \nreproduction if the area was highly populated with plants.9 On the other \nhand, examples of sacrifice observed in animals such as ants and bees \ndisplay a model completely opposed to the Darwinist struggle for survival.\n\nIn recent years, research has revealed findings regarding self-sacrifice \neven in bacteria. These living things without brains or nervous systems, \ntotally devoid of any capacity for thought, kill themselves to save other \nbacteria when they are invaded by viruses.10\n\nThese examples surely invalidate the basic assumption of natural \nselection-the absolute struggle for survival. It is true that there is \ncompetition in nature; however, there are clear models of self-sacrifice \nand solidarity, as well.\n\n\nApart from the theoretical weaknesses mentioned above, the theory of \nevolution by natural selection comes up against a fundamental impasse when \nfaced with concrete scientific findings. The scientific value of a theory \nmust be assessed according to its success or failure in experiment and \nobservation. Evolution by natural selection fails on both counts.\n\nSince Darwin's time, there has not been a single shred of evidence put \nforward to show that natural selection causes living things to evolve. \nColin Patterson, the senior paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural \nHistory in London and a prominent evolutionist, stresses that natural \nselection has never been observed to have the ability to cause things to \nevolve:\n\nNo one has ever produced a species by the mechanisms of natural selection. \nNo one has ever got near it, and most of the current argument in \nneo-Darwinism is about this question.11\n\nPierre-Paul Grass\u00e9, a well-known French zoologist and critic of Darwinism, \nhas these words to say in \"Evolution and Natural Selection,\" a chapter of \nhis book The Evolution of Living Organisms.\n\nThe \"evolution in action\" of J. Huxley and other biologists is simply the \nobservation of demographic facts, local fluctuations of genotypes, \ngeographical distributions. Often the species concerned have remained \npractically unchanged for hundreds of centuries! Fluctuation as a result of \ncircumstances, with prior modification of the genome, does not imply \nevolution, and we have tangible proof of this in many panchronic species \n[i.e. living fossils that remain unchanged for millions of years].12\n\nA close look at a few \"observed examples of natural selection\" presented by \nbiologists who advocate the theory of evolution, would reveal that, in \nreality, they do not provide any evidence for evolution.\n\n\n\nThe True Story Of The Industrial Melanism\n\nWhen evolutionist sources are examined, one inevitably sees that the \nexample of moths in England during the Industrial Revolution is cited as an \nexample of evolution by natural selection. This is put forward as the most \nconcrete example of evolution observed, in textbooks, magazines, and even \nacademic sources. In actuality, though, that example has nothing to do with \nevolution at all.\n\nLet us first recall what is actually said: According to this account, \naround the onset of the Industrial Revolution in England, the color of tree \nbarks around Manchester was quite light. Because of this, dark-colored \nmoths resting on those trees could easily be noticed by the birds that fed \non them, and therefore they had very little chance of survival. Fifty years \nlater, in woodlands where industrial pollution has killed the lichens, the \nbark of the trees had darkened, and now the light-colored moths became the \nmost hunted, since they were the most easily noticed. As a result, the \nproportion of light-colored to dark-colored moths decreased. Evolutionists \nbelieve this to be a great piece of evidence for their theory. They take \nrefuge and solace in window-dressing, showing how light-colored moths \n\"evolved\" into dark-colored ones.\n\n\nHowever, although we believe these facts to be correct, it should be quite \nclear that they can in no way be used as evidence for the theory of \nevolution, since no new form arose that had not existed before. Dark \ncolored moths had existed in the moth population before the Industrial \nRevolution. Only the relative proportions of the existing moth varieties in \nthe population changed. The moths had not acquired a new trait or organ, \nwhich would cause \"speciation.\"13 In order for one moth species to turn \ninto another living species, a bird for example, new additions would have \nhad to be made to its genes. That is, an entirely separate genetic program \nwould have had to be loaded so as to include information about the physical \ntraits of the bird.\n\nThis is the answer to be given to the evolutionist story of Industrial \nMelanism. However, there is a more interesting side to the story: Not just \nits interpretation, but the story itself is flawed. As molecular biologist \nJonathan Wells explains in his book Icons of Evolution, the story of the \npeppered moths, which is included in every evolutionary biology book and \nhas therefore, become an \"icon\" in this sense, does not reflect the truth. \nWells discusses in his book how Bernard Kettlewell's experiment, which is \nknown as the \"experimental proof\" of the story, is actually a scientific \nscandal. Some basic elements of this scandal are:\n\n- Many experiments conducted after Kettlewell's revealed that only one type \nof these moths rested on tree trunks, and all other types preferred to rest \nbeneath small, horizontal branches. Since 1980 it has become clear that \npeppered moths do not normally rest on tree trunks. In 25 years of \nfieldwork, many scientists such as Cyril Clarke and Rory Howlett, Michael \nMajerus, Tony Liebert, and Paul Brakefield concluded that in Kettlewell's \nexperiment, moths were forced to act atypically, therefore, the test \nresults could not be accepted as scientific.14\n\n- Scientists who tested Kettlewell's conclusions came up with an even more \ninteresting result: Although the number of light moths would be expected to \nbe larger in the less polluted regions of England, the dark moths there \nnumbered four times as many as the light ones. This meant that there was no \ncorrelation between the moth population and the tree trunks as claimed by \nKettlewell and repeated by almost all evolutionist sources.\n\n- As the research deepened, the scandal changed dimension: \"The moths on \ntree trunks\" photographed by Kettlewell, were actually dead moths. \nKettlewell used dead specimens glued or pinned to tree trunks and then \nphotographed them. In truth, there was little chance of taking such a \npicture as the moths rested not on tree trunks but underneath the leaves.15\n\nThese facts were uncovered by the scientific community only in the late \n1990s. The collapse of the myth of Industrial Melanism, which had been one \nof the most treasured subjects in \"Introduction to Evolution\" courses in \nuniversities for decades, greatly disappointed evolutionists. One of them, \nJerry Coyne, remarked:\n\nMy own reaction resembles the dismay attending my discovery, at the age of \nsix, that it was my father and not Santa who brought the presents on \nChristmas Eve.16\n\nThus, \"the most famous example of natural selection\" was relegated to the \ntrash-heap of history as a scientific scandal-which was inevitable, because \nnatural selection is not an \"evolutionary mechanism,\" contrary to what \nevolutionists claim.\n\nIn short, natural selection is capable neither of adding a new organ to a \nliving organism, nor of removing one, nor of changing an organism of one \nspecies into that of another. The \"greatest\" evidence put forward since \nDarwin has been able to go no further than the \"industrial melanism\" of \nmoths in England.\n\n\nWhy Natural Selection Can Not Explain Complexity?\n\nAs we showed at the beginning, the greatest problem for the theory of \nevolution by natural selection, is that it cannot enable new organs or \ntraits to emerge in living things. Natural selection cannot develop a \nspecies' genetic data; therefore, it cannot be used to account for the \nemergence of new species. The greatest defender of the theory of punctuated \nequilibrium, Stephen Jay Gould, refers to this impasse of natural selection \nas follows;\n\nThe essence of Darwinism lies in a single phrase: natural selection is the \ncreative force of evolutionary change. No one denies that selection will \nplay a negative role in eliminating the unfit. Darwinian theories require \nthat it create the fit as well.17\n\nAnother of the misleading methods that evolutionists employ on the issue of \nnatural selection is their effort to present this mechanism as an \nintelligent designer. However,natural selection has no intelligence. It \ndoes not possess a will that can decide what is good and what is bad for \nliving things. As a result, natural selection cannot explain biological \nsystems and organs that possess the feature of \"irreducible complexity\". \nThese systems and organs are composed of a great number of parts \ncooperating together, and are of no use if even one of these parts is \nmissing or defective. (For example, the human eye does not function unless \nit exists with all its components intact).\n\nTherefore, the will that brings all these parts together should be able to \nforesee the future and aim directly at the advantage that is to be acquired \nat the final stage. Since natural selection has no consciousness or will, \nit can do no such thing. This fact, which demolishes the foundations of the \ntheory of evolution, also worried Darwin, who wrote: \"If it could be \ndemonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have \nbeen formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would \nabsolutely break down.\"18\n\n\nMutations\n\nMutations are defined as breaks or replacements taking place in the DNA \nmolecule, which is found in the nuclei of the cells of a living organism \nand which contains all its genetic information. These breaks or \nreplacements are the result of external effects such as radiation or \nchemical action. Every mutation is an \"accident,\" and either damages the \nnucleotides making up the DNA or changes their locations. Most of the time, \nthey cause so much damage and modification that the cell cannot repair them.\n\nMutation, which evolutionists frequently hide behind, is not a magic wand \nthat transforms living organisms into a more advanced and perfect form. The \ndirect effect of mutations is harmful. The changes effected by mutations \ncan only be like those experienced by people in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and \nChernobyl: that is, death, disability, and freaks of nature\u2026\n\nThe reason for this is very simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and \nrandom effects can only damage it. Biologist B. G. Ranganathan states:\n\nFirst, genuine mutations are very rare in nature. Secondly, most mutations \nare harmful since they are random, rather than orderly changes in the \nstructure of genes; any random change in a highly ordered system will be \nfor the worse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to \nshake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be a \nrandom change in the framework of the building, which, in all probability, \nwould not be an improvement.19\n\nNot surprisingly, no useful mutation has been so far observed. All \nmutations have proved to be harmful. The evolutionist scientist Warren \nWeaver comments on the report prepared by the Committee on Genetic Effects \nof Atomic Radiation, which had been formed to investigate mutations that \nmight have been caused by the nuclear weapons used in the Second World War:\n\nMany will be puzzled about the statement that practically all known mutant \ngenes are harmful. For mutations are a necessary part of the process of \nevolution. How can a good effect-evolution to higher forms of life-result \nfrom mutations practically all of which are harmful?20\n\nEvery effort put into \"generating a useful mutation\" has resulted in \nfailure. For decades, evolutionists carried out many experiments to produce \nmutations in fruit flies, as these insects reproduce very rapidly and so \nmutations would show up quickly. Generation upon generation of these flies \nwere mutated, yet no useful mutation was ever observed. The evolutionist \ngeneticist Gordon Taylor writes thus:\n\nIt is a striking, but not much mentioned fact that, though geneticists have \nbeen breeding fruit-flies for sixty years or more in labs all round the \nworld- flies which produce a new generation every eleven days-they have \nnever yet seen the emergence of a new species or even a new enzyme.21\n\nAnother researcher, Michael Pitman, comments on the failure of the \nexperiments carried out on fruit flies:\n\nMorgan, Goldschmidt, Muller, and other geneticists have subjected \ngenerations of fruit flies to extreme conditions of heat, cold, light, \ndark, and treatment by chemicals and radiation. All sorts of mutations, \npractically all trivial or positively deleterious, have been produced. \nMan-made evolution? Not really: Few of the geneticists' monsters could have \nsurvived outside the bottles they were bred in. In practice mutants die, \nare sterile, or tend to revert to the wild type.22\n\nThe same holds true for man. All mutations that have been observed in human \nbeings have had deleterious results. All mutations that take place in \nhumans result in physical deformities, in infirmities such as mongolism, \nDown syndrome, albinism, dwarfism or cancer. Needless to say, a process \nthat leaves people disabled or sick cannot be \"an evolutionary \nmechanism\"-evolution is supposed to produce forms that are better fitted to \nsurvive.\n\nThe American pathologist David A. Demick notes the following in a \nscientific article about mutations:\n\nLiterally thousands of human diseases associated with genetic mutations \nhave been catalogued in recent years, with more being described \ncontinually. A recent reference book of medical genetics listed some 4,500 \ndifferent genetic diseases. Some of the inherited syndromes characterized \nclinically in the days before molecular genetic analysis (such as Marfan's \nsyndrome) are now being shown to be heterogeneous; that is, associated with \nmany different mutations... With this array of human diseases that are \ncaused by mutations, what of positive effects? With thousands of examples \nof harmful mutations readily available, surely it should be possible to \ndescribe some positive mutations if macroevolution is true. These would be \nneeded not only for evolution to greater complexity, but also to offset the \ndownward pull of the many harmful mutations. But, when it comes to \nidentifying positive mutations, evolutionary scientists are strangely \nsilent.23\n\nThe only instance evolutionary biologists give of \"useful mutation\" is the \ndisease known as sickle cell anemia. In this, the hemoglobin molecule, \nwhich serves to carry oxygen in the blood, is damaged as a result of \nmutation, and undergoes a structural change. As a result of this, the \nhemoglobin molecule's ability to carry oxygen is seriously impaired. People \nwith sickle cell anemia suffer increasing respiratory difficulties for this \nreason. However, this example of mutation, which is discussed under blood \ndisorders in medical textbooks, is strangely evaluated by some evolutionary \nbiologists as a \"useful mutation.\"\n\nThey say that the partial immunity to malaria by those with the illness is \na \"gift\" of evolution. Using the same logic, one could say that, since \npeople born with genetic leg paralysis are unable to walk and so are saved \nfrom being killed in traffic accidents, therefore genetic leg paralysis is \na \"useful genetic feature.\" This logic is clearly totally unfounded.\n\nIt is obvious that mutations are solely a destructive mechanism. \nPierre-Paul Grass\u00e9, former president of the French Academy of Sciences, is \nquite clear on this point in a comment he made about mutations. Grass\u00e9 \ncompared mutations to \"making mistakes in the letters when copying a \nwritten text.\" And as with mutations, letter mistakes cannot give rise to \nany information, but merely damage such information as already exists. \nGrass\u00e9 explained this fact in this way:\n\nMutations, in time, occur incoherently. They are not complementary to one \nanother, nor are they cumulative in successive generations toward a given \ndirection. They modify what preexists, but they do so in disorder, no \nmatter how\u2026. As soon as some disorder, even slight, appears in an organized \nbeing, sickness, then death follow. There is no possible compromise between \nthe phenomenon of life and anarchy.24\n\nSo for that reason, as Grass\u00e9 puts it, \"No matter how numerous they may be, \nmutations do not produce any kind of evolution.\"25\n\n\n\nThe Pleiotropic Effect\n\nThe most important proof that mutations lead only to damage, is the process \nof genetic coding. Almost all of the genes in a fully developed living \nthing carry more than one piece of information. For instance, one gene may \ncontrol both the height and the eye color of that organism. Microbiologist \nMichael Denton explains this characteristic of genes in higher organisms \nsuch as human beings, in this way:\n\nThe effects of genes on development are often surprisingly diverse. In the \nhouse mouse, nearly every coat-colour gene has some effect on body size. \nOut of seventeen x-ray induced eye colour mutations in the fruit fly \nDrosophila melanogaster, fourteen affected the shape of the sex organs of \nthe female, a characteristic that one would have thought was quite \nunrelated to eye colour. Almost every gene that has been studied in higher \norganisms has been found to effect more than one organ system, a multiple \neffect which is known as pleiotropy. As Mayr argues in Population, Species \nand Evolution: \"It is doubtful whether any genes that are not pleiotropic \nexist in higher organisms.\"26\n\nBecause of this characteristic of the genetic structure of living things, \nany coincidental change because of a mutation, in any gene in the DNA, will \naffect more than one organ. Consequently, this mutation will not be \nrestricted to one part of the body, but will reveal more of its destructive \nimpact. Even if one of these impacts turns out to be beneficial, as a \nresult of a very rare coincidence, the unavoidable effects of the other \ndamage it causes will more than outweigh those benefits.\n\nTo summarize, there are three main reasons why mutations cannot make \nevolution possible:\n\nl- The direct effect of mutations is harmful: Since they occur randomly, \nthey almost always damage the living organism that undergoes them. Reason \ntells us that unconscious intervention in a perfect and complex structure \nwill not improve that structure, but will rather impair it. Indeed, no \n\"useful mutation\" has ever been observed.\n\n2- Mutations add no new information to an organism's DNA: The particles \nmaking up the genetic information are either torn from their places, \ndestroyed, or carried off to different places. Mutations cannot make a \nliving thing acquire a new organ or a new trait. They only cause \nabnormalities like a leg sticking out of the back, or an ear from the \nabdomen.\n\n3- In order for a mutation to be transferred to the subsequent generation, \nit has to have taken place in the reproductive cells of the organism: A \nrandom change that occurs in a cell or organ of the body cannot be \ntransferred to the next generation. For example, a human eye altered by the \neffects of radiation, or by other causes, will not be passed on to \nsubsequent generations.\n\n\nAll the explanations provided above indicate that natural selection and \nmutation have no evolutionary effect at all. So far, no observable example \nof \"evolution\" has been obtained by this method. Sometimes, evolutionary \nbiologists claim that \"they cannot observe the evolutionary effect of \nnatural selection and mutation mechanisms since these mechanisms take place \nonly over an extended period of time.\" However, this argument, which is \njust a way of making themselves feel better, is baseless, in the sense that \nit lacks any scientific foundation. During his lifetime, a scientist can \nobserve thousands of generations of living things with short life spans \nsuch as fruit flies or bacteria, and still observe no \"evolution.\" \nPierre-Paul Grass\u00e9 states the following about the unchanging nature of \nbacteria, a fact which invalidates evolution:\n\nBacteria ...are the organisms which, because of their huge numbers, produce \nthe most mutants. acteria ...exhibit a great fidelity to their species. The \nbacillus Escherichia coli, whose mutants have been studied very carefully, \nis the best example. The reader will agree that it is surprising, to say \nthe least, to want to prove evolution and to discover its mechanisms and \nthen to choose as a material for this study a being which practically \nstabilized a billion years ago! What is the use of their unceasing \nmutations, if they do not [produce evolutionary] change? In sum, the \nmutations of bacteria and viruses are merely hereditary fluctuations around \na median position; a swing to the right, a swing to the left, but no final \nevolutionary effect. Cockroaches, which are one of the most venerable \nliving insect groups, have remained more or less unchanged since the \nPermian, yet they have undergone as many mutations as Drosophila, a \nTertiary insect. 27\n\nBriefly, it is impossible for living beings to have evolved, because there \nexists no mechanism in nature that can cause evolution. Furthermore, this \nconclusion agrees with the evidence of the fossil record, which does not \ndemonstrate the existence of a process of evolution, but rather just the \ncontrary.\n7 Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, The \nModern Library, New York, p. 127.

            "text": "Natural selection produces nothing new. NOTHING!!. It cannot be used to \nexplain how creatures came into being from other creatures.\n\nThe concept of natural selection was the basis of Darwinism. This assertion \nis stressed even in the title of the book in which Darwin proposed his \ntheory: The Origin of Species, by means of Natural Selection\u2026\n\nNatural selection is based on the assumption that in nature there is a \nconstant struggle for survival. It favors organisms with traits that best \nenable them to cope with pressures exerted by the environment. At the end \nof this struggle, the strongest ones, the ones most suited to natural \nconditions, survive. For example, in a herd of deer under threat from \npredators, those individuals that can run fastest will naturally survive. \nAs a consequence, the herd of deer will eventually consist of only \nfast-running individuals.\n\nHowever, no matter how long this process goes on, it will not transform \nthose deer into another species. The weak deer are eliminated, the strong \nsurvive, but, since no alteration in their genetic data takes place, no \ntransformation of a species occurs. Despite the continuous processes of \nselection, deer continue to exist as deer.\n\nThe deer example is true for all species. In any population, natural \nselection only eliminates those weak, or unsuited individuals who are \nunable to adapt to the natural conditions in their habitat. It does not \nproduce new species, new genetic information, or new organs. That is, it \ncannot cause anything to evolve. Darwin, too, accepted this fact, stating \nthat \"Natural selection can do nothing until favourable individual \ndifferences or variations occur.\"7 That is why neo-Darwinism had to add the \nmutation mechanism as a factor altering genetic information to the concept \nof natural selection.\n\nWe will deal with mutations next. But before proceeding, we need to further \nexamine the concept of natural selection in order to see the contradictions \ninherent in it.\n\n\nThe essential assumption of the theory of natural selection holds that \nthere is a fierce struggle for survival in nature, and every living thing \ncares only for itself. At the time Darwin proposed this theory, the ideas \nof Thomas Malthus, the British classical economist, were an important \ninfluence on him. Malthus maintained that human beings were inevitably in a \nconstant struggle for survival, basing his views on the fact that \npopulation, and hence the need for food resources, increases geometrically, \nwhile food resources themselves increase only arithmetically. The result is \nthat population size is inevitably checked by factors in the environment, \nsuch as hunger and disease. Darwin adapted Malthus's vision of a fierce \nstruggle for survival among human beings to nature at large, and claimed \nthat \"natural selection\" is a consequence of this struggle.\n\nFurther research, however, revealed that there was no struggle for life in \nnature as Darwin had postulated. As a result of extensive research into \nanimal groups in the 1960s and 1970s, V. C. Wynne-Edwards, a British \nzoologist, concluded that living things balance their population in an \ninteresting way, which prevents competition for food. Animal groups were \nsimply managing their population on the basis of their food resources. \nPopulation was regulated not by elimination of the weak through factors \nlike epidemics or starvation, but by instinctive control mechanisms. In \nother words, animals controlled their numbers not by fierce competition, as \nDarwin suggested, but by limiting reproduction.8\n\nEven plants exhibited examples of population control, which invalidated \nDarwin's suggestion of selection by means of competition. The botanist A. \nD. Bradshaw's observations indicated that during reproduction, plants \nbehaved according to the \"density\" of the planting, and limited their \nreproduction if the area was highly populated with plants.9 On the other \nhand, examples of sacrifice observed in animals such as ants and bees \ndisplay a model completely opposed to the Darwinist struggle for survival.\n\nIn recent years, research has revealed findings regarding self-sacrifice \neven in bacteria. These living things without brains or nervous systems, \ntotally devoid of any capacity for thought, kill themselves to save other \nbacteria when they are invaded by viruses.10\n\nThese examples surely invalidate the basic assumption of natural \nselection-the absolute struggle for survival. It is true that there is \ncompetition in nature; however, there are clear models of self-sacrifice \nand solidarity, as well.\n\n\nApart from the theoretical weaknesses mentioned above, the theory of \nevolution by natural selection comes up against a fundamental impasse when \nfaced with concrete scientific findings. The scientific value of a theory \nmust be assessed according to its success or failure in experiment and \nobservation. Evolution by natural selection fails on both counts.\n\nSince Darwin's time, there has not been a single shred of evidence put \nforward to show that natural selection causes living things to evolve. \nColin Patterson, the senior paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural \nHistory in London and a prominent evolutionist, stresses that natural \nselection has never been observed to have the ability to cause things to \nevolve:\n\nNo one has ever produced a species by the mechanisms of natural selection. \nNo one has ever got near it, and most of the current argument in \nneo-Darwinism is about this question.11\n\nPierre-Paul Grass\u00e9, a well-known French zoologist and critic of Darwinism, \nhas these words to say in \"Evolution and Natural Selection,\" a chapter of \nhis book The Evolution of Living Organisms.\n\nThe \"evolution in action\" of J. Huxley and other biologists is simply the \nobservation of demographic facts, local fluctuations of genotypes, \ngeographical distributions. Often the species concerned have remained \npractically unchanged for hundreds of centuries! Fluctuation as a result of \ncircumstances, with prior modification of the genome, does not imply \nevolution, and we have tangible proof of this in many panchronic species \n[i.e. living fossils that remain unchanged for millions of years].12\n\nA close look at a few \"observed examples of natural selection\" presented by \nbiologists who advocate the theory of evolution, would reveal that, in \nreality, they do not provide any evidence for evolution.\n\n\n\nThe True Story Of The Industrial Melanism\n\nWhen evolutionist sources are examined, one inevitably sees that the \nexample of moths in England during the Industrial Revolution is cited as an \nexample of evolution by natural selection. This is put forward as the most \nconcrete example of evolution observed, in textbooks, magazines, and even \nacademic sources. In actuality, though, that example has nothing to do with \nevolution at all.\n\nLet us first recall what is actually said: According to this account, \naround the onset of the Industrial Revolution in England, the color of tree \nbarks around Manchester was quite light. Because of this, dark-colored \nmoths resting on those trees could easily be noticed by the birds that fed \non them, and therefore they had very little chance of survival. Fifty years \nlater, in woodlands where industrial pollution has killed the lichens, the \nbark of the trees had darkened, and now the light-colored moths became the \nmost hunted, since they were the most easily noticed. As a result, the \nproportion of light-colored to dark-colored moths decreased. Evolutionists \nbelieve this to be a great piece of evidence for their theory. They take \nrefuge and solace in window-dressing, showing how light-colored moths \n\"evolved\" into dark-colored ones.\n\n\nHowever, although we believe these facts to be correct, it should be quite \nclear that they can in no way be used as evidence for the theory of \nevolution, since no new form arose that had not existed before. Dark \ncolored moths had existed in the moth population before the Industrial \nRevolution. Only the relative proportions of the existing moth varieties in \nthe population changed. The moths had not acquired a new trait or organ, \nwhich would cause \"speciation.\"13 In order for one moth species to turn \ninto another living species, a bird for example, new additions would have \nhad to be made to its genes. That is, an entirely separate genetic program \nwould have had to be loaded so as to include information about the physical \ntraits of the bird.\n\nThis is the answer to be given to the evolutionist story of Industrial \nMelanism. However, there is a more interesting side to the story: Not just \nits interpretation, but the story itself is flawed. As molecular biologist \nJonathan Wells explains in his book Icons of Evolution, the story of the \npeppered moths, which is included in every evolutionary biology book and \nhas therefore, become an \"icon\" in this sense, does not reflect the truth. \nWells discusses in his book how Bernard Kettlewell's experiment, which is \nknown as the \"experimental proof\" of the story, is actually a scientific \nscandal. Some basic elements of this scandal are:\n\n- Many experiments conducted after Kettlewell's revealed that only one type \nof these moths rested on tree trunks, and all other types preferred to rest \nbeneath small, horizontal branches. Since 1980 it has become clear that \npeppered moths do not normally rest on tree trunks. In 25 years of \nfieldwork, many scientists such as Cyril Clarke and Rory Howlett, Michael \nMajerus, Tony Liebert, and Paul Brakefield concluded that in Kettlewell's \nexperiment, moths were forced to act atypically, therefore, the test \nresults could not be accepted as scientific.14\n\n- Scientists who tested Kettlewell's conclusions came up with an even more \ninteresting result: Although the number of light moths would be expected to \nbe larger in the less polluted regions of England, the dark moths there \nnumbered four times as many as the light ones. This meant that there was no \ncorrelation between the moth population and the tree trunks as claimed by \nKettlewell and repeated by almost all evolutionist sources.\n\n- As the research deepened, the scandal changed dimension: \"The moths on \ntree trunks\" photographed by Kettlewell, were actually dead moths. \nKettlewell used dead specimens glued or pinned to tree trunks and then \nphotographed them. In truth, there was little chance of taking such a \npicture as the moths rested not on tree trunks but underneath the leaves.15\n\nThese facts were uncovered by the scientific community only in the late \n1990s. The collapse of the myth of Industrial Melanism, which had been one \nof the most treasured subjects in \"Introduction to Evolution\" courses in \nuniversities for decades, greatly disappointed evolutionists. One of them, \nJerry Coyne, remarked:\n\nMy own reaction resembles the dismay attending my discovery, at the age of \nsix, that it was my father and not Santa who brought the presents on \nChristmas Eve.16\n\nThus, \"the most famous example of natural selection\" was relegated to the \ntrash-heap of history as a scientific scandal-which was inevitable, because \nnatural selection is not an \"evolutionary mechanism,\" contrary to what \nevolutionists claim.\n\nIn short, natural selection is capable neither of adding a new organ to a \nliving organism, nor of removing one, nor of changing an organism of one \nspecies into that of another. The \"greatest\" evidence put forward since \nDarwin has been able to go no further than the \"industrial melanism\" of \nmoths in England.\n\n\nWhy Natural Selection Can Not Explain Complexity?\n\nAs we showed at the beginning, the greatest problem for the theory of \nevolution by natural selection, is that it cannot enable new organs or \ntraits to emerge in living things. Natural selection cannot develop a \nspecies' genetic data; therefore, it cannot be used to account for the \nemergence of new species. The greatest defender of the theory of punctuated \nequilibrium, Stephen Jay Gould, refers to this impasse of natural selection \nas follows;\n\nThe essence of Darwinism lies in a single phrase: natural selection is the \ncreative force of evolutionary change. No one denies that selection will \nplay a negative role in eliminating the unfit. Darwinian theories require \nthat it create the fit as well.17\n\nAnother of the misleading methods that evolutionists employ on the issue of \nnatural selection is their effort to present this mechanism as an \nintelligent designer. However,natural selection has no intelligence. It \ndoes not possess a will that can decide what is good and what is bad for \nliving things. As a result, natural selection cannot explain biological \nsystems and organs that possess the feature of \"irreducible complexity\". \nThese systems and organs are composed of a great number of parts \ncooperating together, and are of no use if even one of these parts is \nmissing or defective. (For example, the human eye does not function unless \nit exists with all its components intact).\n\nTherefore, the will that brings all these parts together should be able to \nforesee the future and aim directly at the advantage that is to be acquired \nat the final stage. Since natural selection has no consciousness or will, \nit can do no such thing. This fact, which demolishes the foundations of the \ntheory of evolution, also worried Darwin, who wrote: \"If it could be \ndemonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have \nbeen formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would \nabsolutely break down.\"18\n\n\nMutations\n\nMutations are defined as breaks or replacements taking place in the DNA \nmolecule, which is found in the nuclei of the cells of a living organism \nand which contains all its genetic information. These breaks or \nreplacements are the result of external effects such as radiation or \nchemical action. Every mutation is an \"accident,\" and either damages the \nnucleotides making up the DNA or changes their locations. Most of the time, \nthey cause so much damage and modification that the cell cannot repair them.\n\nMutation, which evolutionists frequently hide behind, is not a magic wand \nthat transforms living organisms into a more advanced and perfect form. The \ndirect effect of mutations is harmful. The changes effected by mutations \ncan only be like those experienced by people in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and \nChernobyl: that is, death, disability, and freaks of nature\u2026\n\nThe reason for this is very simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and \nrandom effects can only damage it. Biologist B. G. Ranganathan states:\n\nFirst, genuine mutations are very rare in nature. Secondly, most mutations \nare harmful since they are random, rather than orderly changes in the \nstructure of genes; any random change in a highly ordered system will be \nfor the worse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to \nshake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be a \nrandom change in the framework of the building, which, in all probability, \nwould not be an improvement.19\n\nNot surprisingly, no useful mutation has been so far observed. All \nmutations have proved to be harmful. The evolutionist scientist Warren \nWeaver comments on the report prepared by the Committee on Genetic Effects \nof Atomic Radiation, which had been formed to investigate mutations that \nmight have been caused by the nuclear weapons used in the Second World War:\n\nMany will be puzzled about the statement that practically all known mutant \ngenes are harmful. For mutations are a necessary part of the process of \nevolution. How can a good effect-evolution to higher forms of life-result \nfrom mutations practically all of which are harmful?20\n\nEvery effort put into \"generating a useful mutation\" has resulted in \nfailure. For decades, evolutionists carried out many experiments to produce \nmutations in fruit flies, as these insects reproduce very rapidly and so \nmutations would show up quickly. Generation upon generation of these flies \nwere mutated, yet no useful mutation was ever observed. The evolutionist \ngeneticist Gordon Taylor writes thus:\n\nIt is a striking, but not much mentioned fact that, though geneticists have \nbeen breeding fruit-flies for sixty years or more in labs all round the \nworld- flies which produce a new generation every eleven days-they have \nnever yet seen the emergence of a new species or even a new enzyme.21\n\nAnother researcher, Michael Pitman, comments on the failure of the \nexperiments carried out on fruit flies:\n\nMorgan, Goldschmidt, Muller, and other geneticists have subjected \ngenerations of fruit flies to extreme conditions of heat, cold, light, \ndark, and treatment by chemicals and radiation. All sorts of mutations, \npractically all trivial or positively deleterious, have been produced. \nMan-made evolution? Not really: Few of the geneticists' monsters could have \nsurvived outside the bottles they were bred in. In practice mutants die, \nare sterile, or tend to revert to the wild type.22\n\nThe same holds true for man. All mutations that have been observed in human \nbeings have had deleterious results. All mutations that take place in \nhumans result in physical deformities, in infirmities such as mongolism, \nDown syndrome, albinism, dwarfism or cancer. Needless to say, a process \nthat leaves people disabled or sick cannot be \"an evolutionary \nmechanism\"-evolution is supposed to produce forms that are better fitted to \nsurvive.\n\nThe American pathologist David A. Demick notes the following in a \nscientific article about mutations:\n\nLiterally thousands of human diseases associated with genetic mutations \nhave been catalogued in recent years, with more being described \ncontinually. A recent reference book of medical genetics listed some 4,500 \ndifferent genetic diseases. Some of the inherited syndromes characterized \nclinically in the days before molecular genetic analysis (such as Marfan's \nsyndrome) are now being shown to be heterogeneous; that is, associated with \nmany different mutations... With this array of human diseases that are \ncaused by mutations, what of positive effects? With thousands of examples \nof harmful mutations readily available, surely it should be possible to \ndescribe some positive mutations if macroevolution is true. These would be \nneeded not only for evolution to greater complexity, but also to offset the \ndownward pull of the many harmful mutations. But, when it comes to \nidentifying positive mutations, evolutionary scientists are strangely \nsilent.23\n\nThe only instance evolutionary biologists give of \"useful mutation\" is the \ndisease known as sickle cell anemia. In this, the hemoglobin molecule, \nwhich serves to carry oxygen in the blood, is damaged as a result of \nmutation, and undergoes a structural change. As a result of this, the \nhemoglobin molecule's ability to carry oxygen is seriously impaired. People \nwith sickle cell anemia suffer increasing respiratory difficulties for this \nreason. However, this example of mutation, which is discussed under blood \ndisorders in medical textbooks, is strangely evaluated by some evolutionary \nbiologists as a \"useful mutation.\"\n\nThey say that the partial immunity to malaria by those with the illness is \na \"gift\" of evolution. Using the same logic, one could say that, since \npeople born with genetic leg paralysis are unable to walk and so are saved \nfrom being killed in traffic accidents, therefore genetic leg paralysis is \na \"useful genetic feature.\" This logic is clearly totally unfounded.\n\nIt is obvious that mutations are solely a destructive mechanism. \nPierre-Paul Grass\u00e9, former president of the French Academy of Sciences, is \nquite clear on this point in a comment he made about mutations. Grass\u00e9 \ncompared mutations to \"making mistakes in the letters when copying a \nwritten text.\" And as with mutations, letter mistakes cannot give rise to \nany information, but merely damage such information as already exists. \nGrass\u00e9 explained this fact in this way:\n\nMutations, in time, occur incoherently. They are not complementary to one \nanother, nor are they cumulative in successive generations toward a given \ndirection. They modify what preexists, but they do so in disorder, no \nmatter how\u2026. As soon as some disorder, even slight, appears in an organized \nbeing, sickness, then death follow. There is no possible compromise between \nthe phenomenon of life and anarchy.24\n\nSo for that reason, as Grass\u00e9 puts it, \"No matter how numerous they may be, \nmutations do not produce any kind of evolution.\"25\n\n\n\nThe Pleiotropic Effect\n\nThe most important proof that mutations lead only to damage, is the process \nof genetic coding. Almost all of the genes in a fully developed living \nthing carry more than one piece of information. For instance, one gene may \ncontrol both the height and the eye color of that organism. Microbiologist \nMichael Denton explains this characteristic of genes in higher organisms \nsuch as human beings, in this way:\n\nThe effects of genes on development are often surprisingly diverse. In the \nhouse mouse, nearly every coat-colour gene has some effect on body size. \nOut of seventeen x-ray induced eye colour mutations in the fruit fly \nDrosophila melanogaster, fourteen affected the shape of the sex organs of \nthe female, a characteristic that one would have thought was quite \nunrelated to eye colour. Almost every gene that has been studied in higher \norganisms has been found to effect more than one organ system, a multiple \neffect which is known as pleiotropy. As Mayr argues in Population, Species \nand Evolution: \"It is doubtful whether any genes that are not pleiotropic \nexist in higher organisms.\"26\n\nBecause of this characteristic of the genetic structure of living things, \nany coincidental change because of a mutation, in any gene in the DNA, will \naffect more than one organ. Consequently, this mutation will not be \nrestricted to one part of the body, but will reveal more of its destructive \nimpact. Even if one of these impacts turns out to be beneficial, as a \nresult of a very rare coincidence, the unavoidable effects of the other \ndamage it causes will more than outweigh those benefits.\n\nTo summarize, there are three main reasons why mutations cannot make \nevolution possible:\n\nl- The direct effect of mutations is harmful: Since they occur randomly, \nthey almost always damage the living organism that undergoes them. Reason \ntells us that unconscious intervention in a perfect and complex structure \nwill not improve that structure, but will rather impair it. Indeed, no \n\"useful mutation\" has ever been observed.\n\n2- Mutations add no new information to an organism's DNA: The particles \nmaking up the genetic information are either torn from their places, \ndestroyed, or carried off to different places. Mutations cannot make a \nliving thing acquire a new organ or a new trait. They only cause \nabnormalities like a leg sticking out of the back, or an ear from the \nabdomen.\n\n3- In order for a mutation to be transferred to the subsequent generation, \nit has to have taken place in the reproductive cells of the organism: A \nrandom change that occurs in a cell or organ of the body cannot be \ntransferred to the next generation. For example, a human eye altered by the \neffects of radiation, or by other causes, will not be passed on to \nsubsequent generations.\n\n\nAll the explanations provided above indicate that natural selection and \nmutation have no evolutionary effect at all. So far, no observable example \nof \"evolution\" has been obtained by this method. Sometimes, evolutionary \nbiologists claim that \"they cannot observe the evolutionary effect of \nnatural selection and mutation mechanisms since these mechanisms take place \nonly over an extended period of time.\" However, this argument, which is \njust a way of making themselves feel better, is baseless, in the sense that \nit lacks any scientific foundation. During his lifetime, a scientist can \nobserve thousands of generations of living things with short life spans \nsuch as fruit flies or bacteria, and still observe no \"evolution.\" \nPierre-Paul Grass\u00e9 states the following about the unchanging nature of \nbacteria, a fact which invalidates evolution:\n\nBacteria ...are the organisms which, because of their huge numbers, produce \nthe most mutants. acteria ...exhibit a great fidelity to their species. The \nbacillus Escherichia coli, whose mutants have been studied very carefully, \nis the best example. The reader will agree that it is surprising, to say \nthe least, to want to prove evolution and to discover its mechanisms and \nthen to choose as a material for this study a being which practically \nstabilized a billion years ago! What is the use of their unceasing \nmutations, if they do not [produce evolutionary] change? In sum, the \nmutations of bacteria and viruses are merely hereditary fluctuations around \na median position; a swing to the right, a swing to the left, but no final \nevolutionary effect. Cockroaches, which are one of the most venerable \nliving insect groups, have remained more or less unchanged since the \nPermian, yet they have undergone as many mutations as Drosophila, a \nTertiary insect. 27\n\nBriefly, it is impossible for living beings to have evolved, because there \nexists no mechanism in nature that can cause evolution. Furthermore, this \nconclusion agrees with the evidence of the fossil record, which does not \ndemonstrate the existence of a process of evolution, but rather just the \ncontrary.\n7 Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, The \nModern Library, New York, p. 127.
