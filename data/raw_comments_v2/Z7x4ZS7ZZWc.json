As soon as some one says something you \nnarrow-minded people do not agree with, you start with tired and tiresome \nanalogy of \"Communism\" etc. etc. Not that it makes any  difference since I \nam sure you will never concede that you have learned something new but I \ncould not end my comment without informing you that there are ONLY five \ncountries that are officially called a Communist country: China, Cuba, \nLaos, North Korea and Vietnam and I am not even sure about a couple of \nthem. There are 196 countries in the world, Five countries out of 96 is \nabout 2.5% which is hardly \"Plenty of Communist countries\". If math is not \nyour strong skill, let me explain to in a way so you can understand. 3.5% \nof Federal tax goes toward education and of that 1 penny goes to sciences. \nNo wonder you think 5 countries is plenty or maybe you did not even know \nthat there are only 5 countries that are Communists. Canada, Sweden, \nFrance, UK, and Italy are among countries which offer universal health care \nto their citizens. They are also all \"Free market\", \"Capitalists\" and \n\"Democratic\" Western countries, allies of the United States and most of \nthem are NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) members (except Sweden) \nand if you do not know what NATO is Google it. No Communist country is a \nmember of NATO!\nAll these above mentioned countries spend less on health care than the U.S. \nand deliver health care to EVERY CITIZEN!\nOne last thing, Google the term \"Godwin's Rule of Nazi Analogies\" which \nstates that in any discussion of controversial subject, sooner or later \nsomebody will make the comparison to Hitler and Nazism. Now, I would like \nto coin the term of \"OwlsEyelash Rule of Communism Analogies\". Sooner or \nlater, some uninformed individual compares Universal Healthcare to \nCommunism! FALLACY! That is what it is. Read a bit, you will be a much \nbetter debater. Good day!",

There are a lot of things to criticize Obama \nfor, like Benghazi, NSA overreach, refusing to enforce existing immigration \nlaw, and lying to the American people over and over again about the \ndisaster of a health care law (which should NOT be a communist single-payer \nsystem. If you want that, there are plenty of communist countries you can \nmove to that offer it).
