Historically, the name refers \nto the Bavarian Illuminati, an Enlightenment-era secret society founded on \nMay 1, 1776. The society's goals were to oppose superstition, obscurantism, \nreligious influence over public life and abuses of state power. \"The order \nof the day,\" they wrote in their general statutes, \"is to put an end to the \nmachinations of the purveyors of injustice, to control them without \ndominating them.\"[1] The Illuminati\u2014along with Freemasonry and other secret \nsocieties\u2014were outlawed through Edict, by the Bavarian ruler, Charles \nTheodore, with the encouragement of the Roman Catholic Church, in 1784, \n1785, 1787 and 1790.[2] In the several years following, the group was \nvilified by conservative and religious critics who claimed that they \ncontinued underground and were responsible for the French Revolution.\n",
