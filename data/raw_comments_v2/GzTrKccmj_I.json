The war indirectly led to our acquisition of Alaska.  \nDuring the war, the Union navy was occupied with blockading the Southern \nports, which left the Eastern coast open to potential attack by Britain.  \nSo the Union sought aid from an unlikely source: Tsar Alexander II (who was \nan admirer of Lincoln, by the way).  So Alexander sent the imperial Russian \nnavy to safeguard the U.S. coast.  But when the war was over, the Tsar \nwanted to be reimbursed for the cost.  But it would not have gone over well \nwith the public to learn that the Union, presumably fighting for such \nthings as freedom and democracy, was being assisted by the supreme \nautocrat, \"Tsar of All the Russias.\"  So a deal was worked out.  Russia \npossessed Alaska.  It was a financial drain, and they wanted to get rid of \nit.  So we bought it, in 1867.  The deal was named \"Seward's Folly,\" after \nthe Secretary of State.  Of course, 25 years later, gold was discovered in \nAlaska, and I'm sure the Russians were kicking themselves for having given \nit up.  This comes from, \"The Unseen Hand,\" by Ralph Epperson.\ufeff",

            "text": "+RonPaulHatesBlacks Maybe it wasn't the majority, my apologies. I found a \nfew things that might help.\n\nThe view that America's apparently intractable racial problem should be \nsolved by removing blacks from this country and resettling them elsewhere \n-- \"colonization\" or \"repatriation\" -- was not a new one. As early as 1714 \na New Jersey man proposed sending blacks to Africa. In 1777 a Virginia \nlegislature committee, headed by future President Thomas Jefferson (himself \na major slave owner), proposed a plan of gradual emancipation and \nresettlement of the state's slaves. In 1815, an enterprising free black \nfrom Massachusetts named Paul Cuffe transported, at his own expense, 38 \nfree blacks to West Africa. His undertaking showed that at least some free \nblacks were eager to resettle in a country of their own, and suggested what \nmight be possible with public and even government support.7\nIn December 1816, a group of distinguished Americans met in Washington, DC, \nto establish an organization to promote the cause of black resettlement. \nThe \"American Colonization Society\" soon won backing from some of the young \nnation's most prominent citizens. Henry Clay, Francis Scott Key, John \nRandolph, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, Bushrod \nWashington, Charles Carroll, Millard Fillmore, John Marshall, Roger B. \nTaney, Andrew Jackson, Daniel Webster, Stephen A. Douglas, and Abraham \nLincoln were members. Clay presided at the group's first meeting.8\nMeasures to resettle blacks in Africa were soon undertaken. Society member \nCharles Fenton Mercer played an important role in getting Congress to pass \nthe Anti-Slave Trading Act of March 1819, which appropriated $100,000 to \ntransport blacks to Africa. In enforcing the Act, Mercer suggested to \nPresident James Monroe that if blacks were simply returned to the coast of \nAfrica and released, they would probably be re-enslaved, and possibly some \nreturned to the United States. Accordingly, and in cooperation with the \nSociety, Monroe sent agents to acquire territory on Africa's West coast -- \na step that led to the founding of the country now known as Liberia. Its \ncapital city was named Monrovia in honor of the American President.9\nWith crucial Society backing, black settlers began arriving from the United \nStates in 1822. While only free blacks were at first brought over, after \n1827, slaves were freed expressly for the purpose of transporting them to \nLiberia. In 1847, black settlers declared Liberia an independent republic, \nwith an American-style flag and constitution.10\nBy 1832 the legislatures of more than a dozen states (at that time there \nwere only 24), had given official approval to the Society, including at \nleast three slave-holding states.11 Indiana's legislature, for example, \npassed the following joint resolution on January 16, 1850:12\nBe it resolved by the General Assembly of the State of Indiana: That our \nSenators and Representatives in Congress be, and they are hereby requested, \nin the name of the State of Indiana, to call for a change of national \npolicy on the subject of the African Slave Trade, and that they require a \nsettlement of the coast of Africa with colored men from the United States, \nand procure such changes in our relations with England as will permit us to \ntransport colored men from this country to Africa, with whom to effect said \nsettlement.\nIn January 1858, Missouri Congressman Francis P. Blair, Jr., introduced a \nresolution in the House of Representatives to set up a committee\nto inquire into the expediency of providing for the acquisition of \nterritory either in the Central or South American states, to be colonized \nwith colored persons from the United States who are now free, or who may \nhereafter become free, and who may be willing to settle in such territory \nas a dependency of the United States, with ample guarantees of their \npersonal and political rights.\nBlair, quoting Thomas Jefferson, stated that blacks could never be accepted \nas the equals of whites, and, consequently, urged support for a dual policy \nof emancipation and deportation, similar to Spain's expulsion of the Moors. \nBlair went on to argue that the territory acquired for the purpose would \nalso serve as a bulwark against any further encroachment by England in the \nCentral and South American regions.\n\nhttp://www.ihr.org/jhr/v13/v13n5p-4_Morgan.html\n\nhttp://www.loc.gov/exhibits/african/afam002.html\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Colonization_Society",
