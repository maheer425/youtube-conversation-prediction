We didnt have any so I just \nwent on a limb and followed the recipe, but without the baking powder. also \na beater is not necessary. i tried my best to whisk the spread and eggs \ntogether the best i could. I just gave up when it was all lumpy and added \nin the sugar. it all came together in a fluffy mix after i whisked in the \nsugar. sadly i left the cookies in the oven to long and burnt the bottom of \nthe cookies. but the top half of the cookies were tremendous!!!! i didnt do \nthe decoration though; i just wanted some plain cookies. but ro, this is a \ngreat recipe and so yummy. thanks for posting!!!! oxo\n \ufeff",
