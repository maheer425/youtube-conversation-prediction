Regarding \"nerd girls are the world's greatest \nunderutilized romantic resource\", have in mind this is coming from a \nnovelist. Female protagonists are rarely depicted as intelligent in \nromantic books. Quirky, cool, troubled and beautiful seem to be the most \ncommon tributes. \n\nAbout, \"malnourished [,,,] and plastic bags needlessly inserted into \nbreasts\"; John is talking about an odd social construct. He is referencing \nthe unattainable expectations men have for women's bodies due to the media. \nTo put it simply, he's talking about the Barbie body issue. Unrealistic yet \naccepted as a standard for beauty in society. He isn't saying he likes \nBarbie's looks or dislikes them. He's merely recognizing the social \nconstruct's existence.\ufeff",

Which was fairly easy, because he has \ntattoos and is naturally intimidating and broad shouldered. But, when I \nwent to his place, and saw his fairly large collection of Star Trek \npictures, some of them signed, I was like \"...This is another side to a \nperson that I have never known, and I kind of like it.\"\nAs long as you're not afraid to be yourself (which is hard, granted, but \ndoable), you will find someone who is fantastically into all that you're \ninto. Or at least accepts it. For instance, I'm not a grand fan of \nHighlander, but I did decide to have the first name of our first born son \nConnor as in Connor McLeod from the clan McLeod. And then my husband \ndecided to appeal to my punk/superstitious love and his middle name became \nDice (which is a sticker on my bass, that I'm not sure he knew about or \nnot). He also deals with my love of Anime, Invader Zim and Tank Girl. And \nmusic, so much music. \nMEETING IN THE MIDDLE! It's ... really all that marriage is, in so many \nmany many ways. :3 \ufeff",

And therefore, I am trying to find ways to make him like me, \ntoo... He doesn't seem to dislike me. He blushes if we glance each other at \nthe same time and talks to me a bit and doesn't move away, if I sit next to \nhim. But he doesn't ask me any of my online nicknames so he could friend me \nnor my phone number, nor does he suggest that we'd meet, if there is no \napparent reason. He did hang out here in me and my bf's apartment a couple \nof times, when my bf's computer was broken and he was fixing it... After \nthat it's always been me asking my bf asking him if we can hang out.\nI don't know how to approach him.. I often give people the wrong idea about \nmy feelings and intentions and then they think I like them as something \nmore than friends. I usually start liking a person as a friend quite soon, \nthen I tell them they're nice and that I like them as a person/friend, and \nthen they usually tell me I'm weird. If they're as weird as me, we usually \nend up being friends. I have made friends the usual way, too. Random \ntalking, that slowly grows deeper and so on. But I find my way much \nquicker, if you really like someone. I really don't want him to get the \nwrong idea. He is my bf's friend, therefore I would never hit on him, not \neven if me and my bf broke up.\nAnyway. I find him as a true nerd. He likes computers, anime, swords, video \ngames and board games, at least. I find him a bit scary, because they're \nknown for about 10 years and me and my bf have known for about 3, he is 4 \nyears older than me, has more common interests with my bf than me and I've \nonly known him for about a month. My bf is something a bit alike. He likes \nanime and video games and Lord of the Rings, Star Trek, Star Wars, Harry \nPotter.\nI like Harry Potter a lot and I love theater, but I really really love and \nknow pretty much everything about rock and metal music. I have seen some \nanime series and movies. I like movies a lot, except for action. Horror, \nthriller, drama, comedy, it all goes. I only play Sims 2 and some \noccasional online mini games, but I know a lot about games and I can follow \na conversation very well about the subject. I like board games, except \nchess. The Big Bang Theory is my favorite tv show. I'm just getting into \nall of this \"nerd stuff\", I'm almost 23. My bf and his friend are almost 27.\nSorry this got so long and rambling, but does anyone have any advice for me \non how to friend this guy?\ufeff",

One because every new invention or discovery is usually based \non someone eles' work and two because The fault in our stars is in the \nromantic genre which is defiantly a genre which has repeatably been used. \nMost could name 20-25 romantic books. Also John Green learnt everything he \nknows from other people, writers, teachers, philosophers. So any thought he \nmay come up with, is all based on any knowledge, morals and experiences he \nhas had. This really can be said for everyone the difference is John Green \napplied it. I am not stating that The fault in our stars is not a good book \nbut I do not think that your last statement was well thought through. If \nyou ask any older family members to read The fault in our stars I am sure \nthey could come up with a list of references and other which is somehow \nsimilar from something they read/watched as a child. A good example is The \nperks of being a wallflower which i find to be a rip off of Adrian Mole, \nwhich i read when I was eight years old. One statement of your comment i \ncan agree with though is the quotes. John Green's sentence structure is \nvery advanced and fluent, which is a very difficult task. Finding your \nwriting style and making sure it flows has taken me about 5 years. I hope \nyou found this interesting. Yours, A Secret Fangirl.",

I just took their word for it, and \nbecame severely depressed, purposely destroying my body, cause I thought \n\"Well, it's not like I could get any worse\". I even feared mirrors, because \nI thought if I looked, I'd see something akin to a monster. Then one day I \nthought \"Might as well. It's not like I could look any worse than I imagine \nI do\", and examined my features. Shocked as I was, I wasn't half bad. \nActually decided I was cute, aside from the signs that I had given up on \ntaking care of myself. Once I realized they were just pathetic idiots, \nwhose opinions didn't hold water, I started taking care of myself FOR \nmyself, and natural confidence soon followed.
