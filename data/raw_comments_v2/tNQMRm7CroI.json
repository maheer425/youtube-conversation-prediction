Almost nothing happens \nunless they are already airborne or you fire it at their feet. Even then \nthe actual impact force is slim to nothing. This would imply the rockets \nare actually smaller than the average projectile of the rocket launcher in \nthe video. Allowing the soldier's handy dandy explosive pogo to launch him \nwithout any immense self damage. In this case what is the actual damage of \nthe rocket launcher cause by? The explosive force is low and would more \nlikely take a body part off than kill someone. The more relevant answer is \nthe rockets material. The rocket on impact may be built to intentionally \nshatter which would cause millions of pieces of shrapnel to fly away from \nthe impact zone. Acting like miniature bullets all hitting one or more \ntargets in an instance is effective and cheap. More evidence is the Gun \nBoats, those metal boots would not stop an explosion however they would \nblock shrapnel from hitting the soldiers feet and cause bleeding which is \nwhy the soldier takes less damage from Rocket Jumping. Continuing with the \nexplosive force, how does the soldier actually launch himself? Especially \nwith the small explosive force, the answer is simple. Whenever the soldier \nwants to rocket jump, he jumps in the air correct? Well there is your \nanswer... The rocket has almost no force but with the added strength of a \nMilitary soldier who rocket jumps for a living gives him the much needed \nheight. Working as a \"team\" the soldier and his explosive pogo stick can \njump to the skies and be with the Sreamin' Eagle like this american always \nwanted to be.\ufeff",
