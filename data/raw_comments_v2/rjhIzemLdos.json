Any true historian \nknows about the lies the British Empire spread about Spain, most people \ndon't even know about the existence of the \"Black Legend\". The Spanish \ndollar was the most valued and stable currency in the world, it was also \nthe most commonly used coin in trade. The Spanish dollar was widely used by \nmany countries as international currency because of its uniformity in \nstandard and milling characteristics. Some countries countersigned the \nSpanish dollar so it could be used as their local currency.The Spanish \ndollar was the coin upon which the original United States dollar was based. \nBecause it was widely used in Europe, the Americas, and the Far East, it \nbecame the first world currency by the late 18th century. Aside from the \nU.S. dollar, several other existing currencies, such as the Canadian \ndollar, the Japanese yen, the Chinese yuan, the Philippine peso, and \nseveral currencies were initially based on the Spanish dollar. \nSpain didn't have colonies, they had vice-royalties, which means that \nMexico, Peru, etc. had the same rights as the people in Spain, no other \nnation or Kingdom in the world ever did anything similar, Spaniards gave \nthe \"new world\", a language, Greek philosophy, superior technology etc. \nSpain built over 25 Universities in America, how many did the French, \nBritish and Portuguese built at that time in their colonies?\nIndigenous people never asked for Independence, they were happy with being \npart of the Kingdom of Spain, the people who instigated the revolutions \nagainst the Spanish Kingdom were all funded by the British Elite, this is \ncommon knowledge among historians (some of them British Historians), Simon \nBolivar was a free-mason and a lackey of the British Monarchy. The Spanish \nEmpire was once the most powerful in the world now it is divided into \nlittle third-world countries that have unpayable external debts. It's sad \nhow little people in Latin-American countries know about their own history, \nI've traveled to South America 5 times already and most people have no idea \nabout it.\nAll of what I've stated has been documented and I have the sources to prove \nit. People who want to know more and beginners should read the book \n\"Iberia\" by James Michener and V\u00e4rldshistoria (Universal History) by Carl \nGrimberg.\nThe USA only exists because of Spain, Spain owned Alabama, Florida, Texas, \netc. this would take a long time to explain, but how many people know that \nin 1777, Benjamin Franklin, American representative in France, called for \nthe aid of Spain obtaining by this means 215 bronze cannons, tents, \ngrenades, 30,000 muskets, bayonets and uniforms, musket balls and 300,000 \npounds of powder. Franklin, thankful for it, wrote a letter to the Count of \nAranda appreciating all the help, and subsequently received over 12,000 \nmuskets, sent to Boston from Spain. In addition, Spain gave him almost \n2,000,000 silver pesos.\n\n\n\"Americans great inadequacies is lack of knowledge of the whole SPANISH \ninfluence, Exploration, contribution and development of U.S. History \nstarting in the 1500's,which is a tremendous story!\" President John F. \nKennedy\n\"Oldest history of the U.S. is written in Spanish.\" Thomas Jefferson\n\nWhat once was the most prosperous Empire of the world is now divided into \nlittle countries with external debts that can never be paid. The same goes \nfor the US, once we were the greatest country of the world, a country built \nby immigrants, the US is now about to crumble, ever since 1914 all of the \nmoney in the US has been created and issued by an illegal method that will \neventually destroy this country. Did any of you guys know about the \nexternal debt of the US: 17,997,889,181,468.20 US dollars. Only a fool will \nrefuse to see the truth. Cui bono \"to whose benefit?\ufeff",

He joined the wise men of this century and made them think about \nit: as a result, the first human rights were born (\"derecho de gentes\", as \nJames Brown Scott said: \"I, James Brow Scott, anglosazon and protestant, \ndeclare fray Francisco of Vitoria, spanish, catholic and dominic monk, as \nthe true founder of the modern school of International Law\").\n\n-The first 8-hours work day was first enjoyed by native miners in Am\u00e9rica, \nas a law made by Philippe II, king of Spain, in the XVI century.\n\n-In percentage, died more spanish due to hard acclimatation and strange \nillness in Am\u00e9rica (50%) than native american due to european flu (20-30%). \n- Spanish colonies had democratic representation in Spanish Cortes \n(parliament), not as english ones.\n\n- Spanish inquisition could not judge native americans (nor pagans it was \nnot made for that neither catholics -they considered them as new faith men, \nwith more rights than peninsular spanish-). - Encomienda (social system of \nwork distribution), was made with some mistakes at first, but it ended \nbeing far softer than the analog sytem in Europe.\n\nI could keep going, but I preffer to recommend some GOOD history authors \nfor being read by interested ones: Philip W.

Society is heavy \nmilitarized and religious.\n\n- The *SAME* year in which the war ends, America is discovered. Religious \nand military leaders are sent abroad. They find pagans cutting out hearts \nof other conquered tribes. I mean, what do you expect will happen? These \nare people who have been warring all their life, for dozens of generations, \nand are as Christian as you can get.\n\n- Goal: Liberate conquered tribes, destroy pagans, work the mines. They do \nit. The Queen passes a law that forbids from enslaving the natives and \ntells to treat them as Spanish, as long as they convert. 80% of the \ngovernors in the Americas ignore this. A few governors get caught, \narrested, and put to death (Colombus being a prime example; he wasn't put \nto death because of his services to the crown, but he was arrested and \nstripped of his titles and riches).\n\n- The general tone, however, is that common people marry and have children \nwith the natives, and it is common for the natives to marry a Spaniard to \nrise in the social scale. Once a native becomes Christian and learns \nSpanish, he/she is considered Spanish.\n\n- Some viceroys and nobles choose to obey the Crown fully, and black slaves \nare brought from Africa, since Native Americans are Spanish and can't be \nenslaved (Rennaissance logic, not much to say about that, but hey, our \nactual colonies weren't that bad). This is not common, though (as evidenced \nby the fact that there are not so many blacks in central and South America, \nespecially if you compare with the English Caribbean colonies, which are \nalmost fully populated by blacks).\n\n- The Spanish proceed to wipe their asses with Europe, with their \nnewly-acquired riches and millitary tradition of great generals, \n\"centuries-at-war\" hardened soldiers, and powerful tactics, very advanced \nfor their time.\n\n- Eventually, after 200 years, the Empire starts its decadence. Bitter, \nbutthurt enemies create the \"Black Legend\", an old \"Internet meme\" of some \nsorts about our country being evil in its purest form.\n\n- Their Empires fight wars against ours. Thousands of our American natives \nfight on the side of Spain to avoid being conquered by the British (I \nwonder why, since we were so terrible, right?). The British proceed to \nobliterate the North American indians, among other things, but in the end \nthey write history.\n\nNowadays:\n- General opinion: Spanish Empire, bad bad bad. British Empire, good good \ngood.\n- South American natives alive today (speaking spanish): 200 million, most \nof them mixed, with Spanish ancestry.\n- North American natives alive today: 3 million, in reservations.\n\nI rest my case.
