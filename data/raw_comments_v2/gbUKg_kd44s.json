I smoked a decent amount of weed throughout high \nschool, stopped almost entirely for two years, then one day decided to \nsmoke a joint with my brother because why the fuck not, he said it was \nawesome shit. A couple of minutes after we smoked it the high started to \nkick in and I thought it was pretty awesome... then I walked into the \nkitchen to grab some water and that's when shit hit the fan - BAD. I fell \nto the ground and my heart started pounding at a million miles a minute. \nAfter laying down on the floor for a bit I said to myself \"I can't let \nanyone see me like this\" so I used all my strength to get up and lay in \ndown.\n\nThe next two hours would be the longest hours of my life as I ACTUALLY \nthought I was going to die. My heart was pounding, I was breathing very \nintensely, I couldn't form a sentence (was mumbling to myself pretty much \nthe entire time), I felt extreme paranoia and anxiety, shaking, sweating, \netc. Tried to throw on some headphones to pass the time but the second they \nstarted playing my head felt like it was going to explode, so I chucked \nthem across the room without hesitation. And when the high/trip was finally \nover, I sat there for about 20 minutes in complete shock about what just \nhappened, and said to myself I would never touch that shit again. A year \nand a half later, I haven't touched weed again.\n\nI know I didn't green out because I wasn't seeing doubles or having spins \nand I didn't feel like puking once, it was just... I don't know, one of the \nworst trips of my life. I've done a fair mount of other shit like M, K, \nblow, percocets, and shrooms and I swear man, never experienced anything \nlike I did that night.\ufeff",
