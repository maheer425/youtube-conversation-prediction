She is not alone in this distinction, but her \nsituation is extremely abnormal. \n\nSince the job openings for these or similar jobs are so few in comparison \nto even qualified applicants, you can rarely even actually apply for them. \n Hence my sarcastic reply to your implication that the only factor \npreventing anyone from having an equally awesome job is that they hadn't \napplied for one yet.  \n\nMy \"bullshit government job\" isn't actually bad at all, it just is in \nCOMPARISON to getting paid to drive around on the Nurburgring.  It's not \nspecifically enjoyable, so much as it is tolerable while paying well enough \nto do actually enjoyable things outside of work.  I'll assume by your \nprofile picture that you are a car guy, and I don't need to explain this \nconcept further.  While I freely admit that I am lazy, my self-esteem \ndoesn't factor in to it.\n\nYou are technically correct though, there's nothing actually preventing me \nfrom applying for these jobs when they are posted, I'd just have to do so \nwith the understanding that I wouldn't be successful in obtaining one. \n There are a lot of",
