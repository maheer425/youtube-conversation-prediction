However, it is also blighted by understeer, torque steer (even with \nQuattro, it has that much torque) and a chassis that cannot handle the \npower. Sometimes I felt more like a passenger than a driver. The gearbox is \nalso rather notchy (the designers had problems finding one that would fit \nand still handle the torque) and the clutch is heavy.\nThe B7 feels very different. The engine needs to be worked hard to get the \nmost out of it but will pull rapidly all the way to 8,500 RPM. The gearbox \nis slick and the clutch light. The chassis is a delight, beautifully \nbalanced, turns in well and inspires confidence. Very stable at high speed, \nit never loses its composure. Responsive steering with a lot of feel and \nfeedback. This is a car that could handle a lot more power than it has.\nSo there you have it; the B5 is an uncouth brute that lives on the ragged \nedge; the B7 smooth, sophisticated and hugely capable.
