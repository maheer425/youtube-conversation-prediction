            "text": "\"Back then when you where hungry, chasing down fruites and vegetables was \nless energy consuming\" The veggie part is wrong, because veggies suck for \nenergy. Cows themselves prove that you need a costly fermentation complex \njust to turn cellulose into fat. Ruminants ain't even true herbivores, they \nabsorb bacterial matter. That's the reason why Homo Erectus decided to \nincinerate them; he was able to extract more resources stored by them \n(ergo, allowing him to afford a more energy hungry brain).",
