Rolling 5-60 mph: 5.1 sec. If you do some math, you'll see \nthat 0-5 mph takes .3 tenths, so that M235's 0-60 is around 4.8, not 4.3 or \n4.4 sec. 20hp and 17 tq is not going to cut/drop 0-60 times 3/4 of a sec. \nNever. I'm seeing lots of problems with the 8 spd too. Why can't just one \nManu stick with what is proven and works instead of trying to best everyone \nelse with firsts. Nobody cars about firsts. Please. 7 spd DCT needs to come \nback, steering feel needs to come back. It's sad that BMW's in general, \nhave become very disconnected to the road and driving experience which is \nwhat earned them the \"Ultimate Driving Machine\" monkier. These days it's \nthe \"Ultimate Computer controlled Machine\" video game manufacturer. BMW \nyour losing tens of thousands of faithful clients every month. That would \nother me. \ufeff",

I have concluded that my car ( hence, the \n235, is most and foremost totally enjoyable in only 2 situations: on open \nhighways and a race track, the latter of which I've never been on. In my \ncar, the comfort mode barely gets by on city or suburban town, everyday \nroads. The steering tightens up splendidly in sport mode, but the \nsuspension is less enjoyable and a bit jittery much of the time. I realize \nNOW, that this track handling suspension, on balance is to firm for me and \nless \"gliding or supple\" on regular roads. I try to remember my test of the \nbase 228; I found it made me want to make the plunge for this car... Mind \nyou, i wnt to feel the road and have tight hefty steering, but my track \npackage (suspension or large tires) is a bit too much! I lower tire peas \nurge a bit and feel a bit better on city or town driving. Nonetheless , the \nbase 228 might have been a better choice. Needless to say, all reviewers \nlove the m235 suspension in all areas of driving road conditions. I guess I \nneed a TOUCH less road feel or a touch more absorption of road cracks and \nnooks for everyday driving. \nIn the other hand, the car accelerates wonderfully and is still fun to \ndrive in the BMW tradition. On the other hand..... Maybe I am a Mercedes \n(sport suspension) man at heart!!!\nWTF... The new c class will be thought of in near future with its varying \noptions. By the way, a brief drive of the latest 3 series gave me the \nsuspension and steering I need: but the extra 2 doors I don't!\n\ufeff",
