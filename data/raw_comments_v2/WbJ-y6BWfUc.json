ALL it needs \nto do is counter the effects in the vicinity of the ship (which is, by \ndesign, what it already does).\n\nit's all about relatives, so the warp drive doesn't need to COUNTER the \nblack hole's pull to escape, all it needs to do is create a warp bubble \n(meaning the gravity can no longer affect the ship in the first place \nanyway since the warp bubble essentially cuts it off from the black hole's \ninfluence), and expand space time behind it, and compress space time in \nfront of it. this propels the spacecraft.\n\nso, whatever the warp drive has to do, it will simply add on to the \nconditions already around the bubble. if space time is already compressed \nin front of the ship, it will simply compress it further. if space time is \nalready compressed behind the ship, it will still expand it. maybe not to \nthe same degree as it would outside the event horizon, but then, it doesn't \nhave to, ANY expansion or compression in these conditions will still propel \nthe ship.\n\nyou keep thinking of this like a ship fighting a current. if the current is \nstrong enough, no amount of power will save the ship. but that's not how \nwarp drives work, they are a reactionless drive. they practically CREATE a \nwave in the water upon which the ship can ride, no matter what the water \nunderneath is doing.\n\nthis is actually a perfect analogy for a warp drive, since compressing \nspace time in front of a ship and expanding it behind it pretty much does \ncreate a wave in space time, a wave upon which a ship can ride, no matter \nwhat the space time beneath it is doing.\n\nthis is the loop hole that warp drives use to go faster than the speed of \nlight in the first place. although ships cannot go faster than the speed of \nlight, they can ride a warp bubble (a wave in space time), technically be \nstanding still, but use the wave to ride to faster than light speeds.\n\nagain, read the wiki, it explains in greater detail. if you read it, you'll \nsee why a warp drive can get a ship out of a black hole.\n\nI don't understand why this is such a difficult concept for people anyway. \nthe warp drive can go faster than the speed of light, so just by that fact \nalone, a ship powered by one can escape the event horizon (which is an \nimaginary barrier dictated only by the fact that it is the point at which \nlight cannot escape a black hole)",

THIS phenomenon looks exactly like cold \nfusion. the ring is a catalyst for the hydrogen in the water to fuse. no \nsuch material exists, but there are some that get close. palladium was \nfamously used in the Fleichmann and Pons cold fusion device. though it \nneeded to be electrified, and the reaction occured far slower, the \npalladium does act as a catalyst for cold fusion (in theory. the debate on \nthe fleichmann and pons device is a fierce one).\n\nso, it's clear they get what cold fusion is, yet intentionally get it \nwrong. they do this repeatedly throughout the new movies, and i really cant \nunderstand why.\n\nstar wars, on the other hand, requires much bigger leaps of the imagination \nto make that logic work.\n\nbut if you want a show that actually cares about scientific accuracy, i'd \nsuggest star gate SG1. it's pretty cool what they do with physics in some \nof those episodes.",

However, it is true that they potentially wouldnt have been \nable to distinguish the difference between the two without some sort of \nadvanced detector [perhaps wormholes emit a different radiation, who \nknows].  So my entire point boils down to, although they maybe cannot tell \nif it is a wormhole or not, using the convention \"black hole\" indicates a \nsingle side.",

And I completely agree with you \non the ripped apart thing [after all, Ive done problem set after problem \nset proving that what you say is correct], however, if they are even \nthinking about going into a black hole/wormhole, you would have to be \nsufficiently advanced in technology to produce some \"exotic matter\" [a \nscapegoat of sorts] to cause anti-grav effects.

We know that the difference \nin force between points is so great that it causes points to be ripped \napart.  Einstein derived the theory. Its called general relativity. And you \ncan tell things though mathematical proofs and watching stars being torn \napart by black holes. You dont have to experience it to know it to be true. \n For example, if I were to shoot you into the middle of the sun, I know you \nwould burn up instantaneously.
