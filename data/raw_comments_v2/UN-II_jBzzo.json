Land was in short supply so these villas were only for the rich and \nwealthy and each mansion was about 5 stories high. The bottom story was for \nstorage, as it flooded a lot and each house on the canal had a back door \nleading right into the water! (for supplies and delivery) \nToday however, all of the grass is gone except for small privately owned \nareas and public gardens (which are tiny and normally owned by museums) \n- All paths that have 'rio' in front of it's name used to be canals! They \nwere paved over during the rise of automobile popularity! (Even tho there \nare no cars in Venice, nice one Venice) \n- The foundations haven't been altered since it's construction almost 1200 \nyears ago! \n- The original saint of Venice was Saint Theodore of Amasea \n- There is a throne made of stone on one of the outer islands of Venice \nsaid to be the throne of Attila the Hun \ufeff",

The European nations were busy colonizing the world.\n\nPrinting only the Quran was considered haram, not any other book. \nMoreover it was not completely a religious ban. The printing press was an \nEuropean invention and it was more of a battle of ideas than religious \ninfluence. They never expected how useful it would be later on. Now every \ncopy of Quran is printed.
