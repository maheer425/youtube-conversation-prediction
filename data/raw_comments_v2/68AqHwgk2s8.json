No. It's just that it was okay, but I don't understand why people \ncall this AMAZING or why it gets so much hype. HTTYD 1 was way better to be \nhonest. I was a little disappointed. The plot was a bit rushed, but the \nmovie was somewhat enjoyable at some parts, but not \"the best\".  I still \nthought it would change my mind about Big Hero 6, but it didn't. RoTG was \nalso better than HTTYD 2. \nI'm sorry if I offended people with my review, I didn't mean for it to turn \nout that way. \ufeff",

Everyone has \ntheir own opinions. I personally love J\u00f3nsi's work, and I don't think \nrock/pop is the right way to describe it. He sings falsetto though, so I \nkind of get where you are going with that. Also, \"Where No One Goes\" \nactually does have an orchestra playing.
