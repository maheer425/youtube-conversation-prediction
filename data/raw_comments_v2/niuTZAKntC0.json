Not because he's \nblack, not because he's a Democrat; I honestly don't care about those \nartificial distinctions. What I do care about is the law. Obama has shown \nthat he has little regard for the rule of law. His unprecedented overuse of \nthe executive order has shown that he does not care about the Democratic \nprocess, something which you care about deeply. Added to that is his \nunwillingness to reveal details about Benghazi, which is reminiscent of \nRichard Nixon. So I am having trouble with the fact that you support him no \nmatter what.\ufeff",
