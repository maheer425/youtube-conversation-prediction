They were influential Ford \nshareholders before they went out on their own, and challenged Ford's use \nof capital and earned surplus for the social purpose of making the car \nuniversal rather than paying out dividends.  The (I think NY Court of \nAppeals) held that using surplus in the way Ford planned infringed upon \ninvestors reasonable expectation of return, and companies such as Ford \ncould not refuse to pay a dividend unless they could show a compelling \nbusiness justification; corporate boards could only act in the ultimate \nfavor of their shareholder constituency and could not benefit other \nconstituencies (i.e. employees) over shareholders.  Ford, angry over the \ncourt's intrusion into his Board room, decided to privatize the company, \nafter which the Dodge Brothers went and started their own car company to \nrealize the profits for themselves.  Ironically, the Dodge Brothers v. Ford \ndecision's dissent ended up spurring the creation of the \"Business Judgment \nRule\" in future decisions, under which a corporation's board may assert a \nlegitimate business purpose for their actions in the face of suits for \nbreach of fiduciary duty of care over how corporate money is spent - with \nexceptions.  Also, the response to the decision can be seen in the modern \nera in the Corporate Social Responsibility movement - in certain states, \ncompanies can include in their certificate of incorporation that they plan \non supporting a constituency or cause other than their shareholders, and no \none could sue for a breach of fiduciary duty on the grounds that they are \nsupporting a non-shareholder constituency because everyone knew what their \nplan was from the Certificate.\n\nSincerely,\nA 2L who just finished his Corporations class and wants to feel smart \nbecause he didn't land one of the 10 automatic 6 figure salary jobs open to \nBrooklyn Law School students\n\nPS - CrashCourse law school would be AMAZING\ufeff",

You had \npresidents like Roosevelt whose advisors were industrialists and bankers. A \nlot of these presidents passed laws that looked progressive but was really \ndesigned to quiet The People for a while before total anarchy happened \n(again, according to Zinn). Also see National Civic Foundation. So in \nshort, you had all these feminists and socialists who wanted a radical \nreform (these guys often favored \"direct action\" as opposed to negotiation) \nand they got shit done, and then you had the federal government who \nbasically chose the lesser evil in a way, and got laws passed mostly to \n\"stabilize capitalism\" because they recognized that if worker conditions \nand stuff didn't improve, they would be faced with an actual uprising that \nmight unseat the relatively new capitalist society (not to say that the \nlaws didn't benefit The People--regulation and stuff was definitely \nimportant and definitely helpful. Oh, also mention the Triangle Shirtwaist \nCompany as an example of regulation laws that weren't enforced) \n\nHope this helped and was on time!
