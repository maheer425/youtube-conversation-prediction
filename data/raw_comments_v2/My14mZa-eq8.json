The narrator should present all information available (and \nrelevant in any way, see Checkov's gun) as early as possible.  In this, \nHamlet's own story, and much of the play -- it is not about what Hamlet \nwill do, how things will end, but how will they get there, and what will \nthe final why be? We know from the first, Hamlet will kill, all we can do \nis wait, and since the stakes are so high with that, it gives the whole \nthing a nice tension.\n\nSide-note: I really wish movies and even books these days could be about \nsomething OTHER than saving the world. Two of my favourite plays (or \nanything really) are Julius Caesar and Hamlet, in both the main driving \nplot is that you know going in that one man will die, more than that may \nhappen, but that's where the baseline tension comes from -- ONE life, not 7 \nbillion.\ufeff",

            "text": "+OfficialPlayer1 \nFirst I need to correct my original statement: I did not cover all of these \nin freshman English, I covered all of them at various points of schooling \nthru highschool, some of them repeatedly. Tho, at least in Texas, I do know \nRomeo and Juliet and To Kill a Mockingbird were/are staples of freshman \nEnglish. \n\nNow then, \n\nI'm going to assume hyperbole on your part but point taken. I have a couple \nthoughts on that -- One, nobody ever said English need be about literature \n-- there's good argument for that focus, especially as the basic command of \nEnglish, vocabulary especially, should be taken as a given in highschool, I \nthink -- but there's still that argument that it should be about technical \nwriting or critical reading or whatever else.\n\nTwo, some schools are just. . . well, terrible. Standardized tests really \nare vocab lists, and not even in the arguably useful sense of Literary \njargon, but just SAT prep lists that are esoteric, archaic and. . .useless \nreally. It is entirely possible you attend a school overtaken by 'teaching \nto the test'.\n\nThen again, it is also possible that students in your school are doing \npoorly (reason ignored here due to the complexity of even trying to offer \npossibilities as to why, and the fallacy of doing so with literally no good \ninformation) -- in such a case it is not uncommon to slow the pace of \nlearning, with some strange intent of being able to 'catch-up' .. .by \nlearning more slowly. . . . Net result, literature might be saved for the \nSophomore or Junior years to actually start proper. \n\nOnly example I have is my own. Freshman year, Romeo and Juliet was school \nmandate (my class never got to it, but it was on the final exam), Hamlet \n(ditto), To Kill A Mockingbird (even tho we did that in 8th grade AND as \nsummer work before entering the 9th) and the Odyssey (abridged) . .which in \na different school district I had actually done back in 6th grade as part \nof an advanced English course.\n\nSophomore year was 6 weeks of \"A tree symbolizes life, a rock symbolizes \nEarth\" and other nonsense (my bias) with the Princess Bride -- then Gatsby, \nCatcher in the Rye was still banned at my school but my instructor gave me \na copy, Romeo and Juliet again, Julius Caesar, about 5 sonnets, we picked a \npoet (I picked Shelley) Frankenstein and Jane Eyre. I'm forgetting a lot \nhere, but I have no idea what. Grapes of Wrath maybe? Oh! Huck Finn, \ndefinitely that. \n\nJunior year was the rest of the crash course reading list (which I had \nalready read in sophomore or freshman year), a segment on poetry, and the \nrest of it was just the structure of an essay -- basically being told that \nthe standardized test format is a really bad way to write essays, but also, \nyou have to be able to do it anyway. Also, probably Moby Dick.  I \ndefinitely read it that year, I think I did it in class...maybe. \n\nSenior year I skipped a lot because I had a job to go to but I remember \ncovering the Romantic Poets again, but in much more detail (toi be fair, I \nhad picked one, not been assigned all of them, before), re-doing the \nOdyssey as kind of like a  \"See how much deeper you can read if you want \nto?\", also it was not the abridged version this time, Gone With the Wind, \nTaming of the Shrew, Macbeth, there was a small segment on Gothic \nliterature, and a heavy focus in general just on responding to 'critical \nreading' short-essay questions to prepare for both the exit exam (if you \nhadn't already passed) and the SAT (if you hadn't already taken it. . \n.having done both I didn't really get then or now why I even had a senior \nyear). \n\nAll-in-all I have this to say of highschool, and it seems to be (at least \nanecdotally) true for many. In highschool I was, in theory, taught how to \nread, and how to learn. I already knew how to read at the exit level by the \ntime I entered highschool, and never got challenged beyond simple rote \nmemorization . .. and thus never learned to actually learn anything  -- so \nI bombed my freshman year of college, barely managed to get back to a 3.0 \nby the end of my BA, and wondered forever what the hell the point was. \n\nMorever -- literally everything you learn in highschool is covered once \nmore in your general requirements at university, just crammed into half as \nmuch time, with harder tests (for some classes, some are just as easy as \nhighschool was). At my college I found ONLY my specific course work (upper \nlevel coursework in english and history) offered any real ..teaching. . \n.but I did precious little upper level coursework outside my field, so \nobvious bias there. \n\nMy advice -- if you want to learn. Crash course is a perfect example that \nthe internet is your best friend. You can learn whatever you want, for \nfree, but the impetus must be entirely your own. \n\nTL;DR. . . I can't remember the quote I want exactly, but this one will do \n\" nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with ... Education \"",
