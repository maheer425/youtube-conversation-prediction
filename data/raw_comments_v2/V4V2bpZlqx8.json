So one very simple improvement would \nbe to separate the patch cables into inward swaps and outward swaps, rather \nthan the double patch cables used. Thus any letter out of the rotors could \npotentially end up as any other letter. The machine itself would be the \nsame, it would just need new patch cables - think pin cables and thin pin \ncables. \n\nI appreciate this isn't a complete fix tho, because the completely \nunpatched letters still exhibit the original fault due to the rotors.\ufeff",
