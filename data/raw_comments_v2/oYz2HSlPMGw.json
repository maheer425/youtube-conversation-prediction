Whenever I use it, I simply follow the instructions ok the back, (dip \nmy whole nail/finger in, wait 4 minutes, swipe with cotton ball, then wash \noff). Yet every time I do exactly as told, I still get a crappy result. \nI've done this method many times now, and so far, no luck for me. Whenever \nI go to take off the nail polish with a cotton pad/ball, the goopy nail \npolish gets stuck inside my nails, and I am left with a sticky, gooey mess \nall over my fingers and nails. Then once I go to rinse them off, I get \nnothing but more sticky goo all over my fingers again. This product is very \nuseless to me, and I am quite disappointed as well. I only wish this worked \nas well as it sounded.... \ud83d\ude13\n\n\nThanks for the advice though,\n\n~H\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ufeff",
