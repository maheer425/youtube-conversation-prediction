And \ntherefore sound like a broken record. In short, he's a blooming idiot. As \nfor what Jesse said, while its true that Obama inherited Bush's mess, \"IF\" \nJesse ever becomes president, all he'll do is, inherit Obama's mess. And \nthis'll just go on & on & on. No way, no matter WHO the president is, will \nbe able in 4 or even 8 years if they get re-elected will be able to fix \nthis country. Its gonna take more than 4 to 8 years to pull that one off. \nI'm reminded of what Ben Jones once said. You may know him as Cooter the \nmechanic on the show Dukes Of Hazzard. What you might NOT know is, he was \nonce in Washington. After his time there, I saw em on TV & he said, & I \nhave to agree with him cos he makes sense when he said this, he said, \n\"There's no \"quick\" fix to our country's problems. You cant just wave an \numbrella over it or a magic wand over it & say \"Poof\" its fixed. It took \nYEARS to get it this way, & it'll take YEARS to fix it. In short, there's \nno \"Quick\" fix to it.\"  And like it or not, he is SO RIGHT on all accounts. \nNow the next president might make things a little better or allot worse, \nbut on the better side, its not gonna get ALLOT better. Not in no 4 to 8 \nyears it won't. Just look at how many years its taken, for this country to \nget in the shape its in now. And believe you me, its taken way more than 8 \nyears to get there.

You definitely have issues \nas you waste all this time talking about Fox News making things up and then \nyou say things which are totally absurd.   \n\nAs the UK Business Insider article you reference actually says that the \nU.S. may be consciously or inadvertently taking part in Iran's plans in \nIraq.  Do you know what the word 'MAY' means?  It does not mean \n'DEFINITIVE.'  You've made a total fool of yourself and there's not one \nintellectually honest argument you can now put forth to undo that fact. ",

Because as to the first \nquestion, regarding Iran, whatever news station or stations you watch \nobviously do not provide you with the proper information.  As we have no \nidea as to what the deal the overall specifics of the deal are, and thus, \nthere is no way you can intelligently make a decision as to whether or not \nit is something we should support.  And as to a few things which have \nleaked out, the U.S. says it means one thing, while the Iranians say it \nmeans something altogether different.  So obviously, you appear to take the \nNancy Pelosi approach to things as you obviously think it's WISE to find \nout about something, ONLY AFTER THE DEAL IS DONE, and then we can read it.  \nYou realize, of course, that this is precisely happened with Obamacare, as \nvery few people knew what was truly in it and many of the things President \nObama said were or would not happen were shown to be demonstrably false.  \nOr didn't the BBC tell you that?  lol\n\n Also, I'm glad to see that at least you got part of the second question \ncorrect inasmuch as you referenced Bill Clinton's role.  Also, I have \ncriticized President Bush on many issues, but as to the banks and very poor \nor lacking regulations, which is the major reason for the economic \ncollapse, whatever news outlet you watched obviously did not give you the \nright information as to that either.  Because notice how you tie in Bush \nwith the banks and the GSEs (the Government Sponsored Entities - Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac) even though George Bush, several years before the housing \nmarket bubble, was sounding the alarm as to the need for the regulations \nthat you speak of.  And, both the White House and Republicans in Congress \ncontinuously put forth efforts to put in place the needed \nlegislation/regulation that would have averted the crisis.  The Democrats, \nhowever, who usually are very big on regulations, were absolutely opposed \nto the needed regulations wanted by both Bush and the GOP.  Moreover, then \nSenator Obama was very much on record saying that he would be glad to \nfilibuster any Republican attempts to put in place those regulations if \nthey could get them to the Senate floor.  And, I can very easily come back \nwith the names of the legislation and the specifics, while I can post the \nvideos of the congressional hearings in which the democrats were so unified \nin being against Bush and the GOP on this particular issue.  So how is it \nthat an individual like yourself, who watches such trustworthy new's \nsources got the overall answer to both of these questions wrong?  Well, the \nanswer is rather clear, as only a total partisan would be in support of a \ndeal with Iran when no one in the media has any idea as to the real \nhardcore specifics.  And, you wouldn't know about Bush and the GOP fighting \nfor those regulations to stop the housing crisis because the left wing \nmedia would be the ones to either not report the information in a timely \nmanner or under report the story.  So don't go talking to me about not \nknowing anything about economics, like a smart ass, as you have no idea \nwhat you are talking about.  And yes, the joke has gone too far, as it's on \ninasmuch as you're lack of knowledge is STUNNING.    While, the truth is,  \nthe GOP and the DEMOCRATS both have good and bad ideas.  But as to the \nhousing crisis, and the regulations that were needed, that I am SO, SO \nGLAD you brought up, Bush and the GOP were in the right place at the right \ntime as to that issue.  You've lost hands down and it's rather amusing \ngiven your smugness and how you like to lead others to believe that you \nactually know what you're talking about;-)",

While PBS is quite left wing and I don't watch \nthe BBC enough to know.  There is also a difference between straight news, \nwhich Fox does as well as anyone, and then opinion, commentary and \nentertainment.  And Fox is quite good at the latter, too, as it's part of \nthe reason they have such high ratings.  O'Reilley and Hannity are not \nSTRAIGHT news men.  Their shows offer their opinions and their shows, too, \nalso offer the opinions of those on the left.  So what is wrong with that?  \nI know they cut people off, sometimes, as that is just their style.  It \nalso, sometimes, makes for good TV.  And no, they don't always cut them off \nbecause they are losing a debate.  I've seen O'Reilley when he has been \nright and wrong.  And a good deal of the time when he interrupts it's \nbecause the other person has gone off on a tangent and won't give him a \nstraight answer.  Let's do this and see how intellectually honest you are.  \n(1)  Do you support or are you against the deal with Iran? and (2) What was \nthe major for our economic collapse prior to President Obama coming into \noffice?  If the news shows you watch give the facts in a clear, \nnon-partisan way, I am quite sure you will give the answers to what are \nrather easy questions.",

Also, if you \nwatch his show, after he gives his talking points memo, he always turns to \na liberal democrat first and asks them to then tell the audience where he \nwent wrong. So in the overall presentation, how can that be considered more \nbiased than the Young Turks, who are in this link, and hardly ever have \nanyone from the other side to offer rebuttal?  I know you don't like Fox, \nbut they actually do have a lot of liberal democrats on to make sure that \nwhen a person watches they come away having heard both sides of an argument \nand can then make their own decision.  It's true that their commentators \nare conservative, but what I said as to putting forth the other side just \ncan not be denied.",
