Why would we look at fossils to observe evolution when we \ncan look at living life? Even humans have very clear signs of our evolution \nover time, parts of us that once had purpose and no longer does such \nas:body hair, wisdom teeth, the appendix, male nipples, the erector pili, \ncoccyx (tail bone), Plica semilunaris, Darwin\u2019s point (flap of skin on \near), vomeronasal organ, and auricular muscles. All of those are parts of \nour \"perfect\" bodies that have no purpose at all, once maybe, now no, and \nmany of which are major faults, like the wisdom teeth and appendix that \ndoes more than nothing, they can actually cause infections, the appendix \ncan burst being very fatal. I'll admit I'm not a religious person, but I'm \nnot atheist, I realize that the world isn't perfect, the universe isn't \nperfect, and that humanity is a small little spec within a small solar \nsystem with an average star, on the edge of an average galaxy in a sea of \nliterally over 500 billion other galaxies in the known universe all of \nwhich that has billions of stars, and trillions of planets.
