A few years ago I got a call from the LVPD informing \nme that she had been found in an alley behind a Von's in Las Vegas and had \nOD'd. So, my cousin lost his mother that way and his childhood was not the \nbest although when my aunt had him he was taken very good care of. I think \nit was what happened to him in his childhood that made him unstable and \nbrought out the psychosis and eventually, severe Schizophrenia. I'm just \nglad to know where he is.
