It's almost as if, there's a factory somewhere with \none type of skater mold and all skaters nowadays came from it lol. You're \nright, man. Their perspectives are hella twisted. The other day, I saw some \nkid here online hating on \"Blind: Video Days\" claiming that nobody was \ndoing anything \"big or video worthy\". Kids nowadays, just wanna see someone \nswitch 3 flip a 26 stair, or they wanna see someone hardflip backlip a 17 \nstair handrail. Don't get me wrong, monsterous sets and handrails are \ngnarly beyond gnarly, but there's more to skating then just huge sets and \nhandrails. The Reynolds 3 x Shake Junt collab look dope. You can't go wrong \nwith a pair of Reynolds, dude knows how to make a perfect shoe lol. I've \nheard nothin but good things when it comes Figgy's Emericas. They're simple \nand to the point, and I'm sure they skate like a dream. Yooo, if you find \nsomewhere online that's sellin more than 1 pair of Braydon's Low Pro \nEmericas, lemme know! Lmao. I wanted the Green/black/green ones for the \nlongest time. So sick. I'm bummed he left Emerica. Why did he leave, \nthough? I just know he left, but I've never researched why. All I \npractically skate is ES lol. I was so bummed when eS \"went of business\" for \na minute. I mean, they're still on the rocks, but thank the Skate Gods that \nthey re-released the Accels lol. They're pretty much the same as before, \njust more true size and somewhat durable. The ONLY drawback, is the lack of \ncolorways lol, but I can't complain. It's just sick to have um and be able \nto get um. Emerica really is one of the best shoe companies around. They're \nso many companies nowadays, that aren't run by skaters for skaters.
