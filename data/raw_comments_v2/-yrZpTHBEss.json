With three primary colors how many different shades and colors can \nwe see? A shit load. But with sixteen? Well, we can't even imagine a color \nwe've never seen before, so we haven't even named these colors. We know \nthey exist because of the length of the waves. If we were to invent a \ncamera to see these colors we STILL couldn't see them. Wanna know why? \nBecause our eyes couldn't see the colors in the picture. 8% of men have \nsome form of colorblindness. This doesn't mean they see in black in white, \njust with less colors. Or, the lack of red for people who are red \ncolorblind. Only 0.5% of women have some form of colorblindness though. \nBlue being the rarest, in only about 5% of colorblind people. About 0.3% of \nwomen though have an EXTRA cone (the little things inside your eyes that \nallow you to see colors, rods are the other one, which allow you to see \nshades) which means they can see 4 primary colors, a single color that we, \nas stated previously, haven't even named yet!\nAny questions? No? Good.\ufeff",
