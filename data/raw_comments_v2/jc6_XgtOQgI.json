People all of all colors, shapes, back grounds, etc are \nnot born with racism or hate in their hearts. These things are TAUGHT \nthrough movies like this and school's teaching about the KKK. I am a young \n26 yrs old Italian male now. But from a very young age I have always had \nAfrican American friends we just seemed to always get along. Racism at the \nage of 7 never crossed my mind not once I was too young to even understand \nwhat that even meant at the time. And if BULLSHIT ass movies like this \nwhere not made and where washed out over the years no one would know. All I \nknew was that my family members where Italian so when I saw this movie at a \ntender age it blew me back and displayed some very disgusting things. \nRacist comments from both sides, violence against one another, things I \nhave never seen etc. Spike Lee obviously has the upper hand in this movie \nand displays to the viewers that it's the African Americans that have the \nlast word vs everyone else and tries to display with dominance at the end \nof the movie by destroying other people's property. The whole movie is \nabout racist comments back and forth and spike lee tries to discredit what \nthe other men in the movie have to say and that African Americans have all \nthe talent and everything anyone could want in life. He tries to push this \nwith propaganda to younger viewers. Color has ZERO to do with happiness, \nhealth, wealth, etc. These things have to do with Will power and having the \nright mind set. These things aren't about color they are about small minded \nweak individuals with low self esteem. Kill this BS so American's of all \nCOLOR can grow!\ufeff",
