HIs sustain is absolutely ridiculous. I only found reason to \nrecall back to the base if my health was below 100 and a enemy could turret \ndive and my bloodwell was on a cooldown ;or I just plainly needed items. \nHis damage is exceptional (N.T.M. he has one of the highest base damage \nstats in the game) and he excels at countering top lane champions like \nMaster Yi. His passive is the best in the entire game, I don't care what \nanyone says, as some champion comes to turret dive at low health you pop \nyour E then your W.

The issue is also that his hardest \nmatchups are more than half of the usual top lane picks.Though I think that \nif Aatrox goes at least even during the laning phase (built-in sustain \nmakes it even easier) he becomes a formidable force in the mid-late game. \nAnyone who says that some champion in the League sucks is a butthurt \nbronzie who cant get out of \"elo hell\".
