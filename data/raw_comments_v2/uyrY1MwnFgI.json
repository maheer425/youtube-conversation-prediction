In prison, inmates with good behavior were \ngranted with jobs - it was a reward. People have a natural tendency to \ncontribute, but in the society we currently live in; it's hard to get up in \nthe morning for a low paid meaningless job so you can make the people at \nthe top richer. People should get a wage from the Government for doing \nabsolutely nothing. Why? Because all the free time as studies have shown; \nwill be helping the community. People will volunteer to work meaningful \njobs. If you were to put every citizen on benefits, you will find the \npeople who are currently on benefits who don't need it, will want to help \nthe community.",

Now you want to apply a moral equivalence see and say that because I \nproved Fox News was the balance that not only does Fox News suck but all \nnews sucks now and of course not this leftist video that I found you on. \nWhich by the way there free to say all the stupid things they want to say \nthat they can't back out but I believe they're free to say them",

I \nthought I had made myself very clear: Fox does not really present both \nsides equally, or present facts like they should be presented, which we \nboth agree on, but they do balance out the news picture somewhat, as they \nstrongly favor republican ways of thinking, while most others are more \ndemocratic. I do not think that any news network should be as biased as \nthey seem to be in the US. There will of course always be some political \nfavor, but Fox is an extreme. And as I said, even though they like to \npretend that they present facts neutrally, and represent both sides of the \npolitical axis, they do not.\nThat will be it for this year, I think, but I suppose I will hear from you \nnext year.",
