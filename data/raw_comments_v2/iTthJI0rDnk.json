I did think of \nthat, but I guessed I dismissed it.\n\nAlthough I do agree that what made it funny was that she was crazy \n(which had nothing to do with her gender identity), but I do think that the \ntranswoman theme is also played off slightly as a joke, through the way \nthat they left stubble on the transwoman's face and she did not pass very \nwell. It probably would've been quite the same had it been a cisgender \nwoman, but that shows that the adding of the trasgender trait was quite \nunnecessary and was clearly one of the jokes.\n\nI like the video, it's funny, but I don't like the trans part, it makes me \nfeel uncomfortable, as it feels like they are mocking trans people. I would \nhave liked the video much better had the woman either not be trans or pass \nvery well, because then that would eliminate the trans joke.",

So \nthe trans woman in this music video could have raped him. Also she very \nobviously is crazy. It's not the fact that she's a transgender person, its \nthe fact that she's mentally unstable and a rapist that scares the man in \nthis video so much.
