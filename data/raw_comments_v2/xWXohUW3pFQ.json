Mistake's place was replaced by Dinter, which was \nhorribly bad IMO. Later in the mid S3, Lilbalz was found that he was using \nhis friends account to play. Under the slogan of \"NO ELO BOASTING\", Lilbalz \nwas banned for any competition for 1year, and he decided to quit \ncompetitive and work as an e-sports coach. After about 1-2 month, Toyz and \nStanley both posted posts on their Facebook Fanpage, saying that they are \nnot happy with( or pissed by) the new teammates Dinter and Sarsky( who \nreplaced Lilbalz) performance, plus Toyz right wrist was injured due to \nconcentrated practices, so they decided to quit TPA and both became the \nback stage of HK-Esports ( who owns HKA and HKA.P(the TW HKA squad) ). As a \nresult, only bebe stayed on TPA ATM, but don't be worry, the new TPA have \nwon the GPL series and they've qualified themselves to the S4 World \nChampionship. (TPA had too much trouble that they didn't made into the S3 \nWorlds)",

It's way more balanced , and \nteam centric. Teamwork either makes or breaks a game , while in the \noriginal dota  , (have you even played it actually? or you are just hating \nto follow the trends?) , i could generally solo carry a game on a Mordred , \nor a Void if i got 2 items and didn't fed in early. That being said , dota \nalso has it's better points , like the ability to block/delay minions , or \ndeny them....and that requires a bit more mechanical skill. On the side \nnote , lol focuses more on people actually trading in lines and making \nplays , so it's rather more enjoyable. In the end , it's all about tastes , \nbut from an objective stand point , lol is probably the better game. Now \ndid you even understood what i said here , or you're just a dumb troll just \nseeking attention?",
