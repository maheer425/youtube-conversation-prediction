            "text": "Recently I was watching news reports about the guy that flew a gyrocopter \nonto the White House lawn. NBC interviewed his family and the criminal \nwhich had his views, reasoning, concerns and beliefs. Fox News called him a \nknucklehead twice as well as another name I can't recall (twice) then \ninterviewed a gyrocopter instructor and a reporter. I can't help but feel \nlike Fox News should have news in quotations.\n\nI can accept both side's views on bias but on this particular case but I \ncan't help but feel Fox didn't report the whole story because of their \npolitical interests. Again, you can say the same for both. I'm just saying \non that particular story it is clear- The pilot's goal was to reduce \nspending in presidential elections. Fox did not forget to include this \nfact, they purposefully omitted this fact in order to insult and discredit \nnot only him but the entire idea of restricted spending on presidential \ncandidate spending.\n\nEdit: Punctuation errors and I hope you can forgive the rest of the \ngrammatical errors. I don't mean to start a flame war. If anything please \ndon't respond to this but possibly take this into consideration- all media \nhas a personal and political bias and maybe before solidifying an opinion \nthat you could look at all the sides of an argument and base your opinion \noff of that.\n\nTL;DR: Fox raked gyrocopter guy over the coals and ignored any concerns \nwith the government he had which was unfair considering his reasonable \ncomplaints. That being said- I do not condone any activity that violates \nfederal law.\n\nEdit: Almost forgot what video I'm on. Seriously don't respond to this. \nLive long and prosper. May the force be with you. I hope whatever deity you \nbelieve in is responsive. Just remember to be respectful. This video is \nawesome regardless and we should all drink to that!\ufeff",
