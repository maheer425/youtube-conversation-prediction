But, if you look closer, it is full of \natoms with the electrons all moving about very fast. The movement of the \nelectrons make a very small contribution to the mass of the orange.\n\nThen, if you look further still, inside all of the atoms are protons and \nneutrons and these are moving about too, and their movement makes a \ncontribution to the mass of the orange.\n\nIf you look further, you see that protons and neutrons are made up of quark \nand gluons, which are all moving very fast, in fact most of the mass \n(something like 80%) of the orange is made up of the energy of the \ninteraction of the quarks and gluons.\n\nWhile we know that most of the orange's mass is made up of movement of the \nquarks and gluons and some contribution from the protons, neutrons and \nelectrons, is there a rest mass of quarks or electrons?\n\nMaybe, but we don't know. Most if the \"rest mass\" of the electron and quark \n(which only makes up a small fraction of the orange) is thought to be from \ninteraction with the Higgs field, but this is still an interaction, so you \ncould sort of think of it as movement. In the very early universe it was \nthough that the Higgs field did not interact with particles and essentially \neverything was massless in the same way that the photon is massless. Do I \nunderstand what that means? Not really, but that is what physics says.\n\nFinally, the neutrino, which is very similar to the electron without an \nelectric charge, has been measured to have a rest mass much smaller than an \nelectron. The current mathematical representation of physics says that \nneutrinos should not have a mass, which means that there is physics at work \nthat we do not understand.\n\nSo, it is possible that mass can exist without momentum, but so far every \ntime we have looked closer, it is particles moving around that produces the \nmass.

So, the sheep is actually only going 2 \"miles per train-second\" \nrelative to the train, which is why you can't simply add up the speeds.\n\n\n(Example: If I have a twin, and he takes a trip to the star Alpha Centauri \nat 99% the speed of light and comes back, I'll have aged significantly more \nthan my twin. Someone can do the math and see exactly how much younger than \nhim I'd be.)\n\n\nOf course, the train is moving relative to you, but you're also moving \nrelative to the train! So, the train's time is slower than yours... *and* \nyour time is slower than the train's?! Well, depends on the observer. \nSomeone on the train would look at you and see you moving (relative to the \nground) faster than they'd expect, and vise versa. But if the train turns \naround to come back to you, it has *accelerated* (i.e. changing speed \nand/or direction) and you have not, which straightens things out a bit. \nOnce the train comes back, assuming you haven't moved, the train will have \naged slightly less than you have.\n\n\nSomeone should correct me on any and all mistkaes that I may have made here.",

Look at two cases:\n1) Light: Rest mass is zero, m=0. Energy is then E=p*c. Energy comes from \nlight's movement (actually, it cannot stand still), as it does for all \nmassless particles.\n2) A chunk of material in your room: It's velocity, v, is tiny compared to \nspeed of light c. Therefore the momentum is approximately p=m*v, and the \nsecond term is tiny compared to the first. You can approximate the formula \nthen, obtaining:\nE = m * c^2 + (m* v^2)/2\n(note I took the square root of the first formula). This is just your \nNewtonian kinetic energy, plus the Einstein's part m*c^2, which represents \nthe relativistic content of the rest mass and does not influence Newtonian \nmovement since it is just a constant.

So \nif you want to change the absolute value of the Higgs field, there's an \nenergy cost, just like there would with a pendulum. So the Higgs field is a \nregular, well behaved field with positive mass squared. But it wasn't \nalways this way. In the early universe, the potential didn't look like that \npicture -- the potential was modified by the high temperature of the \nuniverse. So, it looked something like this:\n\ncf.ydcdn. net/ 1.0.1. 30/images/main/paraboloid.jpg\n\nThe lowest energy state was when the Higgs was sitting in the bottom of the \nbowl,  |\u03d5| = 0. Here, too, there's an energy cost to changing the value of \nthe field and the Higgs is a good, well behaved field.\n\nHowever, at some point the temperature dropped below some critical value \nand the field went from looking like a bowl to looking like a Mexican hat. \nWhen that happened, there was no longer an energy cost to change the value \nof the field. Instead, there was an energy *gain*, just like in the \ninverted pendulum case! At this exact moment, the universe has a tachyon. \nVery quickly the field \"rolls off\" to the newly formed valley and \neverything stabilizes again.\n\nThis process is termed Tachyon condensation. Just like the pendulums could \nspontaneously fall down and oscillate widely (we call the oscillations \n\"particles\"), the Higgs can roll off to the new value that minimizes the \npotential energy and produce a bunch of particles in the process. \n\nThat's what a tachyon is: an object in a description of a theory with an \nunstable ground state.",

            "text": "+Smithy0013 Yes, that's what makes it common. Even a guy who gave a talk in \nmy department said that. It really is a misconception though, and I'll \nexplain why.\n\nThe most fundamental description of reality that we know and understand is \nquantum field theory. As the name indicates, this is a theory of fields, \nextended wavelike objects, rather than pointlike particles. Indeed, if you \ntry to think of tachyons as pointlike objects, you might conclude that they \nmove faster than the speed of light... but that rests on the assumption \nthat you can indeed recover the naive billiard ball-like \"particle\" \nbehavior from the underlying field theory. It turns out that you can only \nreally do that for particles with a nonnegative mass squared. \n\nI understand that you don't want to take me at my word so I'll link two \nauthoritative places that agree with me:\n\n1. John Baez does the field analysis properly and demonstrates that there \nare two types of tachyon \"waves\":\n\nmath.ucr. edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/tachyons.html\n\nOne is a delocalized disturbance with crests that do move faster than light \nbut which are useless for transmitting information because it's delocalized \nanyway. The other is simply a pulse traveling at exactly the speed of \nlight. It *must* be this way for tachyons to even make sense as a concept. \nQuantum field theory takes causality to be an axiom, which would be \nviolated by any kind of faster than light information transfer.\n\n2. Lenny Susskind discusses the tachyons which appear in naive \nquantizations of (bosonic) string theory:\n\nwatch?v=gCyImLu0HSI&t=58m51s\n\nHe puts it far less charitably than I would: \"only crackpots think that \ntachyons move faster than the speed of light\" :)\n\nHe gives a cute example which neatly encapsulates what a tachyon is. \n\"Mass\", in quantum field theory, is merely an energy price for a field to \nhave a nonzero value at a given point. Imagine a bunch of pendulums hanging \nfrom a metal bar. Let's say that my \"field\" at a given position is the \ndisplacement from the vertical of the pendulum at that point. There's an \nenergy price to displace each pendulum, that depends on the mass of the \nbob, the acceleration due to gravity, the length of the rod and that sort \nof thing. That's a positive mass squared. Now invert every pendulum: you'll \nhave an extremely unstable situation, but that's the point. If you displace \na pendulum from the vertical, there's no energy price -- in fact, you *gain* \nkinetic energy by doing that. That's a negative mass squared. However, in \neither case there is a maximum propagation velocity for signals which is \nreally the speed of sound in the metal bar. There's no way that simply \ninverting the pendulums allows you to exceed the \"cosmic speed limit\" for \nthis simple system, which is the physical intuition behind Baez's \nmathematical proof.",
