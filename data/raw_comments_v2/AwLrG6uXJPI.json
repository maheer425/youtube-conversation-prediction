This can \ncan also be true in Korean (i.e. bridge and leg are the same) but there are \nsome instances where placing extra emphasis on the syllables in two words \nthat sound the same will change its meaning. In my example I was showing my \nwife's friend's boyfriend a picture of my niece. In Korea niece or nephew \nis called joe-ka.
