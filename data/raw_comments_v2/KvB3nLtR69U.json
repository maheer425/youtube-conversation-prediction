For example: \nWhining slightly, circling, going to the door, restlessness, etc.Oh, and \nconfining puppy to his crate is NOT a bad thing if its done CORRECTLY. ie \nGetting him used to it SLOWLY. Using treats and praise to gently get him \nused to the idea of being inside it.. He'll soon learn its his 'sanctuary' \nor safe place. Tell kids to leave him alone when he is in his crate.

I have been leaving my 9 week \nold pup in a doggie \"playpen\"  when I can't be there or pay attention so \nshe goes on the vinyl floor (because the pads were not working out), which \nis easy to clean.  Do I need to try to use the pads by taping them or \nsomething (highly likely, she will find a way to chew on them anyway)?   Or \nwill this work in time without them?  She will go immediately when I take \nher outside -and seems to know the \"go potty\" command (I gave her treats in \nthe beginning for going at 7 weeks and she picked it up right away). I have \nher in a crate at night and she has only peed in there one time.  I can't \nseem to make any progress with not going in the playpen though (sometimes \nit's like every 20 minutes!).  Is this normal for her age?  I'm guessing \nit's because she is only in there when I am too busy to follow her around \nor when I am gone.  When I let her around the house, I watch her every \nminute so I can catch her in the act of going, say \"no\" and take her out \n(and praise her if she finishes there).  She seems to do better free in the \nhouse than in the pen, so I'm wondering if she has just learned (or thinks) \nthat it is ok to go there and if this will ever reverse.\ufeff",
