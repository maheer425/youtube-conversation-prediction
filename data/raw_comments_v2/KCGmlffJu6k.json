            "text": "I think people need to stop seeing the current state of \"cruelty\" to \nanimals as being a requirement rather than an optional choice we make. All \nanimals are naturally programmed to take each other out and use other \nanimals for whatever purpose they require. Morality right/wrong is a human \ninvention with no rules except for the ones we made. Caring about each \nother is one thing though, but caring about things not our species is a \nrather different and generous thing. There are of course some species we've \nactually evolved to work alongside or who have evolved to work alongside \nus, like dogs, horses, the organisms that are in or make up our very bodies \netc. There are also other species' that work together and treat each other \nbetter because it's mutually beneficial. On the other hand, there are \nspecies' that are natural enemies and\n\nImagine if owls had the ability to create and do all the things we can. Do \nyou reckon they'd be kind to mice and consider harming them immoral? Would \nlions all argue with each other over how \"humanely\" they should execute \ntheir prey? Would sharks not still be vicious assholes? Would spiders \nbecome vegetarians?\n\nI think we have to give ourselves as a species some credit for how we treat \nanimals. We DO really care, more than any other species, but at some point \nwe have to accept that we are supposedly a dominant species and we have the \ncapability to use and treat these animals in many ways, to certain extents. \nIt seems like a weird train of thought, simply because we're so used to the \npractise of treating animals kindly. We are people who were all born into a \nworld where this is was a rule. But humans invented this rule, we didn't \nlive before then or during the long periods throughout history where \n\"animal rights\" has grown and grown to the point where it even starts to \nnegatively impact our own species. Each generation of people looks at the \nold rules and thinks they can do one better... but the fact they think it's \n\"better\" is only based on the rule existing in the first place. If the \nrules were all to treat certain species' as specifically as possible for a \nparticular reason, then THIS would be improved upon generation after \ngeneration... cognitive bias!\n\nWe keep tacking-on to rules which were completely optional in the first \nplace. To a point, it was beneficial to us, which is most likely why the \noriginal rules came about. However the rules have been built on regardless \nof whether they're beneficial, because we just associate the rule existing \nwith the rule being right and seeing how we can make the rule more \npowerful, without actually understanding why the rule exists. This is a \nproblem which has most likely been hit by our communication. While most \nspecies have limited communication and don't generally pass down moral \ncodes, we have the communication to pass down rules, however we use our \ncommunication in a limited capacity and fail to realise what another person \nneeds communicating to them in order to understand the actual concept, and \nI think this has caused a lot of life's simple issues to become way more \ncomplex. We'll tell someone some rule is for good, but forget to mention \nthat it's still optional, because we really want them to follow it, etc.\n\nSo, while we may still have the ability to say \"right, wait a minute, where \ndid these rules come from in the first place?\", maybe we should realise \nthat considering there are absolutely no rules in life, we are incredibly \ngenerous and peace-loving creatures (yeah, I know, doesn't seem like it \nright?). We judge each other harshly, based on rules that our ancestors all \nmade up in the first place. Rules that weren't originally ever as strictly \nfollowed as they may be today. I think, to a certain extent, we really need \nto realise that, or we risk continually restricting our own progress. It's \ngood that we have these rules, it shows we're worthy of calling ourselves \nsuperior, but lets not forget that we're superior and that no one gave us \nthese rules except ourselves. If breaking them once or twice truly benefits \nus and others of our species, then we definitely ought to not let our own \nrules be our demise. This study could apparently help quite a lot of people \nfor generations and generations to come, so I think an experiment on a few \nmice, whose lives aren't actually being taken from them or being made to \nsuffer a whole lot, balances out fairly well. I just hope all of those mice \ngot an equal opportunity to cross the electrified bridge to get to the \nsugar, because apparently the sugar was well worth that suffering in their \nown minds, so we can rest assured that we can do a certain amount to them \nas long as we give them a bowl of sugar afterwards. Like when you take a \nchild for ice cream as a bribe.\n\n+Jacques Lecockgrande All living things are conscious you moron. And it's \npretty damn obvious to see that those mice do.\n\nYES, even microorganisms like bacteria...\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbial_intelligence",
