But the law thing is \nthe problem. There seems to be no subjective way to decide if something is \ngood or bad, it's based only on values. That's where the panel of judges \ncomes into play. It's pretty easy to say that they'll decide the world is \nbad if everyone is dead. But it will probably be a harder decision than \nthat. So asking the judges will be asking a sample of the general public, \nsince that's who this affects.

People usually \nfind a way to bring justice to evil doers. I think no matter who gets send \nto the evil baby orphanage, the strength of the masses will always ensure \nthat the outcome will eventually be okay. It's not going to be like a Meet \nthe Robinsons situation where you change one little detail, like whether \nthe kid catches the ball in the baseball game, and then it changes history \ndramatically.\n\nChanging a detail like removing Hitler from the 1930s Germany situation \nmight change the course of world history, but it doesn't necessarily mean \nthat it will be awful or even entirely different. Germans were looking for \nsomeone to blame for their hardships. History would definitely be \ndifferent. But I don't think it would necessarily be THAT different.
