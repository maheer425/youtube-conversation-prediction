The mystery of the ocean and the uncertainty \nof a mysterious killer shark surrounding them as Quint delivers one of the \nmost horrific but lesser known stories in WWII. Even as a kid, I remembered \nand understood every single word said. I couldn't take my eyes off the \nscreen. This was the scene that gave me nightmares of sharks swimming in my \nroom, hunting me down with nothing but the veil of my blanket keeping me \nsafe. My father always taught me to respect the ocean and to this day I \nstill do. Jaws gave me that more than the fear itself. It made me fear the \nocean but did it respectably. It was a fear that was and is well deserved. \nThe ocean is a beautiful place but also a place of unpredictability. This \nmovie was a horror film of the highest caliber because it presented you \nwith a situation that wasn't over the top stupid nor did it treat the \naudience like brainless idiots, but gave you a problem that was very real \nand very possible. The greatest movie of all time in my opinion. Spielberg \nwent through hell to make it, but managed to make it pay off timelessly. \nForever will he be indebted to this film for making him the big time \ndirector he is today.\ufeff",
