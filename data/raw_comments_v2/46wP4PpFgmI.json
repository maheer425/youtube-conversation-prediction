Of course \npeople will disagree with me, but i know you can drift with no problems \nwith a turbo car, of course! But i honestly prefer a really powerful v8 \nthan an twin turbo 2jz. Personally i love the sound of a 2jz, its a total \neargasm. But turbos have lag. Of course antilag, still my answer would be a \nv8 with lots of torque for isntant power. I am not a v8 fanboy or anything. \nJust my opinion, hope you guys can be respectful.\ufeff",

A \nreal drifter knows that.
