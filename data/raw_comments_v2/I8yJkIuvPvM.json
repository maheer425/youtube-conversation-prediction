Rather than going to church and hearing it from someone \nelse, you can decide to do your own research, and you'll find that what \nyou're hearing isn't necessarily fact. Additionally, if the Christian god \nis the creator of the universe and Jesus is his son, then why would he let \nyou people continue to destroy the earth in the ways you do. Rather than \ncherish his great gift, religious Christians waste and destroy so much in \nan attempt to change others and make the world a better place for humans \n(and the population is spiraling out of control).
