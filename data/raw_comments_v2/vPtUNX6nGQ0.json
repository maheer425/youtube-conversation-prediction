Paralegal: Requires at minimum \na 2 year degree, and a pretty decent knowledge of the law and it's \nprocesses, THEY, can only work in the office of a Lawyer. Cop: at max 6 \nmonths, and on average 3 months of Academy Training has hardly NO knowledge \nof the law, or constitutional rights, and after merely 3 months of \ntraining, equivalent to less than a single college semester can: detain, \narrest, charge, apprehend, mace, taze, shoot, pursue, chase, tackle, beat, \nhandcuff, admit, search, seize personal property unlawfully, and \nessentially dictate and determine the entire outcome of someones life, \nability to get into a decent college, get a loan, get hired by a decent \njob, affect their ability to enter into the military, or the medical field, \nor the field or study of law, all with the swipe of their pen.. People, \nthis is way too much leeway and reach for any ONE person to have over \nanother human beings life. Yes even judges. For one old man in a funny robe \n(who is often corrupt also) to dictate the ENTIRE outcome of another \npersons life, it's downright silly, the whole Judaical System needs to be \ntorn down, revamped and completely restructured from the ground up. Cops \nneed to earn pistols after a certain number of years complaint free, like \n5+. And after their issuance, they should only be allowed to shoot at the \nlegs of moving targets ONLY, if you can't shoot at the legs of moving \ntargets WHILE moving yourself just as brand new graduates of Army or Marine \nboot-camp can, another year you wait. Internal Affairs needs to be \ncomprised of local citizens from the offending cops immediate area of \noperations. Thus he will be judged and punished accordingly by the very \npeople he has been interacting with. Just like jury duty, just about the \nsame. Any cop who moves first to a gun, and not the: MACE, PEPPER SPRAY, \nBATON, or TASER that they also have is fired. Every cop wears a body-cam, \nEVERYONE. Undercover work is all but disbanded and branded illegal unless \nit's to catch pedophiles or rapists. Any gaps or delays in footage results \nin immediate termination. Any muting of body cams results in immediate \ntermination. People, it does not take a rocket scientists to come up with \nlogical and prevalent solutions.\ufeff",
