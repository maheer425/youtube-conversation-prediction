Conjugations \ndeal only with the varying forms of Verbs. Elsewhere, they are Word \nDeclensions, which are governed by Grammatical Gender and Case. Both \"You\" \nand \"Thou\" have their own Declensions. As in \"Thou\" being Nominative, \nwhereas - modernly - \"Thee\" serves both Accusatively and Datively (from \naccusative \"\u00feec\" and dative \"\u00fe\u00e9\").\n\nFor pertainant information and future reference I have here the histories \nof both words with some tid-bits:\n\nYou:\nAnglo-Saxon (Old English) \u0113ow, \u012bow [dialectial], which is the Dative \nDeclension of \"\u0121\u0113\", Modern \"Ye\". English being a Western Germanic language, \n\u0113ow descended from a Western Form of Proto-Germanic, \"izwis\" giving, \n\"iwwiz\" [ju:wiz/ju:wis] which was the Dative Declension of Western \nProto-Germanic, \"j\u012bz\" which descended from an earlier, \"j\u016bz\". This latter \nword, being \"You-Plural or You-Formal\", was eventually birthed from the \nProto-Indo-European root, \"y\u016bs\". Ye is the Nominative Plural of \"Thou\".\n\nThe Full Declension of Ye is as follows:\nNominative: \u0121\u0113\nAccusative: \u0113owic [cognate to German, Euch], \u0113ow\nGenitive: \u0113ower (Modern, Your)\nDative: \u0113ow\n\nThou:\nAnglo-Saxon (Old English) \u00fe\u00fa (You-Singular(-Informal)). This descended from \nProto-Germanic, \"\u00fe\u00fa\" (Gothic: \u00feu, Old Saxon & Old Frisian & Old Dutch: th\u016b, \nOld High German: d\u016b, Germand & Dutch: du, Old Norse & Icelandic: \u00fe\u00fa, \nFaroese: t\u00fa, Swedish & Danish & Norwegian: du, et al.) \nThis PGmc word came from the Proto-Indo-European root, \"t\u00fah2\" (Albanian: \nti, Irish: t\u00fa, Scots G\u00e6lic: thu, Ancient Greek: s\u00fa, Sanskrit: tv\u00e1m. \nBengali: tumi, Hindi & Urdu: tum, Kurmanji Kurdish: tu, Old Persian: tuvam, \nFarsi: tu, Pashto: t\u00eb, Latin: t\u016b, et al.)\n\nThe Full Declension of Thou is as follows:\nNominative: \u00fe\u00fa\nAccusative: \u00fe\u00e9\u010b (Modern, Thee)\nGenitive: \u00fe\u00edn (Modern, Thine & Thy)\nDative: \u00fe\u00e9 (Modern, Thee)\n\nThere also existed Dual Forms (Indicating use by or for only two persons) \nthat are no longer in use.\n\nNom: \u0121it\nAcc: in\u010bit, inc\nGen: in\u010ber\nDat: in\u010b\n\nInterestingly enough, with i > u; in some cases through-out Middle English \n(bisig > busy), probable Modern forms of these could be: Yut, Unk, Unker & \nUnk.

I'm not sure what you're getting \nat with \"twerk\" but that joke plays on the tendency to strongly reduce the \nvowel in the word \"to\".\n\nThe Thorn rune represented a voiceless dental fricative in Old English, Old \nNorse, Proto-Norse and even Proto-Germanic (we think). Sound changes in \nmost West Germanic languages (e.g. German, Dutch) resulted in a modern [d] \n(e.g. DE/NL: \"danken\" versus EN: \"thank\") while in most North Germanic \nlanguages the modern sound is (usually) [t\u02b0] (cognate in NO/DK: \"takk\" SV: \n\"tack\"). Icelandic, like English, preserves the fricative [\u03b8], and in their \ncase, the spelling with\u3008\u00fe\u3009(cognate in IS: \"\u00feakka\"). The fricative is the \nolder sound in Germanic languages: it underwent fortition to [t\u02b0], and \nthen, in continental West Germanic languages, sonorization to [d].\n\nThe pesky Normans actually would have used a stop (something like [t]) for \nanything spelt \u3008th\u3009 (e.g. modern FR: \"th\u00e9\u00e2tre\"). This is because it \ndescended from Latin, which used a \u3008TH\u3009 digraph to represent [t\u02b0] in, \noriginally, words borrowed from Greek (cognate in LA: \"THEATRUM\", EL: \n\"\u03b8\u03b5\u03ac\u03c4\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd\"). I wouldn't like to make a definite statement here, but I don't \nthink any Romance language has ever used /\u03b8/.\n\nThe spelling \u3008th\u3009for [\u03b8] in English derives from the changes in Greek \nphonology: when Greek [t\u02b0] lenited to [\u03b8] (the opposite of what happened in \nGermanic languages), the Latin digraph suddenly made sense as a \nrepresentation of Germanic [\u03b8] as well.\n\nThis was a bit long, and possibly a bit involved, so in summary: \ncontemporary North Germanic languages used dental fricative [\u03b8] and \nrepresented this with the rune Thorn. When the Latinised Thorn was \nintroduced in Old English, it represented the same sound. And the Normans \nhad nothing to do with it.",
