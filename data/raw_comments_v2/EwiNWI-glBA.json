It has a very spring-ly feel and it's almost kind of \na calming relaxing song, despite its sad lyrics. Many people have said that \nthe rap doesn't fit, but I think it fits very well. His voice is a contrast \nto Raina's and it's nice to listen to. And this is my opinion, so I \nunderstand if you do not agree with it. Aside all that, this song is one of \nmy all time favorites, and Raina has been doing well since her solo debut. \nFighting!\ufeff",

I always say that After School is the most underrated \ngroup in K-pop but I'd like to focus on Raina here, since it's her song. As \nexpected, I love this. Raina's sweet singing voice and Kanto's rough rap \nare a perfect combination. I really like how the song is put in the form of \na conversation between the man who is leaving and the girl who is so \nshocked and hurt that she turns to denial. The lyrics are beautiful and \nsorrowful with Raina's part being especially heartbreaking. The video is \nalso nice, showing Raina going to meet her lover mixed with scenes of the \ncouple's happy past memories. And as always, Raina looks lovely with her \nflawless skin and long legs. Raina hwaiting! <3\ufeff",
