The demand is men wanting sex.  The \nsupply is women willing to have sex.  Yet, instead of men treating other \nhuman beings with respect and governing themselves, men forcefully steal \nyoung women and then sell them so that they can supply the demand of the \nsex trade.\nWhere does your voluntarism work?  Who is going to volunteer to challenge \nwith their time and money to eradicate prostitution and slavery?  \n\nWhy do I believe roads would be different? How about standards. When the \nrailroad industry didn't have any standards, almost every set of tracks was \nmade to the owner's specifications, meaning that that trains weren't \ncompatible with multiple tracks.  Eventually standards were written to \ncoordinate tracks to be common sizes.\nRoads are the same way.  If you don't have standards on everything from \nwidth to material to speeds (ranges), you'd be driving along and every area \nwould change the way they would build, maintain and replace their roads. \n Land owners would place tolls when you came near their property.\n\nLaw Enforcement becoming goon squads?

            "text": "First of all, I know not a single anarchist who doesn't vehemently oppose \ngenital mutilation. They may exist but, if so, I don't want to know them.\n\nSecond of all, many differences in production stem from differences in \nenvironmental and historical conditions. When a farmer has only half the \nproduce compared to another because the soil is less fertile or gets less \nrain is it hir fault?\n\nThird of all, Socialism as a word means very little today as everyone from \nneoliberals to revolutionary Anarchists use the term. State-Socialism, as \nyou are most familiar with from your Ukrainian history, can just as well be \ncalled State-Capitalism as the means of production, in that case, are still \nnot in the hands of the working class. It is just as far from Communism as \nnormal Capitalism, maybe even farther.\n\nFourth of all, I vehemently oppose the idea that I or anyone else can \n\"mechanically direct the 'animal spirits' of humans in a useful Socialist \ndirection.\" This Marxist-Leninist dogma has only led to horrors such as the \nmany crimes against humanity of Stalin, Mao, and the Kim family. I believe \nhumans are naturally already capable of voluntary co-operation and mutual \naid. I believe that my only role, as an Anarchist, is to let people know \nthat there are other ideas next to neo-liberalism. Basically it comes close \nto the saying: \"One can lead a horse to water but one can't make hir \ndrink.\" Marxist-Leninist dogma (and the ideologies derived from it such as \nStalinism) think that you need to force the horse to water and then push \nhis head into the water, if the horse resists to much you shoot hir. I, and \nother Anarchists I know and have read, believe that we can lead the horse \nto water but that the horse has to make hir own decision.\n\nAbout states, I believe that states will always become corrupt but, more \nimportantly, that they have corrupted society. I believe Humanity can do \nwithout an organization which constantly forces us to do and think what it \nwants us to do and think. Instead, I believe Humans have the natural \ncapacity to come together in voluntary organization in order to solve \nproblems.\n\nAnother thing, Communism means the abolition of money as a whole. The \nguiding idea is \"to produce as you can and take what you need.\" There \nshould be a minor addendum into this rule as we have gained the technology \nto produce way more than we (the entire Human species) need. Nevertheless, \nthis doctrine epitomizes an understanding of objective differences in \nhumans. I, at this moment, do not need insulin-injections to survive and \nthus do not need to take it. Others do and are, under this Communist ideal, \nallowed to take as much insulin as they need. This doesn't mean that I \nshould be forced to take an insulin shot in order to force some kind of \nequality.\n\nTo continue on production, I already stated that we have gained the \ntechnological capacity to produce more than the Human species need. The \nneeds of the Human species are however, at the moment, artificially \ninflated because of the consumerist society. Cell phones which should be \nable to be used for a decade are discarded practically from the box. Cars \nare often replaced within about three years even though they can still \ndrive for hundreds of thousands of kilometres. Moreover, many consumer \ngoods are designed with planned obsolescence. Take away this consumerism \nwhich has been artificially and carefully created over the past century and \nwe can live with relatively little labour per person. Many Anarchists \nbelieve that, instead of forcing people into a hyper-regimented lifestyle \nas now, our labour should be a form of creative play. This is what I \nconsider to be socialized labour, where we have control over the means of \nproduction ourselves and perform our labour not as a chore but as a social \nprocess with others. Something that is made virtually impossible in modern \nsociety.\n\nIn short, you have assumed that I want enforced equality through wages \nwhereas I want to abolish wages altogether and embrace a Communist society. \nYou have assumed that I want to force people into this society whereas I \nbelieve people need to reach conclusions about society on their own and I \ncan only show them that these ideologies exist. It is fine with me if some \ngroups decide to go for Mutualism (see Proudhon), others for Collectivism \n(see Bakunin), yet others for Communism (see Kropotkin), and yet others for \nanother variety as yet unimagined. The most important thing is that a \nchange in social and societal relations is absolutely necessary because \nCapitalism and the States are only bringing us misery. You mentioned you \nare from the Ukraine, from what I gathered one of the factors in the \ncurrent turmoil was a trade-agreement that the EU was forcing onto the \ncountry. This is absolutely necessary for Capitalism to lengthen its \nlifetime because European and American Capital needs to be dumped \nelsewhere. These, and similar acts by the EU/USA are very close to what \nhappened in the Scramble for Africa. The necessity of Capital to dump its \noverflow was already noted by Marx in Capital.\n\nPS. I have mentioned several times that other Anarchists have similar views \non certain topics. I must note that I cannot speak for other Anarchists and \ncan only explain that certain viewpoints are also held by others within the \nmovement. Anarchism is, however, too broad for me to authoritatively speak \nabout any official dogmas or party lines because they simply don't exist. \nThere are about as many Anarchisms as there are Anarchists. The only thing \nthat defines all Anarchists is a belief that the State must be abolished.",

            "text": "+Hadrian Ferran\n Well this is exactly true. I have taken objective differences and make \nthem subjectively important, because that is my prerogative. Facts are \nfacts, unless you can use Leftist logic and convolute them with \nanti-rationalism.\n \nIndeed that is exactly what you have committed! You believe that one hour \nof my life is worth one hour of your life. What is the criteria? As two \nhuman beings, this is true pertaining to their human value. I am not worth \nmore than you. It is why Conservatives scream about the mutilation of, or \nthe abuse of, young Muslim girls while relativist Leftists are silent. They \ndo not deal in the value of life or the individual, but instead equivocate \nthe idea, the ideology, the religion as equal. I am not interested in what \nanyone thinks their work is worth. I worry about their value as an \nindividual. Leftists do this with minimum wage. Well if that entry level \ntraining job is now the normal life-style or career, and their work is \nworth $15/hour, then what is the value of the time of someone who \npreviously made $15/hour? Or the person who made $20? In the Soviet Union \nwe all made $20 a month, though our efforts were not equal. Our mental \nabilities were not equal. Every citizen knew this phrase: \u201cI will pretend \nto work as long as you pretend to pay me!\u201d I think the American version you \naspire to would be: \u201cI will pretend to work, as long as you are willing to \npay me anyway!\u201d Why? Because how do you assure equal effort, even when \naccepting different results?\n \nPutin may work harder than Prime Minister Harper, but the value and intent \nof their work is completely different, rendering this egalitarian \nperspective of equal work as a total fallacy. Two people are farmers. One \nproduces twice as much food. This farmer feeds twice as many people. Yet \none is inefficient and makes bad choices about seed, planting, and \nfertilizer. The first plants after a large rain and produces more. His \nchoices have benefited not only himself but mankind in general, unless you \nare a liberal eugenicist like John Holdren of course. Perhaps his \ninitiative will influence observers in the next season? But you would have \nme perceive their effort as equal. If George Bush and Barack Obama put in \nequal hours, which is far from true, would you perceive them equals \npolitically or in measuring your accepted social results? Now we have two \nscientists, one of whom creates a cure for ebola. He has devoted 10,000 \nhours of research to find a cure. Another scientist devotes 10,000 hours to \nfinding a higher impact plastic explosive. Hey, as you said, equal value, \nequal gain for their common effort.\n \n\u201cSo we both have equal ability to make decisions over that body\u201d? And what \nof two people, one who has never smoked, and one who smokes six packs a \nday? Were their abilities to \u201cchoose\u201d equal? Should they be guaranteed \nequal results? Maybe the government can do it for them? Natural Authority! \nYes, I believe in it. But natural authority gives us that equal right to \nchoose, not to be led. You seem to perceive natural authority for equal \nresults.\n \nYour foundation for egalitarianism is contrived from your need to validate \nyour ideology. You don\u2019t like the outcome, so you will prove the process is \nunfair! That reminds me of Michael Mann, Maurice Strong, and Dr. Phil Jones \nin the Hockey Stick Theory. Mann had a theory and he was going to prove it \nwas right! He measured tree rings. He theorized the earth had warmed 0.01 \ndegrees per year for 150 years. The tree rings and temps didn\u2019t match so \nthey destroyed the data at East Anglia and faked data. Well in truth it \nwasn\u2019t necessary. Their research showed no data for precipitation and \nhydrology! Perhaps then, though I am not assured, they could have proved \ntheir point if they had followed the Scientific Theory.\n \nChildren of a lesser god! I ask you to set aside the relativist perspective \nfor a moment. I would ask you is it fair that a young lady is born into a \nMuslim family in north Africa that mutilates her genitals and sells her for \na camel? Then you have a spoiled brat in America born with a silver spoon? \nWhat natural authority does the Muslim girl have, and will that \ncircumstance determine her fate at all, rather than her natural authority? \nLife is not fair, and government can\u2019t make it fair. And in my opinion when \nsomething is given cheaply, like a trophy for participation, or money for \nsitting on your ass, you have cheapened the soul to the point where that \nhour of labor or effort become irrelevant. I have lived much of my life in \nUkraine, Melitopol, Zaporozhye Oblast not far very from Donetsk. We know \nwell that Socialism does not raise the basement, it crashes the ceiling. As \na result, egalitarianism is achieved. That being equal misery. There is no \nother outcome. And the evidence is universal and all around. That is \nempirical evidence. When one disqualifies reason for emotive \nanti-rationalism, you are not a sociologist as Emile Durkheim and Marx \npretended to be. Instead they are a Michael Mann, with a set of mental \ntools defying that natural authority of mankind.\n \nYou would have me believe the pie is static in size. If so, why do people \never have more luxury, better health conditions, well until people who are \nborn to a lesser god come here to participate in the spoils of Capitalism \nwithout a thought to the oppressive rich! Maybe our evil system can cure \ntheir scabies, tuberculosis, and ebola? What I do not accept is the same \nthing you hold in contempt, that being a government which cheats, and can \nbe bought by any special interest. Isn\u2019t that what happened when the Health \nInsurance Industry was first castigated, threatened, and then brought into \nthe White House for a special deal, that being increased previously \u201cevil\u201d \nprofits from the new AFA healthcare bill? Suddenly they were compliant, \njust as Mussolini predicted in 1922. That is the evil of government, and it \nis not unique to one party or one ideology. It is systemic! And you vote it \nout, you adhere to the Constitution, and return powers to the State rather \nthan fulfill Wilson\u2019s dream of centralized control which as Mussolini \npredicted, would afford him corruption. Is it any wonder that the \u201cun \nfasci\u201d were the 3 communist labor unions in Italy circa 1908? Yes it \neventually morphed into Fascism instead of communism, but before then they \nwere known as \u201cthe syndicate\u201d, after the syndicalist labor movement. Soon \npost 1915 that name laterally became the nickname of the Mafia. Why would \nthat be?\n \nWe have two different perspectives. You believe in a more robust Elitist \nperspective that you, a great man among lesser men, can mechanically direct \nthe \u201canimal spirits\u201d of humans in a useful Socialist direction. I like, \nIvan Pavlov, do not consider human beings to be trained dogs. This \nAdministration does!\n\nThis is my last post. I don't have time. I have two capitalist jobs.",

Build those windmills over there by the little people, don't build a \ncharitable half-way house behind my condo!\" She said to me, and I quote, \"I \nshouldn't have to look at them!\" That is the liberal elite in a nutshell! \nWe believe in a safety net, but we don't look down our long noses at the \npeople we serve.\n\nAnd we do not expect your results to be the same as mine.
