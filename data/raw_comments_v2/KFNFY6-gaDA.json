LONG PARAGRAPH BUT IM BORED \nLEAVE ME ALONE XD btw i would say cait is easier to play just cause her ult \nis locked xP but i would choose Jinx if you like playing really aggressive \nand good chasing abilitys also running away and for cait i play more of a \nstay in the BACK and just do damage in teamfights cait is also aggressive \ncause her long auto attacks and cait has high damage in 1v1 since her \npassive.",

Long \nrange, good damage, escape utility, wave clear, and synergy with your \nsupport to get your traps off behind them for an easy stun. She does not \ncarry as hard as Vayne in the late game, however early/mid game she is a \nmonster. And when topped with a good support, you can win nearly any \nmatchup through poking with her insane range. Cait is consistent, Vayne is \na powerhouse that can snowball completely out of control if she gets ahead, \nhowever it requires you be very skilled to pull off good Condemns and \nTumbles.",
