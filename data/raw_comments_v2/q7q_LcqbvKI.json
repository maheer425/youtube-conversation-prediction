            "text": "Allah says in Quran [different verses from Quran] about Hajj :\n[Quran 22:27] \"And proclaim that the people shall observe Hajj pilgrimage. \nThey will come to you walking or riding on various exhausted (means of \ntransportation). They will come from the farthest locations.\"\n[Quran 2:125] We have rendered the shrine (the Kaba) a focal point for the \npeople, and a safe sanctuary. You may use Abraham's shrine as a prayer \nhouse. We commissioned Abraham and Ismail: \"You shall purify My house for \nthose who visit, those who live there, and those who bow and prostrate.\"\n[Quran 2:158] The knolls of Safa and Marwah are among the rites decreed by \nGod. Anyone who observes Hajj or `Umrah commits no error by traversing the \ndistance between them. If one volunteers more righteous works, then God is \nAppreciative, Omniscient.\n[Quran 2:189] They ask you about the phases of the moon! Say, \"They provide \na timing device for the people, and determine the time of Hajj.\" It is not \nrighteous to beat around the bush; righteousness is attained by upholding \nthe commandments and by being straightforward. You shall observe God, that \nyou may succeed.\n[ 2:196] You shall observe the complete rites of Hajj and `Umrah for God. \nIf you are prevented, you shall send an offering, and do not resume cutting \nyour hair until your offering has reached its destination. If you are ill, \nor suffering a head injury (and you must cut your hair), you shall expiate \nby fasting, or giving to charity, or some other form of worship. During the \nnormal Hajj, if you break the state of Ihram (sanctity) between `Umrah and \nHajj, you shall expiate by offering an animal sacrifice. If you cannot \nafford it, you shall fast three days during Hajj and seven when you return \nhome - this completes ten -provided you do not live at the Sacred Masjid. \nYou shall observe God, and know that God is strict in enforcing retribution.\n[Quran 2:197] Hajj shall be observed in the specified months. Whoever sets \nout to observe Hajj shall refrain from sexual intercourse, misconduct, and \narguments throughout Hajj. Whatever good you do, God is fully aware \nthereof. As you prepare your provisions for the journey, the best provision \nis righteousness. You shall observe Me, O you who possess intelligence.\n[Quran 2:198] You commit no error by seeking provisions from your Lord \n(through commerce). When you file from `Arafaat, you shall commemorate God \nat the Sacred Location (of Muzdalifah). You shall commemorate Him for \nguiding you; before this, you had gone astray. [Quran 2:199] You shall file \ntogether, with the rest of the people who file, and ask God for \nforgiveness. God is Forgiver, Most Merciful.\n[Quran 2:200-201] Once you complete your rites, you shall continue to \ncommemorate God as you commemorate your own parents, or even better. Some \npeople would say, \"Our Lord, give us of this world,\" while having no share \nin the Hereafter. [Quran 2:201] Others would say, \"Our Lord, grant us \nrighteousness in this world, and righteousness in the Hereafter, and spare \nus the retribution of Hell.\"\n[Quran 2:203] You shall commemorate God for a number of days (in Mena); \nwhoever hastens to do this in two days commits no sin, and whoever stays \nlonger commits no sin, so long as righteousness is maintained. You shall \nobserve God, and know that before Him you will be gathered.\n[Quran 3:96-97] The most important shrine established for the people is the \none in Becca; a blessed beacon for all the people. In it are clear signs: \nthe station of Abraham. Anyone who enters it shall be granted safe passage. \nThe people owe it to God that they shall observe Hajj to this shrine, when \nthey can afford it. As for those who disbelieve, God does not need anyone.\n[Quran 5:1] O you who believe, you shall fulfill your covenants. Permitted \nfor you to eat are the livestock, except those specifically prohibited \nherein. You shall not permit hunting throughout Hajj pilgrimage. God \ndecrees whatever He wills. \n[Quran 5:2] O you who believe, do not violate the rites instituted by God, \nnor the Sacred Months, nor the animals to be offered, nor the garlands \nmarking them, nor the people who head for the Sacred Shrine (Ka'ba) seeking \nblessings from their Lord and approval. Once you complete the pilgrimage, \nyou may hunt. Do not be provoked into aggression by your hatred of people \nwho once prevented you from going to the Sacred Masjid. You shall cooperate \nin matters of righteousness and piety; do not cooperate in matters that are \nsinful and evil. You shall observe God. God is strict in enforcing \nretribution.\n[Quran 5:94] O you who believe, God will test you with some game within \nreach of your hands and your arrows (during pilgrimage). God thus \ndistinguishes those among you who observe Him in their privacy. Those who \ntransgress after this have incurred a painful retribution.\n[Quran 5:95] O you who believe, do not kill any game during pilgrimage. \nAnyone who kills any game on purpose, his fine shall be a number of \nlivestock animals that is equivalent to the game animals he killed. The \njudgment shall be set by two equitable people among you. They shall make \nsure that the offerings reach the Ka'ba. Otherwise, he may expiate by \nfeeding poor people, or by an equivalent fast to atone for his offense. God \nhas pardoned past offenses. But if anyone returns to such an offense, God \nwill avenge it. God is Almighty, Avenger. \n[Quran 5:96] All fish of the sea are made lawful for you to eat. During \npilgrimage, this may provide for you during your journey. You shall not \nhunt throughout the pilgrimage. You shall reverence God, before whom you \nwill be summoned.\n[Quran 9:2] Therefore, roam the earth freely for four months, and know that \nyou cannot escape from God, and that God humiliates the disbelievers.\n[Quran 9:36] The count of months, as far as God is concerned, is twelve. \nThis has been God's law, since the day He created the heavens and the \nearth. Four of them are sacred. This is the perfect religion; you shall not \nwrong your souls (by fighting) during the Sacred Months. However, you may \ndeclare all-out war against the idol worshipers (even during the Sacred \nMonths), when they declare all-out war against you, and know that God is on \nthe side of the righteous.\n[Quran 9:37] Altering the Sacred Months is a sign of excessive disbelief; \nit augments the straying of those who have disbelieved. They alternate the \nSacred Months and the regular months, while preserving the number of months \nconsecrated by God. They thus violate what God has consecrated. Their evil \nworks are adorned in their eyes. God does not guide the disbelieving \npeople. [Quran 22:26-27] We appointed Abraham to establish the Shrine: \"You \nshall not idolize any other god beside Me, and purify My shrine for those \nwho visit it, those who live near it, and those who bow and prostrate.\" And \nproclaim that the people shall observe Hajj pilgrimage. They will come to \nyou walking or riding on various exhausted (means of transportation). They \nwill come from the farthest locations.\"\n[Quran 22:28-29] They may seek commercial benefits, and they shall \ncommemorate God's name during the specified days for providing them with \nlivestock. \"Eat therefrom and feed the despondent and the poor.\" They shall \ncomplete their obligations, fulfill their vows, and visit the ancient \nshrine.\n[Quran 22:33] The (livestock) provide you with many benefits for a period, \nbefore being donated to the ancient shrine.\n[Quran 22:36] The animal offerings are among the rites decreed by God for \nyour own good. You shall mention God's name on them while they are standing \nin line. Once they are offered for sacrifice, you shall eat therefrom and \nfeed the poor and the needy. This is why we subdued them for you, that you \nmay show your appreciation.\n[Quran 48:27] God has fulfilled His messenger's truthful vision: \"You will \nenter the Sacred Masjid, God willing, perfectly secure, and you will cut \nyour hair or shorten it (as you fulfill the pilgrimage rituals) there. You \nwill not have any fear. Since He knew what you did not know, He has coupled \nthis with an immediate victory.\"\ufeff",

No other religion teaches the depth or \nseriousness of sin and its consequences. No other religion offers the \ninfinite payment of sin that only Jesus Christ could provide. No other \n\u201creligious founder\u201d was God become man (John 1:1,14) \u2013 the only way an \ninfinite debt could be paid. Jesus had to be God so that He could pay our \ndebt. Jesus had to be man so He could die. Salvation is available only \nthrough faith in Jesus Christ! \u201cSalvation is found in NO ONE ELSE, for \nthere is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved\u201d \n(Acts 4:12). Chose your path, but ask your self, what happens with my \nconscious being after by body dies? That should get you thinking.\n\n\nI WILL NOT reply to any comments and I disabled notification for this \nthread. Have a good day believers.\n\n\n******************PS******************\nThe Following is only applicable to believers as monkeys and bigbangs don't \napply here:\n\nHistorically speaking Islam and Christians (used to be Jews)(Followers in \nChrists footsteps, NOT carriers of the word Christian) ARE BROTHERS thru \nIbrahim but not thru belief system. :D dont believe me read the Koran and \nthe Bible. Ive read both numerous of times. (Korans - The Women 4:171) VS \n(2* Bibles John 3:16 and 3* 1st John 2:22)\n\nKorans - The Women 4:171\n\"O People of the Scripture, do not commit excess in your religion or say \nabout Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but \na messenger of Allah and His word which He directed to Mary and a soul \n[created at a command] from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers. \nAnd do not say, \"Three\"; desist - it is better for you. Indeed, Allah is \nbut one God. Exalted is He above having a son. To Him belongs whatever is \nin the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And sufficient is Allah as \nDisposer of affairs.\"\n\nBibles - John 3:16\n\" For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that \nwhoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life\"\nBibles - 1st John 2:22\n\"Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a \nperson is the antichrist\u2014denying the Father and the Son.\"\n\nTo understand as Koran and Bible say there is one God, you have to \nunderstand  tha one God is like one family which can have many \nsons/daughters care takers. There is only one USA or France or Africa but \nthere are many people under that name.\n\nAGAIN I say these are our beliefs (Muslim/Christian) there should be no \nwars or deaths, tortures over this, this is just what we believe in, be it \nAtheists, Scientism, Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism or God forbid \nsatanism(somewhere in the corner lol. I see no normal human being ever \nconsidering this option), I already solidly stated what I believe.\n\nStay safe and spread good all around you, lets not give evil room to \nbreathe my brothers/sisters, fellow believers and friends.

God says:\n\n\u201cLet there be no compulsion in religion.  Truth has been made clear from \nerror.  Whoever rejects false worship and believes in God has grasped the \nmost trustworthy handhold that never breaks.  And God hears and knows all \nthings.\u201d (Quran 2:256)\nGod says:\n\n\u201cIf it had been your Lord\u2019s will, all of the people on Earth would have \nbelieved.  Would you then compel the people so to have them believe?\u201d \n(Quran 10:99)\nGod says:\n\n\u201cSo if they dispute with you, say \u2018I have submitted my whole self to God, \nand so have those who follow me.\u2019  And say to the People of the Scripture \nand to the unlearned: \u2018Do you also submit yourselves?\u2019  If they do, then \nthey are on right guidance.  But if they turn away, your duty is only to \nconvey the Message.  And in God\u2019s sight are all of His servants.\u201d (Quran \n3:20)\nGod says:\n\n\u201cThe Messenger\u2019s duty is but to proclaim the Message.\u201d (Quran 5:99)\n\n\n\nJihad means to STURGGLE not holy war. The best of Jihad is to hold our \nanger back and struggle through lusts and desires.\n\n\nKAFIR is not something that u think. It doesnt mean Infidel AT ALL>\nkafir means just disbelievers. i am not saying u a dirty kafir or \nsomething. its not a bad word.\n\nThe most important thing to note:\n\nISIS do not represent Islam.\nThere r 26,000 members of ISIS according to non-muslims sources.\nwht about KKK? they were over 5 million!\nthere r many fake videos too.\nThey are somehow friend of mainstream MEDIA>\nMedia knows how to edit videos to make Islam look Bad.\n\n\n(sura 109)\nSay,  \"O  disbelievers,\nI  do  not  worship  what  you  worship.\nNor  are  you  worshippers  of  what  I  worship.\nNor  will  I  be  a  worshipper  of  what  you  worship.\nNor  will  you  be  worshippers  of  what  I  worship.\nFor  you  is  your  religion,  and  for  me  is  my  religion.\"",

It's selective justification. Also, I'm familiar with the \n'scientific discoveries' within the quran, it's totally blown out of \nproportion, people say that to make the quran look more legitimate, but \nthere is nothing about science within the quran that wasn't already \ndiscovered by the greeks.

I know more about your religion than you can imagine. \nFine, here is a part  of your quran:\nEVIDENCE THAT QURAN WANTS UNBELIEVERS DEAD PLEASE SEE BELOW\nThose that the Muslims killed were not really killed by them. It was Allah \nwho did the killing. 8:17\nSlay the idolaters wherever you find them. 9:5\nSmite the necks of the disbelievers whenever you fight against them. Those \nwho die fighting for Allah will be rewarded. 47:4\nRemember thy Lord inspired the angels (with the message): \"I am with you: \ngive firmness to the Believers: I will instill terror into the hearts of \nthe Unbelievers: smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger-tips \noff them.\"\nQur'an 8:12\nKill disbelievers wherever you find them. If they attack you, then kill \nthem. Such is the reward of disbelievers. (But if they desist in their \nunbelief, then don't kill them.) 2:191-2\nAllah says that you must keep fighting until there is no more persecution \nand everyone on earth is a Muslim.

Allah will keep them \nalive so that he can torture them forever. When they repent and ask for \nmercy, he will ignore them.\n35:36-7\nAllah has blinded the disbelievers so that they cannot see the truth. So it \ndon't bother warning them. They will go to hell anyway. 36:8-10\nDon't let the disbelievers think they can escape. They are your enemy and \nthe enemy of Allah. 8:59-60\nIf someone murders your slave, then you get to kill one of his. If it was a \nmale that was killed, you kill one of the killer's male slaves. If a \nfemale, you kill a female. Murder for murder. Slave for slave. It all works \nout swell with Allah's wondrous rules. (Oh, and if you don't follow them, \nyou'll have the usual painful doom.) 2:178",

The only preference in the \neyes of God is piety as stated in the Quran: \"The best amongst you in the \neyes of God is most righteous.\"\n\nThe Hajj is a reminder of the Grand Assembly on the Day of Judgment when \npeople will stand equal before God waiting for their final destiny, and as \nthe Prophet Muhammad said, \"God does not judge according to your bodies and \nappearances, but he scans your hearts and looks into your deeds.\"\n\nWhile Malcolm X was in Mecca performing his pilgrimage, he wrote to his \nassistants: \"They asked me what about the Hajj had impressed me the most. . \n. . I said, `The brotherhood! The people of all races, colors, from all \nover the world coming together as one! It has proved to me the power of the \nOne God.' . . . All ate as one, and slept as one. Everything about the \npilgrimage atmosphere accented the oneness of man under one God.\"\n\nThis is what the Hajj is all about.\n\n* By  Ahmad Al-Akhras, CAIRO\ufeff",
