It could be its autobiographical nature, that avoids the vapidity \nof your average chick-lit novel, OR it could be the periodical \nphilosophical introspection that interlude the story's progression, or it \ncould be both? I think it is both.\n\nI love this book, I enjoyed it immensely- all of the \"characters\" aroused a \nsubtle reminder to find meaning in everyday life. AND...the moral of the \nstory? Ironically is, \"No one can save you, but yourself, and don't you \nforget it!\" I love this book, I love it most of all because it doesn't \nexpect women to just be satisfied with glittery, pinkness. Lena Mikado if \nyou please, lead the rainbow parade of woman pride, into the turquoise \nwaters so that we can all find our ocean!\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Journey-Ocean-Colors-Rainbow-Book-ebook/dp/B00QI89NW4/ref=sr_1_1?tag=geolinker-20&ie=UTF8\n\ufeff",
