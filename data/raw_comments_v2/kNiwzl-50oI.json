Be sure your do not \nget it anywhere you do not want it, i.e, the black paint band around the \nwindow.  If we have to remove the trademark we typically take a small \namount of Tidy Bowl on a q-tip and lightly brush it on.  wait a minute, \nbecause that paint is fired in on a furnace.  Then, take a razor blade and \nscrape it off.  HOWEVER, this can void your windshield's warranty IF the \ntrademark is not printed on the window under the window channel (most are). \n Another good tip for removing scratches is 6,000 grit sandpaper, or even \nsteel wool.  There are many other tricks of the trade from a manufacturing \npoint of view, but if you find your trademark is worn, or you find it \nunsightly, there is a way to remove it.\ufeff",
