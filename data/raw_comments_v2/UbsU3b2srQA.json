Even if you feel like you have given up \nand life will never have hope again, it is still there.  Christ is eternal \nand He has felt all of our pains and sorrows and disappointments.  His \narms remain outstretched to comfort and heal us, no matter how hard the \nroad may be.  It is never too late to reach out to Him, even if you feel \nlike you have given up.  He will provide peace and comfort, even in the \nhardest and ugliest and most hopeless circumstances.  It doesn't come all \nat once, but it does come.   ",
