            "text": "Gender Assigned\nGender is determined immediately upon fertilization. The 23rd pair of \nchromosomes establishes the sex of the baby. The mother's egg contains an X \nchromosome, while the father's sperm carries either another X or a Y \nchromosome. An XX combination means your baby is female and an XY \ncombination means your baby is male. This means that the baby's gender is \ndetermined before it is even considered a fetus.\nDevelopment\nThough during the first few weeks of fetal development your baby's internal \nand external genital structures are the same, the organs will eventually \nchange. Your baby's gonads will either become ovaries or testicles. The \nphallus will become either a clitoris or a penis, and the genital folds \nwill become either labia or scrotum. This all depends whether or not \ntestosterone is present. Testosterone will be present in embryos with a Y \nchromosome, and male sex organs will begin to form. If testosterone is not \npresent, female organs will develop, making female the \"default sex\" for \nhuman beings.",
