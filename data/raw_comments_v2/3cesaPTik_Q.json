This reaction provides \nthe energy needed for chemosynthesis. For this reason, tube worms are \npartially dependent on sunlight as an energy source, since they use free \noxygen, which has been liberated by photosynthesis in water layers far \nabove, to obtain nutrients. In this way tubeworms are similar to many forms \nof life which live in the ocean below depths that sunlight can penetrate. \nHowever, tubeworms are unique in being able to use bacteria to indirectly \nobtain all materials they need for growth from molecules dissolved in \nwater.

            "text": "I actually did a project on this recently for a college biology course. I \nestimated the cross-sectional area of Godzilla's femur, and concluded that \nin order to function effectively as a skeleton for an animal that large, \nthe bone would have to be able to withstand pressures in excess of 400 \ngigapascals. If Godzilla's bones were made of tungsten they could actually \nsupport his weight and the stresses of movement without much issue, but \ntungsten isn't exactly a common element, and getting enough of it to make a \nskeleton out of would be practically impossible. But luckily, there are \nother options.\n\nAs Godzilla grows in size, the pressure inside his bones would at some \npoint, long before maximum size is reached, reach the levels necessary to \nsynthesize diamonds. If the bones have a source of free carbon, and some \nway of producing large amounts of heat for short periods of time, like \nmicroscopic air bubbles, which would give off heat when compressed by the \npressure from the animal's movement, then diamonds would begin to form \nwithin the bones, providing the ultimate structural reinforcement at the \npoints where it's needed the most, without jeopardizing the bone's natural \nbone-like qualities.\n\nI'm not saying that this is in any way likely to happen (there have been \nmillions of species of animal that have lived on earth and none of them had \ndiamonds in their bones), but if it somehow were to happen, then an animal \nthe size of Godzilla could easily become mechanically plausible. In fact, I \ncalculated that a truly specialized species with this kind of reinforcement \ncould, under 1G of gravity, reach a height of nearly 3,000,000 kilometers, \nabout twice the diameter of the sun, before its bones would start to \ncollapse under its weight, which, at that size, would be the least of its \nworries. Before it got to that point, the pressure inside its body would \nhave caused the atoms within it to undergo sustained nuclear fusion, \ncausing it to explode from the inside out and collapse, turning it into the \nbloodiest star in the universe.\n\nThat would happen BEFORE its skeleton was ever in danger of collapsing \nunder the animal's weight. So as unlikely as this scenario is, it's not \nCOMPLETELY impossible.\ufeff",

However, it \ndoesn't account for the possibility that life - somewhere out there in the \nuniverse - might - just might - exist in a way we are not familiar with. We \ntend to model life - and all its possibilities - on what we see around us \non Earth. But there's no reason to suppose that life - down to the cellular \nlevel  and even down to having very different kinds of blueprints than the \nDNA we are used to - might be fundamentally different in construction \nelsewhere. \n\nSo I think the better response to the question \"Could Godzilla exist\" \n(which carries with it the assumption and the implied question - could he \nexist as a life form as WE know life) would actually be \"What KIND of \nmakeup would Godzilla need to have in order to exist? How would he have to \ndiffer from all life as we understand it?\"\n\nSuppose he has a cell structure similar to graphene, which is a honeycomb \nmatrix of carbon atoms arranged on the atomic scale in such a way that it \nprovides even a very thin sheet of the material with IMMENSE strength. As \nin, you could put a few tons concentrated onto a single point of it and it \nwouldn't break even if the sheet of it were paper thin. So now imagine \nGodzilla's skin and other parts composed of such an arrangement of carbon \natoms. We're carbon-based lifeforms to begin with. \nNow if you extend that to his skeletal structure, you have an ULTRA-strong \nsupport structure capable of even supporting thousands of tons, especially \nthe bones consist of something akin to a honeycomb, cross-braced structure \nmade from things similar to carbon nanotubes.\n\nAs for how much he'd have to eat, this also assumes a metabolism and \nphysiology like our own and not an entirely unknown type of organism. \n\nGodzilla is fictional. So it stands to reason he may be composed of \nas-of-yet fictional materials that function in fictional ways.

This is why elephant bones are so much thicker than a human bone \nscaled up to the same size. The problem with Godzilla is that even if it \nallometrically scaled up its legs to hold up its immense weight, the \nthickness of the bone and muscle would be so large that there would be no \nspace between each leg. It would basically be one large leg. So if Godzilla \nwas a stationary animal it would be possible to get to 90,000 tonnes, but \nif it is going to move it needs to do some physical shenanigans to get \naround the scaling problem (for example having muscles that have a stronger \nphysiological cross sectional area and having super-dense bones that can \ntake the pull and stress of large muscle and immense weight).",

The explanation of the logic used is \nalso clear and concise. I really enjoy learning in this particular way. One \nparticular concept that caught my eye was the Square-Cube Law. This law \ndoes make sense to me, as it is logical that as the size of an object \nincreases, its volume increases at a faster rate. When this law is applied \nto bones, the volume in comparison to the surface area determines the \nstrength of bones. After doing some calculations, I realized that if the \nshape is changed (example: rectangular prism) that the bones get weaker and \nweaker at an even faster rate. When you mentioned that if the force of \ngravity was reduced or Godzilla was a water creature that one could \nsurvive, I wondered: how much would the force of gravity have to be \ndecreased?
