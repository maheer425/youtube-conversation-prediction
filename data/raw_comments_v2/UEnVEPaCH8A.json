And even then, Woody admitted that this plan would cause them \nto break some rules, so in other words there is in fact a good reason \nbehind why they never come alive in front of humans. The Lotso thing on the \nother hand I can fully understand. I mean, the whole reason for him being \nevil is nothing more than a misunderstanding! If someone could've stood up \nto him and explained what really happened back then, maybe he would learn \nthe error of his ways and have a change of heart, instead of continually be \nblinded by envy and leave Woody and co to die at the junk yard when he had \njust one chance to make himself become a hero for a change!
