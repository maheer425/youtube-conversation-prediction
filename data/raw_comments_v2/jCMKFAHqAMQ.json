As you strike the top of the bottle, a low \npressure area is formed at the bottom of the bottle forming small void \nbubbles. As the high pressure forces down on the region, the bubbles \ncollapse...well explode rather causing an immense amount of force on \nwhatever surface it's touching. This also can happen in pipes an boat \npropellers. The mantis shrimp even uses this to get at it's prey!\ufeff",

Well, if you want to do that, simply tap \nthe glass with a spoon or your fingernail. The note it makes is the note \nyou need to sing to break it. Bear in mind this is the easiest method but \nnot the only one. If you create a resonant (full sounding) bass or baritone \nsound of the note you heard while tapping the glass, it will break, but \nthis is far harder to pull off.\ufeff",
