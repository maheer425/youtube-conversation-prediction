I found a whole new world to enjoy being part \nof and I cannot imagine life without dextromethorphan which is the active \ndrug in cough remedies.  It is a slightly dissociative psychedelic \nanesthetic.  If mixed with marijuana as I used to do, it produces the \ngreatest creative, and also genius ideas, state of mind!  The two go \ntogether like butter on toast.  Like milk with chocolate.  I am telling \nthis to everyone because it is time for a new generation of people who are \ngoing to change this world for the better and enjoy life more than they do. \n I look and see a world full of people who are off and have not been turned \non yet.  I want to open your minds like in the movie the Matrix.  I learned \nchess really fast and enjoyed learning more than others have.  I guarantee \nyou that much.  It makes learning sickly fun like you cannot believe. \n Spread this everywhere and do it because it is the new world order here. \n Not to hurt the planet but to help it become something really good.  If \nyou all disagree then do me the favor and give me back my tree of life \nbecause I live a life without life.  My life is very dull and empty and as \nI told others in my own family, I am glad I used the drugs I used in my \npast all the way down to nicotine and benadryl.  But I want my life to have \nmarijuana in it if it is safe to inhale it vaporized.  I hope sincerely \nthat my lung and a two thirds can handle it and I won't have those feelings \nof shortness of breath when it becomes legal.  You guys shouldn't be \nputting people in prisons and jails for getting high!  That is a sin.  But \nback to the rest of what I was saying is that pot made it fun as hell and I \ncreated the greatest pieces of art, paintings, pencil, etc. and music while \nintoxicated on marijuana.  It DOES make people more creative and also makes \nthem more likely to have the will to do these artistic things.  All of you \nout there who have it made and are growing dope and and or know people who \ndo and you have it are afraid to let everyone know about it because of the \nlaws and I don't blame you but somehow we have to change this place because \nit is sinful for people like me to Not have it anymore.  It is MY life and \nnot for others to tell me that I CANT have that plant.  It is a SIN. \n Especially if it turns out to be pieces of the tree of life!  Like it says \nin the revelation in the new earth, which isn't part of this one because \nthis one is going to hell infinitely small and hot, the tree of life is \ngiven freely for the healing of nations.  Some people might think this \nearth should be the new earth and the tree given freely?  And the goal of \nall people should be to feel good and the only downside being addiction? \n If it grows freely then everyone should be happy.  All the plants in the \nearth with psychedelic properties are good if you learn to use them to open \nyour mind and learn about yourself and your existence and stuff.  I even \ngrow morning glories for their use.  It is stupid period to place people in \njail for using any of these things and we can change this if we just all \ncome together and change the earth.  Why doesn't everyone want to make the \nplanet a better place?  Well I already know why and I told you if you go to \nmy web page Jacob Baugh Louisville, Ky.  Satan doesn't want us to have \nheaven.  Satan wants misery and war.  So we should want this place to be \nlike heaven!  What is in heaven that is written is the tree of life!  So \nwhy not make this place heaven?  Throw the devil off the planet.  If you \nwonder why god would even have the devil here is because this first heaven \nand earth is going to vanish infinite heat and pain and all the evil stuff \nwas here for that purpose so it goes bye bye forever.  There is a new \nplace.  What makes a person what he or she is and knows they exist right \nnow.  IS it even deeper than atoms and there arrangement?~  By my music and \nstuff at iTunes ;)\ufeff",

On the kids, I agree that they should not smoke weed, but what's wrong \nwith ID requirements to get it, just like alcohol. Then driving while high, \nuh first off when you get high everything seems to be a little slower, so \nyou would be a little more cautious and drive slow, right? Personally if I \nfeel too high I'd rather not drive in the first place but if you compare it \nto alcohol, it's a completely different affect. Driving drunk and I've done \nthis, I drive fast, wreckless and in denial that i'm drunk without thinking \nabout others safety or my own. Which is wrong, and that's why I really \ndon't like alcohol I would rather smoke me a joint instead and relax and \nchill. Now dogs.... I don't even know what's up with this excuse, I have a \ndog and I keep my weed in a drawer where she cannot get it, plain and \nsimple. Conclusion: The DEA is full of dumb excuses and they know it( when \nit comes to marijuana ). Legalize it and you will see improvements around \nour country, guaranteed.      \ufeff",
