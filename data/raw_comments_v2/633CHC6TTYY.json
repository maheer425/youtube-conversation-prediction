            "text": "Here's a champion idea that I've created. Hope you like it! :D\n\nPharos, The Projection of Light [6300 IP]\n\nType: Mage (Summoner)\n\nDifficulty: 9/10\n\nAbilities: \n\nPassive (Mirror Image): When Pharos casts a damaging spell on an enemy \nhero, it will receive a stack of Imagery. When it has 4 stacks, a mirror \nimage of the hero will be created for 8/10/12/14 s which can be controlled \nby Pharos. The image has the same stats, items and abilities (except the \npassive and the ultimate skill) as the original hero. More than one hero \ncan be marked with Imagery stacks, which lasts forever or until Pharos or \nthe hero dies. (no CD, no MP, no range)\n\nActive 1 (Illusionary Wall): Pharos shoots a beam of light towards a \ndirection, exploding when it hits the terrain, and enemy entity, an enemy \nunit or a dark area. When it does so, the unit closest to the explosion \nwill be dealt with 78/116/154/192 (+75% AP) magical damage. Furthermore, it \nwill form an imaginary wall that is 4/4/5/5 m long at its explosion \nlocation for 3.5/4/4.5/5 s, blocking any ranged attacks but also letting \nanyone go through it. Any attacks by an enemy hero that is blocked by the \nwall reduces its duration by 1/1/0.5/0.5 s (2/2/1/1 s for tower shots). \n(12/9/6/3 s, 71/90/109/128 MP, 6/7/8/9 m)\n\nActive 2 (Teleportation): Pharos blinks to a target location. For 3/3/4/4 \ns, there will be a mark on the ground where Pharos was before she \nteleported. She can then reactivate this skill to teleport back to the mark \nbefore it vanishes. The CD of this skill will start immediately after it \nhas been casted. (16/14/12/10 s, 67/83/99/115 MP, 5/6/7/8 m)\n\nActive 3 (Phase Field): Pharos blurs an area for a brief moment, buffing \nallied heroes and debuffing enemy heroes for 3/4/5/6 s. Enemy units in the \narea receive 79/113/147/181 (+45% AP) pure damage while only enemy heroes \nare slowed by 20/30/40/50 %. Allies heroes (including Pharos) will receive \n6/12/18/24 % more armour and magic resist while only Pharos will gain the \nability to dodge melee attacks. (19/17/15/13 s, 77/96/115/134 MP, 3/3/4/4 m)\n\nUltimate (Wall of Pain): This skill can only be casted when 2 or more walls \nare active. Pharos connects the walls together to form a gigantic one, \ncrushing those who stand between them. Enemy minions are instantly killed \nwhile enemy heroes take 212/255/298/341 (+60% AP) magical damage and are \nsilenced for 2.5/3/3.5/4 s. The newly-formed wall lasts as long as 2/2/3/3 \nx the remaining duration of the walls add together. It also increases \nallied ranged attacks by 50/100/150/200 % and reflects any enemy ranged \nattacks back. This skill can be reactivated to push the wall to a desired \nlocation, instantly killing any minions while dealing 156/195/234/273 (+30% \nAP) physical damage to enemy heroes. However, the wall will get weaker \ndepending on how many enemy heroes it has hit. 2-3 enemy heroes: the wall \nno longer reflect (just block) enemy ranged attacks and also no longer \nincrease allied ranged attacks\u2019 damage. 4-5 enemy heroes: the wall breaks \naltogether. Every enemy ranged attacked reduces the wall\u2019s duration by \n1/1/0.5/0.5 s while allied one increases it by 0.5/0.5/1/1 s. \n(118/106/94/82 s, 175/203/231/259 MP, 16/19/22/25 (max range) m)\ufeff",
