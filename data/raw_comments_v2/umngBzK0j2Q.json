Past pets taught me that when you regulate their meals they \njust get into starve-n-stuff mode. They'll gorge on the food then lay \naround for hours. They just learn that food is scarce (only shows up at \nspecific times in specific quantities) so stuff up while you can. Grazing \nteaches them that food scarcity is not a problem, so they nibble and burn \noff what they eat as they go instead of turning into a fat storing gorge.\n\nHowever, our cat was definitely a pain to get to sleep the first couple of \nmonths. Ironically, it was mostly the dog that taught him to sleep on a \nschedule. Kitty loves playing with the dog, but the dog needs to sleep at \nnight and take some naps. He got snippy with kitty a couple of times when \ntrying to sleep for the cat to realize not to bother him when he's sleepy. \nThen kitty learned to just nap at the same time. So, they both sleep though \nthe night, are up at morning to play and eat, take a midmorning nap \ntogether in the sun, play in the afternoon, evening nap, more play then \nbed. Maybe we got lucky.\ufeff",

Then it's time for \"sleep.\" As in I lay awake for \nhalf an hour listening to her try to meow and jump her way into my bedroom \n(and with sticky tape on the handle)! I would let her in to sleep with me, \nbut I have allergies that only show up severely when I'm around cats in a \nclose proximity for more than like 8 hours (don't ask, discovered it when \nat a sleepover at a friend's house. Her 6 cats have the run of the place). \nEventually she'll quiet and go to sleep, but at around 3 to 5 AM she'll \nstart again and won't stop until morning. Every. Single. Day. It's gotten \nto the point where I've actually accidentally trained myself to sleep \nthrough her meows, but my mom can't, and it's driving her insane, \nespecially the fact that she has to ignore her. \ufeff",

He wants me to stay \nawake and watch him sleep... maybe to keep a look out for predators... or \nmaybe just to pet his belly while he sleeps?

If I got up, he'd usually not try to to hold me \ndown, sometimes he would but he'd follow me around until I laid down again \nthen would climb on my belly again. This lasted for the first 2 years. O.O\n\n The last few months though, he's been sleeping elsewhere for long periods \nof times. He'll come and stand on my chest and stick his nose in my face if \nI fall asleep. Just stand there, staring. In the dark. I'd try to ignore \nhim or wrap my arm around him and roll over or something.... he would \ncontinue to just stay and stare. Or occasionally try to smother me with his \nneck whilst laying his chin on my head. I have narcolepsy, so automatic \nfunctions can be triggered in my sleep. He figured that one out, and now \nI'll wake up and realize I'm cradling a giant cat like a baby and rubbing \nhis belly in my sleep. Hard to ignore him when he's learned how to \nmanipulate my sleep disorder. \n\nHe's actually not my cat, technically. I'm not allowed to have pets. He's \nkind of a stray that adopted me. During the day, he's out running around \nplaying outside in the little wooded area on the property. At night, I \nsneak him in and snuggle the hell out of him. I make sure he's fed, \nwatered, vet bills taken care of. Would totally adopt him and have him as \nin indoor cat if I could. Anyway, everyone in the apartments look out for \nhim, so I'm not too worried. I generally sleep during the day anyway, \nbecause of my sleep disorder... but now it's become almost a necessity, \nbecause if I fall asleep at night, he'll either manipulate my sleep \ndisorder or he'll try to smother me under his fur or he'll smack me in the \nface or stand on my chest, staring creepily. If I'm awake, he'll happily \nlay on my belly and fall asleep and stay asleep all night if I were to not \nmove. If I fall asleep though... it's game on. \ufeff",

If he is a little bit less active but otherwise healthy, \nit's ok. Once they are 6 or 7 they will want to sleep most of the time \nanyway. If however your cat loses all interest, stops grooming himself, and \nbecomes apathetic, of course there is something wrong and you need to take \nhim to the vet. If not, don't panic, try new toys, and try to adjust to the \nschedule of when he's in play mood and when he isn't.\nOne question: Is he a house cat or free range? Because free range cats have \nseasonal activity - in spring they jump to action, and in winter they \nalmost hibernate. House cats have the seasonal thing a little less \npronounced. But my cats, after spending 3 months behind my wood stove \nsleeping, just brought me 3 birds home in 2 weeks. It's spring.",

            "text": "Jackson, I am completely on board with your suggestions on how to \"train\" \nmy cat(s) to let me sleep and I'm happy to tell you that I am on board with \nall of your suggestions regarding getting the cats circadian rhythm set, \nbut my situation is a bit unique.  I have 2 cats, a 6 yr old female that \nhave been getting a small amount of wet food at breakfast time and then \nthey are free-fed Purina Cat Chow for the remainder of the day.  The female \nhasn't been overeating and when she was the only cat in the house, a small \nbowl of dry food would last her 2 days.  Now that the male cat is sharing \nthe same food, I'm having to fill a much larger bowl with the dry food \nevery day and sometimes twice a day so that the male gets enough to satisfy \nhis appetite AND leaves enough for the female too.  The biggest reasons why \nI have always fed these cats and others I had in the past dry food was \nbecause it was what most everybody fed cats AND because it was more \naffordable than wet.  I'm a little concerned that I may not be able to \nafford to feed my cats if I switch to wet food only.    First because I \ndon't know how much is suggested by the manufacturer for each cat.  I know \nthat they consider things like the age,weight and gender of the cats you're \ntrying to feed, but the bottom line is the wet food doesn't go nearly as \nfar and it costs quite a bit more than dry food. Plus aren't cats supposed \nto have some dry food in their diet?  I've been told that they need it to \nhelp clean their teeth sort of like milk bones for dogs.  Can anyone help \nshed some light on this issue for me?  I want to get started feeding my \ncats the right way so that they will stop being so needy and keeping me \nawake at night and/or waking me way too early in the morning.  Oh, and one \nmore question too........how am I supposed to just ignore my cats if they \nchoose to bother me at night when I'm trying to sleep?  My cats don't just \nsimply meow and run around my bedroom making noise.  They like to crawl all \nover me and one does this thing where its like she's giving me a massage. \n I lovingly refer to it as she's \"making biscuits\"!  Like a kitten would do \nwhen still trying to get milk from the mother cat.  Sounds like it would \nfeel kind of good, but at 3 or 4 am, trust me, its a pain in the butt and \nit wakes you up just the same.  The male cat rummages around in my bedroom \nand crawls under the bed and attempts to get under the covers, attacking \nanything he thinks he saw move and climbs up on my computer tower desk and \ntall dresser where all my expensive electronics are and tries to catch the \nfish in a small fish tank that I have on the top of my desk too.  I'm \nafraid that if I don't do something to deter him from doing these things, \nhe might just end up breaking something or splashing enough water out of \nthe fish tank and all over my desk and computer.  Worse yet what if he \nmanaged to tip over the fish tank or my computer monitor or tv (it's just a \nsmall 19\" flat screen)?  He's a very rambunctious 13 lb 9 month old who has \nno fear and to him this nightly haunting is just a game.  I know I have to \nstart somewhere, but I fear that to simply ignore him when he's hell bent \non getting fed on his terms could be extremely costly and even dangerous or \nhazardous to his health.  Not to mention, what it could do to my mental \nwell being or job security if he did manage to ruin my computer desk or \nworse my work computer and the data files it contains!  So sorry to all of \nyou who have to read this rambling of mine.  I'm aware that this is much \nmore than a \"comment\".  It's just I need to solve this issue before I go \nnuts and I had more questions than I could find the answers for in going \nthru all of the many video responses here in the pages of great info on \nthis site!  Any advice that anyone can offer would be truly appreciated. \ufeff",
