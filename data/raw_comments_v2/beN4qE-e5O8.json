You also ignore \nthe fact that the Natives did not only live in Georgia either, they were in \nfive other states within the area, so why would they not threaten it too? \nYou put too much emphasis on secession, when in fact the states would not \nhave threatened secession over local issues that they have dealt with for \ndecades prior. That would be like saying Maine would secede if the Canadian \nborder debate was never solved, when in fact it was simply a localized \nissue. The times that secession was advocated were during times when areas \nand/or people felt heavily oppressed, such as the Federalists in \nMassachusetts or the Confederates who felt unrepresented in government due \nto Lincoln being elected, which was easily the straw that broke the camel's \nback (among other issues). This is a first and here I thought my AP US \nHistory class reviewed the Jacksonian Era. And I cannot imagine Jackson \nsaying that, the guy fought in battles to destroy Native American territory \nand take their lands. Remember the Seminole War, for example, where he \nchose to justify invading Florida through attacking Native American groups \nand proceeded to capture two Spanish forts? And yes, adding land was a \nbonus, it was sorta the entire reason for moving entire populations out of \nland that they inhabited.\n\nYou seem to be trying to pretend that Jackson had some totally justifiable \nreason for ignoring a Supreme Court hearing and removing Natives from their \nlands, despite the fact that Jackson had been doing that sort of stuff \nsince the War of 1812.",

Very few provisions were made for the trip, it actually was a \ndeath march. Jackson had a real hate on for native people and never denied \nit.\n\nImagine this happening to you and your family. Suddenly it would have real \nmeaning.\n\nI also had white relatives who were part of the round up who were guards on \nthe trip and became \"Indian Police\" in Oklahoma when it was the Indian \nTerritories, one of the most corrupt law groups to ever exist.\n\nI have some familiarity with both white and native relatives and ancestors \nof that period.\n\nI know more about them than I do a black ancestor on my mother's side. She \nprobably belonged to a great great uncle who owned a number of slaves.\n\nGene mixing is a big factor in the USA, and especially in the southern \nstates that had a large population of slaves, then ex-slaves.\n\nmany American racial purists should get a dna test, the results could be \nvery surprising.",

For if Jackson had denied the \nextension, it would hurt his presidential campaign, therefore forcing \nJackson (as Biddle thought) to Reinstate the 2nd National Bank for another \nterm. But Jackson vetoed it, and told the American people that this was to \ncreate less of a gap between economic classes (Which pissed a lot of \nwealthy people off (A big reason that the Whig party was formed)).\n Also, Jackson never ran for president in 1836, that is an error. Jackson \nwas initially elected in 1828, and reelected in 1832.
