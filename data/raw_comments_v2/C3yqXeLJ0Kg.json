While Kevin Breel is not saying anything \nrevolutionary, he's taking a different approach from some others before him \nwho emphasize solely the importance of removing ignorance. While that's \nimportant, he also says the challenge should be removing intolerance and \naccepting adversity. The first step? Speaking and knowing you're not being \njudged.\ufeff",
