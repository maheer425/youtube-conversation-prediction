No \nprecedence prior to that - and it solved lots of things in life. \n\nArtists are more abstract thinkers - Even algorithms can be very \nnon-repetitive and grow and self embellish. Human imagination and thought \nknows not limit so why just art. You might say that all Mathematics is also \nno original - work done by Gauss is not at all original. Pyramids are not \nan original idea I suppose, mankind always had them :)\n\nAcid house and Jungle did not have a precedence.\n\ninfinity is a concept that is very original and very ancient. Zero is a \nconcept that is also very original. \n\nIf the wheel was not original I suppose creativity is just an excuse for \nnot having original in the first place. \n\nWisdom of God is not redundant, it is a gift to us if we make use of it. \n\nArtists who study art can understand the underlying patterns in all \ncreativity and that involves study and then discovery and creation and then \nexploration. \n\n\nIn Exploration - If Vespucci had discovered America then I suppose other \nexplorer are also very unoriginal - both as an idea and as a contribution - \nthen I suppose other explorers would never venture out as they would feel \nun-original. Such exploration has made us discover the world - sure there \nare trees and air everywhere - in every diverse culture and country - every \nlanguage - every religion - I suppose nothing is original then eh??\n\nContributions are the main goal to me -- if things are original and not \nindividual then art for me would cease. There is lot of original shit as \nwell I suppose - this one is just regurgitation. \ufeff",
