This car looks absolutely gorgeous. Where Ferrari, \nMclaren, and Porsche and forgotten to give the driver MORE in their \ninteriors. Mr. Pagani realized that the interior is the other half of the \nequation. That leather looks and feels absolutely amazing. The naked carbon \nfiber lets you know its all about speed. The brushed aluminum shows insane \nattention to detail and an mad obsession. Then there's the driving \ncharacteristics and design. Driving this car like Chris did makes you a man \nlol. You can see his eyes buck out. He is on his absolute full awareness \nmode. Its not a car you can fool around in without being hyper aware of \nwhat's going on with the suspension. Once you turn everything off, you get \nto feel the roller coaster ride that is the Huarya. And the looks are just \nwhat makes this car so grand. Where as Lamborghini and Ferrari have gotten \nstuck in a endless design cycle, Pagani has its own road to carve. With no \nparent corporation telling him how and what his creation should do. Whether \nhis company sinks or swims is entirely on how good his products are and the \nbuyers desires. And i can honestly say i dont see how ANYONE could NOT want \na hypercar like this. Its special, because its not just another hypercar. \nIts THE hypercar that definitely will age well.\ufeff",
