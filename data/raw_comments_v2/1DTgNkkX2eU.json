At the time, Steve was \"The Captain\" (Red, white, and black \ncostume) and not Captain America. Thor was unsure who to trust between \nSteve and Iron Man. There had been some turmoil in the Avengers previously, \nand Steve didn't seem like the person he remembered.\n\nThor lost the hammer during a battle and Steve grabbed it while he was \nbeing piled on by enemies. He suddenly sent all of his attackers flying, \nand found himself in possession of Mjolnir. He remarked at how much power \nhe could feel, and didn't feel comfortable with it. He threw Mjolnir back \nto Thor when he located him.\n\nAfter the battle and seeing that Steve was worthy of wielding Mjolnir, Thor \nrealized Steve was still the man he knew, that Tony's trustworthiness was \nquestionable, and that he would never question Steve's loyalty and trust \nagain.\n\nNow Marvel may have retconned a thing or two in the comics, so that may not \nbe how things currently stand in the comics now.",
