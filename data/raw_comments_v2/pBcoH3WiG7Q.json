Even though that may sound like a \npositive it can be a negative people you have to keep your body cooled down \nmanually so you don't face heat exhaustion and stuff. While blacks tend to \nhave larger sweat glands and contain more sweat glands than other races. \nI'm not sure if all this is 100% true, but I'm sure it changes with your \ngenetics and varies from person to person. xD",
