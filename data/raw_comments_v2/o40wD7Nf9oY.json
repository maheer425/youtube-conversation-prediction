            "text": "+blazer7811 Well I think when he said stickiness in 1:45 he made a mistake!\nspiders don't stick they use thousands of tiny hairs that makes the \nfraction between the spider leg and the surface so Great that the spider \ncan carry 170x his wight.\nAnd the answer for your question: how does he remove his legs?\nthe Hairs on each of the spider legs have a unique direction from the other \nlegs making it \"sticky\" if it moves to the opposite direction of the hairs.\nFor example: image a spider standing on your desk and magnify his legs you \nwill see that the back legs have ALL the hairs pointed to the back like \nthis   \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ and the legs get more or less \"sticky\" depend on the \ndirection they move.\n                                                   ----------> more \"sticky\"\n                                                   <------- less \"sticky\"\n \nTry it yourself!! get on the floor (best to be with mat on) and half close \nyour fists Or make your fingers like clews, now place both hands on the mat \nand push to the back with your hands only, you will notice a great fraction \nbetween your fingers and the mat, now simply slide your hands Forward this \ntime....... Yes your hands simply slide on the mat!!!! and this is how \nspider legs are \"sticky\" if he move the leg to one direction and not \n\"sticky\" if he move it to the other direction. \n\nSo if the spider have EIGHT legs with each leg heirs pointing to a \ndirection, If the spider push all his legs to the opposite direction he \nwill simply get \"sticky\" and that is how they can hang upside down!\n\nI hope I answered your question :D \n  ",

My \nquestion was not \"how does the spider stick to the wall?\" instead my \nquestion is \"how does the spider *remove* its self from the wall since the \nwall is so \"sticky\" and the spider's strength is much weaker than the \nwall's \"stickiness?\" \n\n:At :55 in the video, he says that spider's can lift up to 50x their own \nweight.\nAt 1:45, he says the \"stickiness\" to the wall can carry 170x the spider's \nweight.\n170>50 therefore, in theory, the spider should not be able to remove \nhimself from the wall once attached.",
