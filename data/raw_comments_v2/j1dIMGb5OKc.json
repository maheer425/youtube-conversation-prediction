            "text": "On June 5, 1933, the United States went off the gold standard, a monetary \nsystem in which currency is backed by gold, when Congress enacted a joint \nresolution nullifying the right of creditors to demand payment in gold. The \nUnited States had been on a gold standard since 1879, except for an embargo \non gold exports during World War I, but bank failures during the Great \nDepression of the 1930s frightened the public into hoarding gold, making \nthe policy untenable.\n\nSoon after taking office in March 1933, Roosevelt declared a nationwide \nbank moratorium in order to prevent a run on the banks by consumers lacking \nconfidence in the economy. He also forbade banks to pay out gold or to \nexport it. According to Keynesian economic theory, one of the best ways to \nfight off an economic downturn is to inflate the money supply. And \nincreasing the amount of gold held by the Federal Reserve would in turn \nincrease its power to inflate the money supply. Facing similar pressures, \nBritain had dropped the gold standard in 1931, and Roosevelt had taken note.\n\nOn April 5, 1933, Roosevelt ordered all gold coins and gold certificates in \ndenominations of more than $100 turned in for other money. It required all \npersons to deliver all gold coin, gold bullion and gold certificates owned \nby them to the Federal Reserve by May 1 for the set price of $20.67 per \nounce. By May 10, the government had taken in $300 million of gold coin and \n$470 million of gold certificates. Two months later, a joint resolution of \nCongress abrogated the gold clauses in many public and private obligations \nthat required the debtor to repay the creditor in gold dollars of the same \nweight and fineness as those borrowed. In 1934, the government price of \ngold was increased to $35 per ounce, effectively increasing the gold on the \nFederal Reserve's balance sheets by 69 percent. This increase in assets \nallowed the Federal Reserve to further inflate the money supply.",
