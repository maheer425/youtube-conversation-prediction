You can assume whatever you want how he got back into Gotham \nbut it s never explained in the film. They could have written in an \nexplanation and that would have fixed the problem but hey completely gloss \nover how he got in. They would never send EVERY SINGLE cop down in the \nsewer. They would only send in 1 or 2 swat teams. Their is no point in \nsending in an army of thousand of cops. Again, they just did that to be \nconvenient for the script. Symbolic gesture? You're looking too much into \nit. It was just to show he was alive. There was no symbolism. Even with \nauto pilot, a nuclear blast cover a radius of many miles with seconds.

There's no way \nBatman would've survived in avoiding a nuclear bomb if he had 5 seconds on \nit before exploding. The grave, statue of Batman and potential funeral \nseemed realistic enough, too, and Blake/Robin inherited Bruce's Bat Cave. \nI'd like to think that he did actually die, although Nolan leaves it open \nfor debate and it opens a new Batman for what we're going to see in Batman \nVs Superman: Dawn Of Justice next year.\ufeff",
