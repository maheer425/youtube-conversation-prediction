What's really notable is that when one type of \nbamboo dies, all the bamboo of that kind in the world dies. All at the same \ntime. So if there's only one species of bamboo around, pandas are at risk \nof starvation once the flowering cycle hits.\n\nThe bottom line is that pandas are one of the most specialized species in \nthe animal kingdom, and specialist species have a lot of trouble adapting \nto changes in their environment and competing with more generalist species, \nboth of which are ultimately necessary to avoid extinction. It's quite \npossible that pandas would be an endangered species today even without \ndeforestation, simply because of their quirks. But I bet we'll figure out a \nway to keep them around, purely because they're so darned cute.\ufeff",
