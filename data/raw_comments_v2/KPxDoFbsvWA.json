The plot \nis set during the Cold War, when there were heavy military and political \ntensions between the U.S. and Russia but no full declaration of war was \never made. \n\nThe events of the movie itself are fictional, but the reason that \nintimidation and fear tactics - such as missile locks and Maverick's stunt \nhere - is because both sides were working on a RoE that specified that they \nweren't to fire unless fired upon. The entirety of the Cold War was like \nthis - a lot of threats with very little actual combat.\n\nThe final dogfight has Russian MiGs engaging U.S. aircraft first because, \nas the CAG reports, a disabled U.S. ship drifted into Russian territory and \nthe MiGs were sent to intercept it on the assumption that it was a warship \nexhibiting hostile intent and breaking the ceasefire. \ufeff",
