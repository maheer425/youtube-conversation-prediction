And because of that you felt \nthey were mocking you, or looking down on you. While what they were \nactually doing, was reveal their personal insecurities, by their need to \nshow off in front of you. Similarly those who branded them hipsters \noriginally, and everyone who has continued the tradition since, expose \ntheir personal insecurities, by doing so.\n\nPeople who truely feel confident in who they are, neither feel threatened \nnor inferior in the company of people who either believes themselves to be \nbetter than them, or demonstratively display an affluent lifestyle, or in \nother ways tries to convey superiority, like intellectual capacity, \nphysical strength, beauty/sex appeal, a talent for humour etc etc.\n\nIt also works the other way around. Truely confident people don`t have a \nneed to feel superior to others, no matter how successful, rich, smart or \nwhatever is so great about them, they are. And they are more likely to want \nto talk to you about your interests and life, than brag about their Phillip \nPatek watch, sports and luxery cars, exclusive hollidays or whatever it \nmight be, should you find yourself talking to one someday.\n\nPeople who truely are confident in who they are, usually are a joy to meet, \ncause their interst in others is to get to know them, have interesting and \nfun conversations - not to use as an audience for lectures of their success \nin life. Those who have a need for that, and there are quite a few of those \namong the super successful ones as well, do it out of a need to compensate \nsome form of personal inferiority. Their experience of feeling confident \nand well - is dependent of someone else to feel inferior to them, belittled \nor insiginficant.
