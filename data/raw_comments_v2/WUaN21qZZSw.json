Im a HUGE gearhead. i love everything \nwith an engine. i agree with you 100% about lifes too short to only be a \n(insert car company here) guy. When i go to shows or see a unique car in a \nparking lot i have respect the guy who drives it because i know at the end \nof the day, he put his hard earned time, money, and effort into getting it \nto what it is today.
