I only \nhave a smaller parrot (a Pionus, like a conure) and he is smart enough to \ncatch on to whenever he'd poo on my bed or pillow etc, I'd immediately pick \nnim up and whisk him to his cage, thereby putting together cause and \neffect. So now he makes very distinct sounds, insistently, to tell me he \nhas to poo and sure enough, every time I take him to the cage to do it, he \npoops RIGHT away. They communicate intelligently, it's not always random \nnoises they make - you just have to pay attention to them (in this case, I \nrefer to the sounds he makes as the same ones he does when he purposefully \nwants to be obnoxious - which he doesn't do often). I praise him everytime \nwith BIG excitement when he then poops after being placed on the cage. Sure \nit takes some time (and some messes), as they need to fail before they pick \nup on what you want; patience is key. But it's better than freaking 'em out \nwith a trash can or paper towel!\ufeff",
