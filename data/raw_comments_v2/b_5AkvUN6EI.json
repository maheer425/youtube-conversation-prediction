When Brian does wake up the ring is obviously \nthe first thing he notices and goes to Hwanhee's house assuming it was \nHwanhee who took her from him and puts the ring back on her. Hwanhee (from \nhis reaction) wasn't expecting Brian to wake up and to an extent actually \nwished he hadn't as Brian would take her back (you can see this from his \nexpressions). When they do confront each other Brian passes it off as \n\"having taking care of his girl\" but shows clear disdain for Hwanhee as he \nsays \"things will now return to the way that they were\" knowing full well \nthat Hwanhee loves her and well as you all see she begins regaining her \nmemory remembering it was Hwanhee who caused the accident and lashes out at \nhim for \"loving her\" while she was in that state. The showdown happens and \nin the end when Hwanhee gets hit by the car they both realize it was him \nwho paid for the surgery and ultimately him who saved and allowed Brian to \nreturn (as it was Hwanhee who gave up one of his kidneys so Brian could \nlive even if there was a probability of Brian not making it through the \ntransplant) thats my take on it.\ufeff",
