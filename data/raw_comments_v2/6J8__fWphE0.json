I'm merely being nostalgic and longing for a time when life \nseemed uncomplicated.  I think that's why most of us came to watch this \nclip.  The intent of my comment was not to make a political statement but \nto point out the irony of watching it in 2015.",

You're one of those, am I right?\n\nLast year a 6 year old elementary school boy almost had assault charges \nbrought against him by a local school board for kissing a girl in school \n(Anyone remember this?  Hunter Yelton in Colorado Springs.) and your \ninterpretation of school today is that it is too permissive.  Well, that is \nbecause you are either a NUT or you are too IGNORANT and STUPID to make \nsimple observations from current events.  I'm a whole lot older than you \nand can testify that public schools were far more lax 30 and 40 years ago \nthan they are now.   You could skip class, even a day of school without \nserious problems.  You could touch other students, get into fights, etc., \nwithout fear of suspension or expulsion.  If you misbehaved you were told \nto leave the classroom, or were sent to the principal, and there was also \ndetention.   Zero tolerance and that other crap means public schools are \nrun like day prisons.  Not figuratively.  They have many similarities to \nhow prisons and mental institutions are run.\n\nToo bad there are so many people like you who cannot seem to think straight \nenough to notice what has been going over the past few decades.",
