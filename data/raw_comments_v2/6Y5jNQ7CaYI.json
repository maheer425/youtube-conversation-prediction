(This statement \ncomes from personal experience, i own both an iMac and a custom built \ntower.)\n\n\nAnd to crush your ''a hacker can use whatever computer they like, it \ndoesn't matter'' fantasy: No, if you want to commit to any form of hacking \nyou will need to have a decent stable OS, and a significantly higher amount \nof RAM because you will need to run a lot of programs, scripts, CMD \nwindows, etc. at the same time. (This depends on what you are doing, of \ncourse.) So you will need a significant amount of RAM in your device to \nkeep your device from getting slow and deepfrying your own PC's circuits, \nwhich is fatal to your computer, FYI. \n\n\nSo you will need to have more RAM than any Mac has built in, and since \nApple does not allow any form of tinkering on your iMac/Mac device, it \nwould be a retarded idea and plain suicide for your Mac to `hack` something \nwith an Apple device, because you will most likely fry it's circuits.
