This was not a kind hearted \nriver folk that was corrupted it was a greedy, evil filled creature that \nthe ring easily took over after he had it. So the only one responsible for \nSmeagles actions and fate was smeagle. \n\nMost any sacred site is jealously defended and Smeagle was fishing in a \npool the Rangers thought of as sacred. They had every right to kill him but \ndid not. Yes they beat him but again he was fishing in a sacred pool not \nsome random stream. They could have killed him but did not. \n\nAs gail stated Faramir even forfeited his life to let them go. And it was \nrather obvious smeagle was not free or even close to free of the ring. He \nis like any addict that has a moment of clarity then as soon as things get \nhard again he is right back after the ring and scheming to kill Frodo and \nSam. This after Sam explained to him that \"Master\" was just trying to save \nSmeagle.\n\nFor Smeagle to break free of the ring there would have to be some good in \nhim and there never was. He got himself into this with greed and lived that \nsame way with the ring. One moment of clarity does not redeem you for a \nlife time and then some of green and hate.\n\nBlame who you want for Golems down fall and death in the end but had he not \nkilled his friend for a ring he barely saw he would not have been in this \nmess. And before you start in on how the ring corrupted him making him kill \nhis friend, if his had that much influence on him that kind of proves he \nwas full of greed and hate to start with.\n\nThere is an entire chapter of the book they skipped for the move where they \nstop by someones house on the way to the Inn of the Prancing Pony. They \nshowed him the ring, he picked it up and held it then gave it back with no \nill effects. This was to prove that the ring only corrupted those with dark \ndesires. This is why both Frodo and Bilbo were able to be in contact with \nit if with few ill effects for a long time yet Smeagle succumed to it \nwithout even touching it (if you want to go with the argument that it did \ninfact make him kill his friend).\n\nSo who is to blame for Smeagle and his fate? No one but Smeagle. Feel free \nto blame who you want but we all know now who is really to blame. But feel \nfree to be like him and blame other for your own faults. ",

Like I said, I have proof that his voice is real whereas \nyou have none that it is fake. As for the animation, I clearly said that \nthere was animation done. But it is motion-capture animation. That type of \nanimation is based off of a real, live performance, not like cartoons are. \nCompletely animated cartoon characters are based off of drawings. All of \nGollum's movements and his animation is based off of a real person, and a \nlive action performance. Sure, there is a conceptual drawing for what \nGollum looks like. But in motion-capture, the animators take the original \ndrawing, and apply it to the live performance of Andy Serkis. That's just \nthe technique applied in motion-capture. And if you don't even know that, \nthen you don't know much about movies in general. Because practically every \nmovie with a CGI character started using motion-capture animation once Lord \nof the Rings had so much success with Gollum.\n\nAnd if you're gonna bring up that thing about Gollum's eyes, then yes, they \nare big. But obviously, you haven't read the books, because his eyes and \nhis weird, distorted body are what make up Gollum's original character. \nYes, I know it's unrealistic. But that's the way Tolkien describes him. And \nif I seem like a Lord of the Rings/Peter Jackson fanatic to you, then so be \nit (btw, I acknowledge that King Kong isn't such a great movie). It's \nbetter than being an ignorant douchebag who pretends to know how everything \nworks without even going behind the scenes of the movie they are ranting \nabout. \nFurthermore, I acknowledge that this \"fantasy stuff\" is what I'm into. But \nI also like movies that are set in the real world. I also like movies that \nare truly the big budget ones, that are 500 million-dollar projects. As \nlong as they are good movies. And if you're really gonna go into this whole \n\"this movies sucks because it used millions of dollars on advertising and \nselling\" argument, then you are basically hating on every single film of \nthe modern world. If that's the case, then simply don't watch movies. Tis \nas simple as that.\n\nDo you honestly expect for a movie to NOT use a lot of money on \nadvertising? What's the point of making a film if you don't try to get \npeople to watch it? And for a story like Lord of the Rings, which by the \nway already had a HUMONGOUS fanbase because of the books, how could they \nNOT try to sell out the theater when so many people already love the story? \nHow could they NOT spend a lot of money to try and make the movie good when \nso many people have such high expectations?\nEither way, that doesn't change the fact that Lord of the Rings still used \na lesser budget than any other movie during that time period, both in the \nmaking and in the advertising. So you're argument is negated anyways.\n\nYour argument is based around the fact that you don't like this \n\"unrealistic, fantasy\" stuff. If that's true, why even go through the \nbother of watching it then? ",

That was \nall the actor, Andy Serkis. How do I know that? I just watched the special \nfeatures behind the scenes. I saw with my own two eyes and heard with my \nown two ears, Andy Serkis record this scene. It sounded exactly as it does \nnow, no voice distortion required. And by the way, this animation is not \ncartoon, stupid. This was MOTION-CAPTURE. Do you even understand what that \nis? In essence, the animated characters are actually physically and \nliterally acted out by real actors. The animators use the actor's body \nmotions during a scene as a base to animate. And for your information, Lord \nof the Rings was one of the first to use motion-capture.\nAnd don't act as if you're any more mature than a 15 year old, when you \nstart ranting on a film you know absolutely nothing about. What millionaire \nmade this?! Peter Jackson at the time he made these movies was not a very \nwell known director. He had little to no money or credit among other \ndirectors. He had to convince New Line (which was considered an inferior \nstudio at the time), to endorse these movies based on the stories' own \nmerit. \n\nIn fact, you seem to know so little about Lord of the Rings, that you don't \neven know that it was all shot in New Zealand. Nobody thought that \nsomething like Lord of the Rings could be shot anywhere but Hollywood. And \nif this really WAS an ego project for a multi-millionaire studio and \ndirector, they would have definitely done it in Hollywood. But no, instead \nPeter Jackson chose to do it in New Zealand, a country who almost nobody \npaid attention to in terms of film-making. And he used a large cast of \nno-name actors, actors whom nobody had really heard of in Hollywood.\n\nLastly, Lord of the Rings used a lesser budget than almost any other movie \nmade (in Hollywood) that year, so the success these films have had has \nnothing to do with money. Before you start trying to make yourself feel \nlike a smart-ass, why don't you try doing your research first? You don't \nknow the efforts and work people put into Lord of the Rings. Hell, you \nhaven't even tried to learn about it. So what makes you think you could be \na good judge of anything this movie has done or accomplished?",
