You know the one \nwhen the girl inherited her grandmother's enormous house and her deranged \nmassacring cousin in the process.\n\nSeriously all of those people could have been spared if the dumb broad \nwould have just read that freaking letter!  And button up your damn shirt! \nDon't just keep it closed with one! Who runs like that?  And don't pick up \nweird hitchhikers! And don't leave said hitchhikers alone in your new house \nwith an unknown number of vastly expensive treasures. And don't freaking \ncheat with your best friend's boyfriend on a vacation to her house! And \ndon't explore a house with a cannibalistic, chainsaw killer inside it \nwithout more police backup!\n\nI feel sorry for absolutely no one who died in that movie. Hell, I was \ncheering the killer, saying things like,\"Her next! HER NEXT! I want no \nsurvivors!\" \n\nHonestly, that whole movie was just a maelstrom of stupidity! This is why \nslasher movies are no longer scary. Because everyone's too busy being \nstupid and taking their clothes off rather than using their brains.\ufeff",
