There's thousands of \nkilowatts in an EV battery, and if you were to want to charge it within \nminutes, you would have force more power through the charging device than \nwould be safe. Generally speaking, the charging wires are simply not big \nenough to transfer that kind of power. They would explode if you tried. \nCurrently, the size of cable you would need to charge an EV within minutes \nwould be too heavy to even lift, and not only that, but you'd have to have \nthat cable attached directly to your nearest power plant.

They usually have a set gear ratio because they can only \nspin so fast, but that's what sets the top speed of the car. The charge \nlength depends on the current battery technology, and will improve over \ntime (with newer models once the technology is available). Different cars \ntake different amounts of time to charge depending on how much power they \nstore and what battery technology they use. You can charge a Tesla half \nfull during the amount of time it takes you to eat lunch. Unlike a regular \ncar which you fill up when empty, you charge your car when at home just \nlike you would your iPhone. You would only need to worry about charge time \nwhile on a road trip, but as long as you take pit stops for meals or \nbathroom breaks you will be fine. Tesla is also working on a way to swap \nout your low battery pack for a fully charged one in less time than it \nwould take to fill a tank of gas. I am no expert on this subject, but \nhopefully this answers your question.",

It's basically the same thing as \nstepping on the gas pedal to accelerate vs. stepping on the gas pedal even \nmore to spin the tires, except it does this backwards, and the reverse \ntorque applied against the forward rotation induces an electric current \nthat feeds back into the battery, which is what regenerative braking is.\n\nThe clever thing about this kind of electric torque vectoring is that \ninstead of putting that regenerative braking current into the battery, if \nit's wired and programmed right, it can actually just send that current \nstraight over to the other wheels which will add extra power without having \nto take it out of the battery.",

On top of that, I don't think you realize how much has \nto change when car manufacturers make these electric variants of their \nvehicles, it really has to start from the bare chassis, who wants to do \nthat for a \"conversion\"...\n\nThe battery industry just \"merely\" needs a breakthrough with range and \ncharging speed.  Obviously that is a lot easier said than done, but I'm \nsure some brilliant mind will discover something.  In the meantime we have \nhydrogen fuel cell cars coming too, so things will be very exciting for the \n2nd half of the 2010s.\n\n+Alexander Young the smartphone analogy wasn't that good...  Electric cars \naren't held back because people don't believe in them, they are only held \nback because of the current technology.  Smartphones were able to \nrelatively quickly dominate because the technology was already present to \ndevelop phones with advanced computing power, the only thing missing were \nthe consumers to buy them to allow cellphone manufacturers to invest more \nmoney into lowering the prices so that everyone else could afford them.  As \nI pointed out, the range and charging speed are just really difficult \nbarriers to overcome right now.  Even if everyone in the upper-class bought \nand invested in an electric car right now, it still wouldn't change the \nindustry.  Electric cars need 3 or 4 times the range they currently offer \nand charging times have to be almost as quick as filling up a gas tank or \nelse people will continue to view gas powered cars as much more convenient.",

Personally i could still go with a home phone and leave the cell \nphone to road side emergencies. And I know a lot of people like this. It's \na luxury rather than a necessity. It is also built around marketing \ngimmicks. It was born by the gimmick and will die if it doesn't have a new \ngimmick. \nBut let's talk about cars. People expect a certain something in their cars, \nwhether that be reliability, economy, luxury, or performance. There are \nusually two ends to the spectrum with a lot of balances in between. Each \ncar tries to have a little or a lot of what people want from the list \nabove, and it's broken down into sectors of price. It always comes back to \nwhat people can afford. Usually these products always start out as \nexclusive luxuries that only a hand full of people can buy. It creates a \nmarket that eventually expands enough and trickles down to the rest of the \npeople. Initial money made gets spent making things better. Longer battery \nlife, more places to fill up those batteries and quicker fill times. And \nthe price goes down. \nThe thought of being completely free of gasoline is definitely a \nrevolution. And not only that, but even the average person can for the \nfirst time, see the wheels of business motion taking shape and perhaps they \ntoo can get in on the early stages of the market. \nI don't discard companies like Nokia, or say they are \"left behind\", as if \nevery company always makes the best or right decision all the time. They \ncould be working on something even bigger and make a come back too. \nMcDonalds is the largest fast food chain in the world, but that doesn't \nmean they're the best, or that they'll be around forever. Same with \nWal-Mart. \nIf you ask me, I'd rather have something that just works for the next ten \nyears without any hassle. Make something so good that people don't want to \ntrade it in a week later for the next new thing. Make something memorable. \nSomething that matters. To me that's real progress. And good business.

Alternatively, a combustible engine can even be made to run on \nalcohol... I'd rather prohibition come around again and that booze be used \nfor proper driving...Does anyone realise the damage done to the environment \nin the push for electrical cars?\n\nBatteries shelf life are less than a tenth of an engine. Lots of money is \nrecirculated to greedy businesses already who provide terrible quality \nbatteries, it is a 'renewable' that is in fact not so renewable.\n\nBatteries are plastic, how many millions of tonnes of plastic have been \ndumped in the ocean already? Plastics leak BPA into the water supply, BPA \nis a precursor to excessive estrogen production, causing sexual \norientation/gender assignment complications. Never wonder why there is such \na large and growing LGBT culture these days? Not that I have a problem with \nthat, I just feel sorry for the complications, social integration issues \nand abuse that most LGBT people face. This is seriously down to birth \ncontrol pills poisoning the well so to speak, synthetic HGH/Testosteron \nusage increase and BPA products being dumped in the ocean, not just that \nsociety is becoming more relaxed. A total cacophony of unnatural \nintervention in the unfolding of life. How many species of ocean life are \nfading away? Overfishing indeed being a contributor but undeniably so is \nBPA/plastic. Hydrocarbons are the least natural substance on Earth and \ninexplicably damaging to life.\n\nPlastics are non biodegradeable, once made they are here to stay, they can \nbe recycled, but we already see how it is much easier to simply dump them \nin the ocean/landfills. This not only causes above issues for humans but \nalso every organism on Earth, we could even go so far as considering the \natomic implications in a space that would once have been free for \nnature/physics/chemistry to take it's course, a gap to fill so to speak is \nnow filled with a permanent thing that can not be turned to anything else \nbut a hydrocarbon.\n\nBatteries are heavy, resulting in overall higher total energy expenditure, \nenergy which could be used for homes.\n\nBatteries require a high alkaline/acid, another substance highly damaging \nto life... You can start blabbing on about burning petrol... I clearly \nstated we can make cars run on oxygen or alcohol with 0 emmissions quite \neasily.\n\nEngines are metal, recyclable, more robust, lighter, more efficient, (dont \nargue that the electric motor has zero energy wastage, that may be true but \nbatteries as a power source are very wasteful and inefficient... Not to \nmention where the electricity comes from in the first place... Power \nstations? Another inefficient waste of energy in adopting an extra process \nthat really is not required, we can run cars on oxygen) \n\nSo I really do feel a little wrong taking sides on this one but you \ngreenpeace hippy types are actually really really wrong on this one and \narguing simply for the purpose of fitting in to a social stereotype. And \nbefore I get attacked by the supposed 'lovers and saviours of the world'... \nI have previously been a representative for the socialist party, I am very \nvery passionate about making choices and changes for the greatest good, \nfeel strongly about equal rights and equality in all forms and really do \nlove each and everyone I meet, whatever their position/disposition. I do \nnot wish to argue, hate or be hated, merely provide the best, most logical \nsolutions.\n\nI could write a book about this, yet it would be pointless... Most people \nare more bothered about being right that thinking hard enough to do what is \nright, and most 'clevel people' are only clever in theory/only paper/in \nwords. In actuality many of them lack the broader spectrum required to \nthink of a truly impeccable solution, largely resorting to quoting stuff \nalready heard to sound clever than being truly revolutionary and creative. \nFuck you all :)\ufeff",

Just making \nhydrogen and using it in a car is at least two times dirtier (depending on \ntechnology), because it takes at least two times the amount of electricity \nto get hydrogen to the user than to use that electricity to charge your car.\n\n2. When talking about emisions everybody compares the tail-pipe eision of \nan ICE car to emmisions of a coal power plant, nobody takes in acount the \nemisions that are generated before you even burn  the gasoline in a car. \nAnd the world average amont of electricity  that comes from coal is about \n50%.\n\nI actually did the calculations on CO2 emmisions, and came to the conlution \nthat the electric car emits more CO2 than gasoline if more than 77% of the \nenergy that goes into charging the car comes from the least efficient coal \nplant.\nIn addition to that, refining oil uses electricity (not longer oil it self, \nbecause it is cheaper), and for geting 1 liter of gasoline out of oil you \nneed to put in the amont of electrical energy that could propel electric \ncar the same distance than 0,5l of that gasoline.\n\nSo if you switch to electric and you charge your car 100% from coal plants \nyou still produce 60% less CO2 than gasoline car (all together not just \ntail-pipe).\n\nFurthare more the \"dirtines\" of a car is not mesaured in just CO2 but allso \nin NOx and SOx, which couse acid rain and contribute to resperatory \ndeseases.\nLarge power-plants have allot of filters that prevent those emitions going \ninto the air, in contrast to ICE cars that only have a catalitic converter, \nwhich is not as afficient as those filters, and is completley useles on the \nfirst 5min of driving, because they have not yet wormed up to their \noperating temperature.",
