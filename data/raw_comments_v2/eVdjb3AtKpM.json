Then thats when San E starts to go to the psychiatrist and has \nall those flashbacks as he tells her. He realizes she has the same bracelet \nhis ex-gf had and starts to wonder why they both have it. The psychiatrist \nrealizes that San E is talking about the person whom she's dating and thats \nwhy she gets all uncomfortable and stuff lol\ufeff",
