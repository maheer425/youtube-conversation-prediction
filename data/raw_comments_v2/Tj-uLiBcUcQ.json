(I'm not sure how they \nmet, I think the adoption company held a meeting or something, I'm not \nsure). They didn't know the other twin was going to show up, because they \ndidn't know the other existed. Anyway, the twins showed up... *wearing \nexactly the same outfit*, a red check dress, exactly the same. (again, \nkeeping in mind these two families didn't know about them being twins). The \nfamilies noticed the similarities between the two girls, and asked the \nadoption company if they were twins. They denied. They had a DNA test to \nprove that they were twins, and they were. They both switched contacts.\nBoth twins have grown up in two different countries, speaking different \nlanguages. They do not speak the other ones language. They visit each other \nregularly, on Christmas and things.  Just thought this was amazing and \nkinda wanted to share it :p\ufeff",
