            "text": "*The Power of Connection*\nHedy is an amazing speaker, and as much as this isn't about tango, it is. I \nespecially like the story about the tailor. I think, in tango we see our \nsuits more easily. We at least see the variety. It is not always easy to \nsee our own suit. Everything in our life shapes our being, from how we were \ntreated as kids to the chair we sit in at work, even how we feel about our \nwork. Especially how we feel about ourselves. Our being is imprinted, but \nthen we wear it on our physical body like a suit. We hunch, and scrunch and \nbind, we shuffle, bounce, lope and strut. It reminds me of a beginner in \ntango, I told him to try to stand up straighter. He said, I am, you should \nhave seen me before tango.\nTango is frequently about getting a new suit as much as it is about \nlearning to dance.\ufeff",
