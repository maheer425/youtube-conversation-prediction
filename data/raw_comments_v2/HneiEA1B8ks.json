An \nobservable resistance to flow that causes gravitational lensing. Dark \nenergy causes space-time expansion and moves through space time like a \ncold, quantum fluid. This tidal force, like a current of water, affects the \nmovement of objects with mass. The greater the mass an object possesses, \nthe greater the resistance to flow.  Spiral galaxies are where dark matter \nis observed through gravitational lensing. The spiral arms do not fly apart \ndue to this resistance where they stay intact like hurricanes or leaves \nfloating in a liquid whirlpool. Scientists estimate that dark energy \naccounts for approximately 68 percent of what exists (matter and energy) in \nthe known universe. Could such a large percentage of energy be a sort of a \nuniversal engine of the cosmos, affecting everything in its path; and \ncreating motion, gravitational lensing, and dark matter? Dark matter \naccounts for approximately 27 of the mass-energy of the universe. Is it \npossible to have two unknown forces accounting for such a large percentage \nnot be two tied to each other through some cause and effect relationship? \nPerhaps force is a better description since we don't know dark matter as \nactual matter but can only observe its effects.

You have to look \nat the context of that story, if you are curious, you can check here \nhttp://christianthinktank.com/qmeanelisha.html. God punished not only them, \nbut their parents, who diverted from God and turned to worshipping many \nidols. They did not raise their children God-fearing and respectful to his \nprophets, and to other people. God cut their lives short also to avoid \ngreater evilness they would do if they grew up. However, that story \nhappened if the Old Testament, when people were different and other \nmeasures might not have worked, so such bitter lessons were taught. We live \nin the New Testament time, when the whole relationship between humans and \nGod is different. God does not need to appear like a punisher and have \npeople follow him out fear, like it was in the Old Testament, when people \nwere more primitive, but revealed his love to the world, and wants us to \nfollow him out of love.\n\nGod is never angry, God is  love, and everything he does is out of love. He \ndoes not want us to suffer forever in hell, that is why he uses different \nmeasures to turn us on a righteous way in our short lives, that will lead \nus to Heavenly Kingdom and eternal bliss after death. What kind of loving \nmother will feed her kid with sweets and chocolates to keep a child happy \nfor a while, if she knows it will lead to child's sickness and suffering in \nthe future? However, God cannot force anyone into Heaven. If a person does \nnot want, even God cannot save him.\n\nWith all that said, God's ways are miraculous and often are hidden from our \nunderstanding, because we do not see a greater scheme of things. We all \nhave God's voice within us, though, which is our conscience, and behave \naccording to how our conscience tells us to. We all look for beauty, \nkindness, love, fairness, forgiveness. Let's hope that everybody hears that \nvoice, and then our world will become a much better place to live, without \nwars, terrorists and immoralities.  ",
