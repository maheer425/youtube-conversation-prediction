However, it \nis a shame that all his efforts, in the end, will not improve the overall \nsituation of the people in Ethiopia or the world as a whole. Please do not \nget me wrong. Reducing child mortality is AWESOME, and the concept of \ntrying to eradicate an entire disease is magnificent. It will go a long way \nto reducing suffering and improving the lives of many.\n\nHowever, Ethiopia's population has increased fivefold in the last fifty \nyears. Where in 1950 the population was a mere 18 million, now it is 87 \nmillion. Projections show that at the current rate, it will host several \nhundred million people within 50 years. This is an economic and \nhumanitarian disaster. You can throw all the development aid, medicine, \neducation and volunteer organizations in the world at this country, but it, \nand countries like it, will continue to be a horrorshow of suffering and \ninsufficience. In fact many of these strategies, such as food aid, will \nonly worsen the situation. It's a horrible thing to say, but as long as \nthese people don't get their demographics under control, any of our efforts \nin helping them will inevitably be futile.\n\nYou can't just continue having 5 children per mother when you couldn't even \nfeed, house and educate 2 of them. It's simple logic. It is unfair and \nunrealistic to expect the developed world to take on such a responsibility. \nAt some point, personal responsibility has to be taken. In western \ncountries, \"native\" populations have largely stabilized, in many cases even \nstarted to shrink. This is a good thing - fewer people means better living \nconditions and less pressure on the ecology of this planet. However, \nconstant migrant streams from poorer countries mean that our overall \npopulation is still increasing.\n\nWe don't need another three billion people on this planet. Regardless of \nwhere they're from.\ufeff",
