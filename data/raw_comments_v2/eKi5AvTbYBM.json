The name SAS is a historical one, as they parachuted \ntraditionally as their initial preferred method of entry in N Africa, then \nMalaya etc..to Pink Panther Landrovers proving a safer alternative as well \nas Yomping. The SAS do train with the SEALS as do, arguably the more elite \nSBS... and for the record, the SAS do have a water based unit... The SBS, \n then SAS, wrote the modern special forces rule book... applied with huge \nsuccesses in Africa, Northern France, Malaya, Borneo, Oman, Rhodesia, \nSierra Leone; Gulf, Eastern Europe Afghan Ireland .......Successfully on \nall counts!\n\nThe SEALS and Green Beret (Green Beret being the first) were based on an \nAmerican model conceived by his attachment to the SAS in Malaya, and he \nthen set up the Green Beret... Unfortunately, The American did not follow \nthe SAS rule book completely, and the training ethos suffered somewhat. \nProbably a cultural difference as a reason for that. Not to mention, \nfighting in Borneo, was a far harsher environment than Vietnam, where the \nbrits and Anzac SP's operated successfully including along side the Koreans \nin South Nam, with very little loss of life or difficulties...\n\nAs for the water based work, the SBS are UK's specialist amphibious unit, \nexisting (even if by a different name at the time) before the SAS in the \nSecond World War (cockleshell heroes). This was one of reasons why the UK \nsuffered less casualties than the Americans during D Day.  The SBS \nspecialised in beach rec cons before sending regular soldiers to \nunchartered territory to be butchered....\n\nPaddy Ashdown pioneered many of the submarine entry diving techniques as \nwell as mastering the protection of oil rigs in the North Sea... A very \nharsh and dangerous logistically issue in itself! While the SAS and Boat \nService have now joined in training selection, Maggie was always very fond \nof the Boat Service and left many more clandestine missions to them... She \npreferred the 'Not by Strength, but By Guile' approach to business, even \nthough she was very fond of the more published SAS. Considering the Boat \nService come from the toughest and longest standard entry unit in Nato \n(Royal Marines), to then, if successful, be selected for the gruelling \nMountain Troop, then higher to the SBS! This means the bench mark is \nalready higher than the SAS who traditionally, unlike the Marines, \nrecruited from the Guards and Paras, RAF regiment and Marines who failed \nSBS selection!...\n\nLastly, you can not ever forget the importance of experience...especially \naccompanied with a record of successes that have far outweighed the \nfailures... Even Storman Norman wound his cynical neck in, when he then \nrealised the value of the SAS /BS; eyes on the ground skill and MI6 \nsurveillance methods.\n\nRant over ;-)\ufeff",

Sir \nPeter DeBilliere ( UK's most decorated soldier) established the world's \nfirst anti terrorist/close quarter specialist unit in the SAS and have \ntaught nations willing to listen.. (The SAS/BS have often been privately \ninvolved in other famous Foreign siege's without taking the credit) \n\n\nThose taught have included the Americans, Germans, Anzacs and many more \nnations... And unlike the others, it's members have to have been in the \nArmy/Marines etc for at least 3 years, plus experience SAS operators too... \nThis standard also applies to the perhaps the most elite unit of them all, \nthe SBS. They have taught the world how to rescue hostages from boats and \nand climb oil rigs located in the treacherous and cold North Sea, without \nthe aid of boats.. just Subs! Delta force does not require experienced \nsoldiers to become members. They set up their unit, based on our model. \nHere endeth the very brief lesson.. :-)",

Why did that guy (the one who \nwas shot) and was seen looking like a dummy on a stretcher, get the right \nsteaming hump when one of the patsies scrawled a bit of graffiti on the \nwall?  Was it his house?  No, but he was there as a hostage held against \nhis will for 5 days without complaining.  However, the mainstream media \nwould have me to believe that a simple bit of graffiti got his wild up and \nhe demanded to be shot because he was so angry about a bit of graffiti but \nhad no problem being held captive!?!?  I've got a sas book called ''This is \nthe sas'' by Tony Geraghty.  It says about the siege ''It was May 1980 \nbefore the SAS was called upon to perform publicly the techniques it had \nrehearsed in secret for seven years\"  Sounds like to me it was all a false \nflag event.  The unsuspecting actors playing the bad guys were murderd by \nthe sas, except for one who was rescued by the other highly paid crisis \nactor hostges who thought it was going too far killing the fake baddies. \n He got a 25 year jail term, even though no other convict had ever seen him \nin any jail?  Robin Horsfall who took part said 25 years was too long. \n Interesting thing to say Robin?  Perhaps he knew it was all a hoax.  The \ndeath and subsequent humiliation of John McAleese doesn't sit well with me \neither.

Now army can attempt the SBS selection, without being in the Royal \nMarines for 3 years first (The SBS originally being only open to Marines, \nset a higher starting bench mark then any regular entry unit in the world, \nas the RM's have the longest training regime in NATO ... Now both units \nshare the same selection process, then go off and do there special \nduties..This was due to government cuts.. They operate as part of joint \nteam, with 2 other sections - Special Reconnaissance Regiment (SRR), and \nSpecial Forces Support Group (SFSG)., the SAS being the other part.  \n\n\nSecondly, the 22 SAS Sabre specialise and focus in specific aspects of war, \nunlike 21 and 23 SAS who have other functions...\n\n\n22 nd SAS specialities \n1.

The name SAS is a historical one, as they parachuted \ntraditionally as their initial preferred method of entry in N Africa, then \nMalaya etc..to Pink Panther Landrovers proving a safer alternative as well \nas Yomping. The SAS do train with the SEALS as do, arguably the more elite \nSBS... and for the record, the SAS do have a water based unit... The SBS, \n then SAS, wrote the modern special forces rule book... applied with huge \nsuccesses in Africa, Northern France, Malaya, Borneo, Oman, Rhodesia, \nSierra Leone; Gulf, Eastern Europe Afghan Ireland .......Successfully on \nall counts!\n\nThe SEALS and Green Beret (Green Beret being the first) were based on an \nAmerican model conceived by his attachment to the SAS in Malaya, and he \nthen set up the Green Beret... Unfortunately, The American did not follow \nthe SAS rule book completely, and the training ethos suffered somewhat. \nProbably a cultural difference as a reason for that. Not to mention, \nfighting in Borneo, was a far harsher environment than Vietnam, where the \nbrits and Anzac SP's operated successfully including along side the Koreans \nin South Nam, with very little loss of life or difficulties...\n\nAs for the water based work, the SBS are UK's specialist amphibious unit, \nexisting (even if by a different name at the time) before the SAS in the \nSecond World War (cockleshell heroes). This was one of reasons why the UK \nsuffered less casualties than the Americans during D Day.  The SBS \nspecialised in beach rec cons before sending regular soldiers to \nunchartered territory to be butchered....\n\nPaddy Ashdown pioneered many of the submarine entry diving techniques as \nwell as mastering the protection of oil rigs in the North Sea... A very \nharsh and dangerous logistically issue in itself! While the SAS and Boat \nService have now joined in training selection, Maggie was always very fond \nof the Boat Service and left many more clandestine missions to them... She \npreferred the 'Not by Strength, but By Guile' approach to business, even \nthough she was very fond of the more published SAS. Considering the Boat \nService come from the toughest and longest standard entry unit in Nato \n(Royal Marines), to then, if successful, be selected for the gruelling \nMountain Troop, then higher to the SBS! This means the bench mark is \nalready higher than the SAS who traditionally, unlike the Marines, \nrecruited from the Guards and Paras, RAF regiment and Marines who failed \nSBS selection!...\n\nLastly, you can not ever forget the importance of experience...especially \naccompanied with a record of successes that have far outweighed the \nfailures... Even Storman Norman wound his cynical neck in, when he then \nrealised the value of the SAS /BS; eyes on the ground skill and MI6 \nsurveillance methods.",
