Simon's seizure \ndisorder wasn't even foreshadowed until the title \"character\" shows up for \none chapter and is never seen again. There was precisely one reason for \ntheir deaths, and that was to drop Anvils of Symbolism on the reader. There \nwas no subtlety, no finesse about it. There's no *depth* to having your \nstory swerve with screeching tires to grab that Senseless Death Out of \nNowhere Just Because pickup it needs to get on the required reading list.\n\nSimon and Piggy's deaths didn't impart any deep message to me. Simon's \ndeath was just a checkbox. He was the most sympathetic and interesting \ncharacter in a book that I was being forced to read for class, and since \nthere was no dog in this book, he was going to be sacrificed on the altar \nof cheap shock value by the end of it. Piggy's death -- while having a \n*slightly* better set-up -- doubled down on that with added grossout, but \nthe most important thing was that it evoked from me the Eight Deadly Words: \n\"I don't care what happens to these people.\"\n\nOh, and then Ralph gets saved by Deus ex Machina on literally the *very \nlast page,* because the author had written himself into a corner and \ncouldn't bear to follow through and kill the main character when all \ncircumstances pointing to that ending.\n\nLord of the Flies is a heavy-handed pile of symbolism and bad writing \ntechniques. It also makes the implicit assumption that the behavior and \nattitudes of a bunch of boys from a British boarding school are \nrepresentative of all humanity. Its point is about as valid as the Stanford \nPrison Experiment (i.e., NOT).\ufeff",

Fuck your foresighted optimism.\"  \"Your food is \nfine Jack.  It's just fine.  You gonna make us starve?  Or you gonna wait \nfor hunting orders?\"  I mean fascism is a military word for exploitation, \nbut it's also nature's way.  People are above it, but only by as much as \ntheir plan b can allow them to be.  Does Jack recognize any plan b that he \nis giggling to himself is too gay, or is he too exhausted from hunting and \nfeeling self-evident in his pandering to the other hungry children?\n\nI just wonder if there isn't a better thing to call somebody who doesn't \nknow he's being fascist than fascist.  Is a fascist someone who's selective \nin his teaching method (like Scientology luring people in for years before \nspringing their secrets) or is it somebody that shoots before asking \nquestions (puh-lice)?  Economics and politics are both inherently fascist? \n Then so would people be.  Jack is just a bold little kid with a bunch of \ndesperate little kids.  You can draw comparisons of adults to children but \nnot children to adults.  It's a warning of what we're going to become, and \na call to recognize that we have no idea what we are.\n\nThere is no all important blame game worth playing because we all just rely \non ourselves to give ourselves the answers we're looking for.  If we found \na culprit, it would be blame wrongly assessed (as if on a decapitated, \nrotting carcass).  We never needed a conch; that is just a magic feather. \n If we are less contrived by our superstitions, we can prevent killing \nourselves off one by one to be saved by some distant future usses that will \nstill be embroiled in some bullshit war stemming from some cause we risk \ngetting hung up on.  I would want to say that's economics, but more \nimportant than what to blame would be to treasure the hand reaching out to \nus in any circumstance.

We don\u2019t even know he was \nlooking for an enemy. He\u2019s by himself on the beach, and the first words out \nof his mouth are \u201chullo\u201d. Hardly what you would say to your enemy as you \nstorm his first lines of defense, right? But you\u2019re correct, there is a \nmuch more devastating, \u201ccivilized\u201d, atomic war going on when the officer \nchides the boys for acting like savages.\n \nThat said, I love your reviews, keep \u2019em coming! 5 minutes is really short, \nbut maybe you could have pointed out that Jack and Ralph are archetypes of \nCain and Abel. Jack only becomes violent and savage as a way of reclaiming \nthe leadership which he felt Ralph \u201cstole\u201d from him during an impromptu \nelection at the beginning of the book. The pig\u2019s sacrifice can be seen as \nrepresenting the blood sacrifice which led Cain to become the first \nmurderer (in the Bible at least). You could almost say that Jack bears the \nphysical \u201cmark of Cain\u201d on him (he is described as \u201cugly\u201d), but that would \nbe pushing it a bit far.\ufeff",

If this individual \n(Sparky Sweets Phd.) is comfortable portraying stereotypes regarding his \nown race, you should be comfortable about laughing about it too. It's \nentertaining and educational in more ways then one. Yes, you learn the \nshort version of some literary text but Sparky also gives you many things \nmost people miss. He always finds symbolism, and connections in these books \nmost people look over. It also is a good reminder that people are not \nalways what they seem and to never underestimate anyone. If anything not \njudging people based on appearance is a life lesson that will help young \nstudents in the future more then most things they learn in school.",
