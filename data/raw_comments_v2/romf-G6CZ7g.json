Your preference is totally \nfine, but your suspension and stickier tires don't make the driving \nexperience any better, it just makes the handling better which, again, was \nnot what I was getting at. I personally only drive on paved roads, so AWD \nONLY becomes useful during snowfall. and unless you're gunning it or in \nmuddy terrain... AWD/RWD on gravel/dirt (rural?) isn't gonna be that big of \na difference. and as for comfort? the FRS for that short amount of time, \nwas way more composed, less bouncy dampens the road imperfections better \nthan my STi which is still on its stock suspension. and yes, I do drive \nlike a grandpa, I seriously do. I've also mentioned a few times that my \ncomparison is NOT fair, was just comparing it to my PERSONAL vehicle's \n\"driving feel\", not its driving dynamics which = handling of the cars.",

Granted I've only ever driven cars more expensive with more power\" \nguess like the Si :] regardless, so I thought speed was the first big gripe \nyou had with the car.  Changing out the clutch, fine, all preference of \ncourse, personally would upgrade the suspension or get stickier tires over \nthe clutch.  Also you said \"but I haven't driven each cars to its limit \nwhere AWD would be a positive experience and RWD would be a negative\" so I \nwas replying terms of DD, I've driven several of my friends' STIs here in \nArizona where AWD does help a lot in the more rural areas but the \nexperience for the FRS/BRZ with its neutral RWD is very enjoyable, unless \nyou drive like a grandma :p either way, all the cars you have mentioned, \nSi/GTI/STI are just more \"comfortable\" as a DD mostly because they are much \nmore sedan-like with their high driving positions.  The fair DD experience \ncomparison would be to look at S2000s, Miatas, RX8s and even the current \nmuscle cars, they share much more similar driving dynamics.",

I'd \nchange the clutch for starters to hopefully get a heavier feel to it, and \nadjust the clutch peddle so it doesn't engage so damn high. again, I didn't \ncomplain about the lack of power, It'd be nice though, like the Si/GTi with \na higher low end torque. Not the low torque at almost redline BS. why do \nyou keep referring to \"losing traction\" or \"AWD\" like I ever mentioned \nabout RWD sucks?

The BRZ/FRS is never going to ever be a real speed demon \nexactly like the Miata or even to a lesser extent S2000/RX8, all very poor \ncars to pick if you are looking for a HP machine, but the cornering speeds \nalone with the BRZ/FRS make the GTi and Si feel and look like boats.  You \ncan drift even going only 20 MPH, lol.

IF you want \nto go out to the track to have a laugh and just enjoy driving the car on \nthe limit, the 86 is by far the best.  May I suggest that you go for the \n16x6.5 wheels with 205/55/R16 eco tyres and you'd be pretty much on the \nlimit lap after lap.  The bigger tyres you put on, the more boring the car \nbecomes.  I best thing about the 86 is the chassis balance. I used to think \nthat drifting a car on 4 wheels has no point, but when you can do it lap \nafter lap, you actually understand why the 86 is so good. good luck and \nhave fun.",

Everything said \non this video has been said about the Mazda, and is what I feel driving it. \nThe book performance figures are almost identical too.\n\nShortly after I got the MX-5 I was in the US and hired a Mustang \nconvertible (the 305 bhp V6). I loved it. It was a brilliant car, \nespecially for cruising, for the sun (we did the Keys, surrounded by \nMustang convertibles) and for a road trip. It was quick 0-60 (quicker than \neven the US MX-5 which has 10 bhp on mine), handled well and was \ncomfortable and easy to drive. So glad I hired it.\n\nCompletely different experience than  the MX-5. Not a patch on the Mazda \nfor road fun when the road is narrow and has bends. Nothing like it. The \nMX-5 (and by extension the GT86) is a driver's car. It feels like an \nextension to the body. Think and it is precisely where I thought about it \nbeing. I can feel everything happening to every wheel.\n\nFalling into an old pilot's saying about aeroplanes, the Mustang you sit in \nand drive; the MX-5 you strap on. I would love to strap on a GT86.",
