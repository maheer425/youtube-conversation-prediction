Those things \nprobably have their own clips and chat where you can hang out and \nmouth-fart.  Maybe it would save you time and us our sanity.  \n\nAnyway, this movie came out the year I graduated high school.  I rented it \non VHS from Blockbuster and watched it probably five times.  I never did \nreturn it, so that's probably why my credit is so shitty.\n\nThis is one of two films that I watched before I read the book.  The other \nwas Requiem for a Dream.  The latter book experience was kind of fucked for \ndoing so.  Trainspotting, on the other hand, wasn't.  In the edition I \nbought there was a dictionary of Scotch argot at the end.  It's a microcosm \nyou can get lost in, and I recommend everyone do so at least once.\ufeff",
