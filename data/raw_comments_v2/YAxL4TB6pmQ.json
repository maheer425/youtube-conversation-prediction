A car costs \nmore to have if you don't have money. It may not be the thing you want but \nyou'll probably have to consider to get rid of it.\n\n- Don't buy stuff you don't really need. This includes snacks, soda, \nalcohol, candy etc. If you cannot get by, cutting down on these will help a \nlot. It may be lonely on a weekend without something, but you'll sleep good \nknowing you're not in debt.\n\n- Turn off all electronics when you're not using them(i.e away from home). \nThis includes the power led on your TV, stereo etc. Don't leave your \ncomputer running when you're not at home. Also make sure you don't have any \nlamps running.\n\n- Switch out those old lamps for energy saving ones. Their life expectancy \nis generally higher and you'll save money on the electric bill in the long \nrun.\n\n- Make a list of groceries you need and if you can, buy them from day to \nday. This ensures, if you live fairly close to a convenient store, that you \ndon't have to throw away stuff you may not eat. If you live far away, \ncarefully planning your run to the store and what you need to buy, is far \nbetter than going in there blind. This saves money!\n\nWhile you do all this your health may improve as well, as you're active a \nlot more than before. Now you eat and buy only what you need and can afford \nto put the little money you have over into savings for a rainy day or a \ntreat.\n\nI understand what it's like to not have much, it's not fun and can be \nfrustrating to not be able to treat yourself with something now and then. \nBut when you don't have any money, it's time to let go of self indulgence \nand think smart.\n\nHope these few tips helped someone in need out there.\n\nCheers!\n\nAnother thing I came to think of, this probably will hurt the most, but \nit's one of those things that will help you get by, financially, easier. If \nyou own a pet, letting it go may be the right thing to do. Maybe ask a \nrelative to take care of it until you get back on your feet.\ufeff",

E.g. at home I don't remember seeing anyone write out a \ncheck in my lifetime (25) , where as I have American friends my age who use \nthem to this day.Regardless I'm still quite shocked by the systems \nexplained in this documentary.. In case anyone is interested allow me to \nsummarize this from the Dutch perspective. It isn't perfect either but it \ndoes seem more practical and even fair (as far as basic access/utility of \nbanking goes). If you are bored already please save yourself the TL;DR \neffort ;)\n\nSo I live in the Netherlands. In order to have a private bank account as a \nnon student, you pay an estimated \u20ac1,75 to \u20ac5 of a service fee per month, \ndepending on the bank of your choice. The primary banking card used in the \nNetherlands is an ATM/debit card, Credit Cards have always been a secondary \nchoice for the Dutch though it is growing in popularity largely due to \ntraveling and non-Dutch online stores which don't include a debit card \npayment option. Paying with a Debit card in a store, or making digital \ntransactions through the banks internet banking environment (which every \nbank has) is free/included in the above mentioned service fee and possible \nthrough your smart phone or your web browser. If I'mm not mistaken, in \norder to get a bank account in the Netherlands, all you need is to be a \nDutch citizen or have a valid visa/social security number. If  you can \ndemonstrate a steady income (1 salary transfer is generally enough) you can \nincrease your limit depending on your income. As an example I could set my \nlimit to minus \u20ac1000,- (max=monthly salary) which won't cost anything as \nlong as you maintain a positive balance. If however you dip below \u20ac0 you \nwill have to make sure you top off your bank account back to 0 and pay the \ninterest over the amount you 'borrowed' for the duration that you did. \nThese interest rates are relatively high (~12-15%), but after all debt \nshould be avoided where possible so some discouragement is probably \nwarranted. \ufeff",

We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody \nhas to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to \nMalthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have \ninspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to \ninspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to \nschool and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before \nsomebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.\u201d\n\n--Buckminster Fuller\ufeff",

In most states a 2 year degree fulfills \ncore requirements and can transfer to a 4 year school. Take a credit load \nthat's not too heavy and work full time. Live with your parents and save \nevery penny you can.\n\n2) Transfer to a 4 year school, but do your last 2 years over 3-4, part \ntime, pay as you go and work a full time job\n\n3) In this time, get a checking account and keep a solid minimum in there. \nGet a FingerHut account to buy holidat gifts as well as birthday gifts, \napply for their credit, pay it off in full before due date\n\n4) Graduate college. Get a full time job or advance in your existing one. \nSave up and purchase a used car\n\n5) Apply for credit with a store like Value City Furniture. Get 12 months \nterms, get your basic furniture, and pay twice the minimum before the due \ndate\n\n6) NEVER pay your utilities late. Ever. Use only a cell phone, look for \napartments with free heat, don't leave TV/Computers?lights on 24/7\n\n7) Start a savings account. Get a 401k through work, but on your own open a \nsavings account and each paycheck pay in until you save 6 months expenses\n\n8) Get a credit card. set a budget for entertainment (restaurants, movies, \netc) per week and pay with the card. Pay the abalance in full, each month, \nBEFORE the due date. By now you have a PERFECT FICO of 850\n\n9) Don't marry anyone with a FICO under 600, and no debt that will take \nthem more than a year to pay off\n\n10) Get your partner's debt paid off before marrying\n\n11) Share an apartment, apply for a car loan for a new car (not expensive) \nand pay it in full or more before the due date.\n\n12) Consult with a financial advisor on a mortgage you can actually afford. \nDO NOT SPEND A PENNY MORE\n\n13) Bump up your 6 months savings while house shopping\n\n14) Buy a house, keep up on the mortgage, pay the balance due every month \nbefore due date or on due date\n\n15) Once savings is accumulated, consult financial advisor on when you can \nafford a child. Sat a new savings for their college expenses\n\nIf everyone did this, there would be no payday or car title loans, no \ncrippling debt. Do this and you have perfect credit, a newer car, a house, \na responsible spouse, emergency funds, and a plan for the future.\n\nWHY THE FUCK IS THIS SO HARD< AMERICANS?\ufeff",

The plan you have is for a most likely a white middle \nclass family that is actually middle class, with two parental incomes \ncoming in, that are allowing you to live in their house rent free with no \nbills. And for many people that is not the situation they have. Around me, \nits mostly low income, poverty families who tell their kids(I mean high \nschool grads) there moving to a smaller place to downsize but don't have \nroom to bring them so they have to find their own place. So from that \nperspective it's unrealistic. And also, its not so easy to save money. Cost \nof living has increased, cost of supplies, food, products, has increased, \nwhile hourly pay has either stayed the same or decreased. I know minimum \nwage is increasing but that is no where near enough for someone to live on \ntheir own. And while you think, oh they just have minimum wage right now, \nthey'll get a raise eventually. You're wrong. Companies aren't giving \nraises like they used to, because everyone's trying to survive.. People, \nbusinesses, companies, are just making by(except for the few). Even Target, \nthey used to give great bonuses and yearly raises. They're not giving them \nunless they have to, bcuz of minimum wage increase. So please your plan may \nbe great on paper but its not that easy. And if it was for you, then good \nfor you but I don't think its fair for you to make a solution for the whole \npopulation, when everyone has different circumstances.",

We had two cars and a \nhouse that had a room for all and much other room to spare.\nI live extremely simple- I don't eat out either and I watch my food budget. \nI enjoy this but it is choice. Usually each meal I make is around $2 and I \nonly eat twice a day(choice).\nBut this is really being conscience about my spending- I figure more then \nthe average.\nIf you assume a family of five and each meal is $3 three times a day times \nfive is $45. Round it up because you splurge once and a while $50, so for \nthe year this is $18,000. This is more then I live on all year(by choice). \nAnd that's just food and that is also being very careful about your \nspending. \nSomething has to give soon- I believe 1/3 of the US is on food stamps. \nAmazing stat considering we are or were the richest nation. \nMaybe its time we rethink our communities and push for more co-op worker \nowned local. Seems with all the big stuff all our money is spent on labor \nfrom overseas at stores owned by huge conglomerations that suck the money \nout of the community and into some off shore account. \nYour not alone.
