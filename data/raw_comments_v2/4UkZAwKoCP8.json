What \ngrates on one's intelligence is the continuous reliance on intrusive \nexperimentation using other creatures. This is surely counterintuitive; the \ninsight acquired by restricting one's input to suit what is actually \nrequired ought to discourage these exceptionally stupid experiments; \nparticularly since they suggest insignificant to useless \"benefits to \nmankind\" can be extrapolated from them; eg longer life.\n\nIf one's real intelligence can find ways to acquire a strong sense of the \npresent, in tandem with a healthy disrespect for these misplaced \nintellectual exercises, we can claim real \"progress\" and not give a damn \nfor the myth of \"longevity\", rather than that imposter should simply remain \nin the domain of collective scientific text, like a donkey carrying a load \nof books. When you boil it down pragmatically, however altruistic it \nsounds, making a heavily committed living this way, is the motive, \ncollective and personal.\n\nI aver that one can find, after sufficient study, a strong sense of the \n\"present\" \"reality\", following my ( text only ) video \"THE QUIESCENT MIND - \nSIMPLE MYSTIC FREE APPROACH\" ( see also latest comments ); and have \nexperiences that the alcoholic drinkers, smokers and drug takers seek, but \nnever fully obtain, due to the conflict between nature's metabolism and \ntheir alien destructive effect. There is no denying one's \"best interest\" \nis in the preservation of oneself, since it works out for the most logical \nbalance of nature, that isn't so much discerned as a phenomenological \nconcept in itself; it just gnaws at our primitive pysche with a true sense \nof its gross lack of concern for, and true understanding of, life itself, \nin all its \"forms\".\ufeff",
