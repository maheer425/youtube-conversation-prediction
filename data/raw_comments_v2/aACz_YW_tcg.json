            "text": "Around 5 years ago when I was 15 (not sure exactly when it was) My mom was \nin an abusive relationship with my sociopathic stepfather which she \ncouldn't get out of, because we'd moved all around the country, our \nrelatives all have a big grudge etc. so we had nowhere to live if they had \nsplit up\n\nBack on point: my mom went to her old friends house to have her tarot cards \nread and my older brother by 1 year Danny, went with her, I was home \nplaying computer games and my stepfather was somewhere in the house just \nbeing a prick as he did.\nWhen my mom came home, my mom was talking about it to my stepdad and he was \nhaving a joke about it sceptically, Dan said he felt kind of sick and down, \nbut he didn't know why, suddenly he broke down crying badly, and when my \nmom went to console him, he screamed and pushed her away, claiming that he \nfelt something grip his spine. He said that he felt my moms pain.\n\nBaring in mind that my brother is a hard nut who went to a young offenders \nprison, used to constantly get into trouble with the police and even armed \nsecurity back on the barracks we used to live on, prior to that house (my \nstepdad was in the army) he was used to being shouted at, beaten and \npunished.\n\nSo why did he start bursting into tears and going crazy literally an hour \nafter my moms tarot reading?\ufeff",

The lights were out and there was this documentary \non TV about alien abductions that they fell asleep watching. When I was a \nkid, I was really scared of alien's for some reason so I was laying there \nterrified to begin with. Also I was laying on the very edge of the bed, \nnext to a large window with long drawn curtains. \n\nWell all of a sudden, the TV turned off by it's self. So it was pitch black \nin the room and my heart was about to beat out of my chest.  After a few \nminutes, I hear a woman's voice call my name from behind the curtains. It \nsounded like she was singing my name.  Till this day, I still can't explain \nwhat the hell that was and it scares the shit out of me. I still wonder. \n Im 24 now.\ufeff",
