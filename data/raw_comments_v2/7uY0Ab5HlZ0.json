Have you \nseen Dubai or Hong Kong??Those Asian cities are beating American cities in \narchitecture. When I look at LA today and the city 10 years I seriously do \nnot see much difference. You do the same with Dubai and you are astounded. \nThe Burj Khalifa is not just tall but its GORGEOUS. America might have been \nthe pioneer in high rise construction. But today, people have borrowed \nideas from the Americans and they are doing it better. There is no need to \ntalk about American superiority complex buddy. USA as well as Canada have \ninnovated in science and technology which spread all over the world. So \nwhats the big deal!! My point was Toronto has a great skyline!!",
