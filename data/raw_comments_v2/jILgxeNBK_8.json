The limitations of the zoning, combined with the needs of the \ncommunity determine what is the best business for that property - and often \nthe type of biz that could flourish in that specific location limits it to \njust two or three different biz's.

The watch shop must draw on a whole \nmetropolitan area to stay afloat and therefore locates at a center of a \nlarge city. Don't be so quick to denigrate consumers or producers, this is \none of the few areas where the economic equilibrium is not optimum but \nlooked at more broadly the stores will locate in a way that most \nefficiently distributes land.",
