            "text": "+13thVaRebel To them golf is not just some game, its a 'lifestyle' meant to \nset the privileged artificially above and seperate from everyone else.  Who \ncares if that nearby community needs clean drinking water? Keeping the \ngreens green is so much more important...so let's tap into that aquifer and \nfuck everyone else over.  They are so oppressed b/c they don't have water \nrights to keep them 'happy' vs. people who need what they carelessly \nrecreationally abuse to actually survive.  Keep tapping, who needs \nhydration right?  And heaven forbid actually having to pay more for a \nvoluntary activity that uses up clean water necessary for survival, farmer \nshould realize he's just fucking his own business interests over.   \nhttp://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2014/05/30/golf-course-owners-on-short-end-of-water-rights-decisions-in-california-drought/",
