As a foreign listener \nwho does not understand the Korean language, I find that Kim Bum Soo is the \nmost amazing artist who can digest any kind of music genre, crosses the \nlanguage barrier and touched his listener\u2019s heart as he sings with his \nheart and soul. His detail technical skills are just awesome in all music \ngenres with various singing methods and various voice colour. Being the \nfirst Korean artist to enter the US Billboard Hot 100 music chart at 51st \nposition in 2001 with no youtube at that time and despite his tripled crown \nstatus being able to perform at prestigious Sejong Centre, Carnegie Hall \nand Sydney Opera House which is many singers\u2019 dream, I must agree to \nlooloos that Kim Bum Soo is still underated internationally.  He deserves \nmore attention so I just want to say Bum Soo, keep fighting!!!\n\nNote: Ms. Lee (Hui Son Yi) is Kim Bum Soo's mother. He called and spoke to \nhis mom at the end of the music video. With the help of a Korean friend, \nhere is the translation of their sweet conversation:\n\nKim Bum Soo: Hi mom, I want to have your home made food.\nMs. Lee: Home made food?\nKim Bum Soo: Yes.\nMs. Lee: ok. I will cook as much as you want to eat.\nKim Bum Soo: Mom, I miss you.\nMs. Lee: I miss you too.\nKim Bum Soo: I love you.\nMs. Lee: I love you too.....\ufeff",

I \nbought a Maige TV box so that my friends and I can watch him live on KBS2, \nMBC, Mnet TV, tvN, etc. although there are no English subtitles but it does \nnot matter as he crosses the language barriers . He sang \"Eyes Nose and \nLips\" in his Seoul solo concert in October 2014 but not in this costume. Yu \nHuiyeol's Sketchbook was his second performance. He is a multi-dimensional \nperforming artist! This \"Jibap\" MV is also on Mnet TV. Love his 8th album. \nHe sings with wonderful detail techniques. His falsetto voice is higher \nthan a soprano and is in the comfort zone!. He is not only a colourful \nvocalist, he is a colourful composer! Hope that he keeps composing as well. \nPlease visit http://forums.soompi.com/en/discussion/115407/kim-bum-soo/p17 \nIt is all written in English.

He is already appearing \nmore on TV through reality shows and I think it really help a lot. Let us \njust hope that more people will use their heart and ears to listen to music \ninstead of using their eyes. My instant reaction was to salute to him after \nhe finished singing \"The Lord's Prayer\" in the Korean language at the \nSydney Opera House using the bel canto method. I was going OMG! OMG! He was \nperfect! It takes years to train. How did he do it? He is amazing!! His \ntenor voice is so angelic in another form and colour. It is my dream that \nhe will be chosen to sing the national anthem at the opening of 2018 Winter \nOlympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea if a vocalist is required.
