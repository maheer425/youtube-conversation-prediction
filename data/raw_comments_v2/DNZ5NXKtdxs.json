If all the things that happened, \nhadn't, Elizabeth probably would have liked Darcy a lot sooner, rather than \njust being attracted to him, and trying to avoid him.\n I think, without realizing it, she felt attracted to him, that is why she \nwas so hostile in her words towards him, because she wished that the man \nshe felt a connection to wouldn't hurt the people she cares about, and ends \nup hating herself for her feelings towards him. She didn't act on her \nattraction. And just because you think someone's attractive, doesn't mean \nyou like who they seem to be. So when a girl says \"You're so sweet.\" at \nleast she sees his character right away, (and when some girls say that, \nthey are waiting for you to take action.) unlike someone who, lets say is \nlike Wickham, and you are attracted, to him because he seems \"Sweet and \nMysterious.\", and you get slapped in the face by a bucket of cold, harsh, \nreality and realize he's a jerk who messed with your emotions.\nElizabeth had been attracted to Darcy the minute she saw him, you can't \nhelp who you get attracted too, it's just a small, sometimes torturing, \npart of life. Some people are ashamed of being attracted to the wrong \npeople, so don't just think all woman want to throw themselves to a guy \nthey like. Also, if at the end of the day a guy is complaining about a girl \nnot having feelings back for him, and how she's an idiot for not choosing \nhim, since he is supposedly the \"Nice guy\", than I would rather disagree \nand say he is the one who does not deserve her. Because even \"nice guys\" \nhave been liked by the \"nice girl\", and that \"nice girl\" had her heart \nbroken too. It's just life. You don't get to force someone to make what you \nthink is the right decision. Or at the end of the day, you are the wrong \nguy.    And I know it's hard to believe, but you cannot fit all woman into \none tiny box, we could do the same, and I believe we probably already do. \nEither way it's not right on either sides. ",
