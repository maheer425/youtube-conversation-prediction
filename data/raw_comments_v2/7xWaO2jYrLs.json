Having State Troopers intimidate people \nattempting to get voter IDs is voter suppression. Sending out purposefully \ndeceptive mailers only to Democrats is voter suppression. Sending \norganizations with documented histories of illegal activities like \"True \nthe Vote\" to polling places to intimidate voters is voter suppression. \nUsing a program like Checkpoint in 21 states to purge voters from voting \nlists is voter suppression and a major felony. 40k voter registrations \nmissing in Georgia and a Secretary of State who says he has no obligation \nto accept any registrations he doesn't want to is voter suppression. \nMoreover, most of this is felonious activity. Voter suppression is real and \nit's the main reason the GOP swept so much. Anyone who denies it's real is \ncognitively dissonant, being paid to say it's not real, or guilty of it. \n(Like this SOS John Galt below.) \ufeff",

PS the claims of \"rampant \nvoter fraud\" have been debunked time and again, including by members of the \nGOP when they tried to prove the need for it! Example: Iowa's AG did a two \nyear study to prove illegals voted. He found 5 instances of voter fraud \ninstead, all felons who voted before their rights were restored. Which I \nmight add, is the most common form of voter fraud (per numerous studies)",
