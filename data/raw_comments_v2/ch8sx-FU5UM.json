I ordered the Making it Wayne T-shirt on 11th July and three weeks \nlater it hadn't even been shipped. Therefore I had to open a dispute via \nPayPal. Thankfully I got my money back. But I haven't received an apology \nor acceptable explanation from SharkRobot. Therefore I reccomend that if \nyou see a T-shirt on the Game Lut episodes and they are made by SharkRobot \ndo not buy it or alternately buy it from another and more reliable source. \n\nHappy Gaming \nThatemulatorguy \ufeff",
