He got fucked up at 140 ( if you disagree with me the \nfacts are in his fights) and he hasn't proven anything at 147.

He has fought nobody's apart from Shawn \nporter and it seemed like Brook was forced into fighting him to get any \nkind of recognition in the sport. If he didn't have a title right now \nnobody would be even mentioning his name cause he ain't a proven champion \nand has done fuck all in boxing compared to Khan. Khan should fight more \nelite opponents? Khans faced, Peterson, Garcia, Maidana, Barrera, \nMalignaggi, Judah, Mccloskey, Kotelnik, Barrera whereas Kell brook is \nfighting guys like Jo Jo Dan and now Frankie Gavin (these are low calibre \ndomestic and European level fighters).... you would of never of thought he \nwas IBF champion. Thurman is a good prospect but has yet to prove himself, \nhe fought a blown up lightweight in Robert Guerrero (but I still give him \ncredit for that fight it was a decent win) and a 40yr old man in Leonard \nBundu. If people like Victor Ortiz are allowed to face Mayweather why can't \nKhan he has faced many world class opponents and his resume shites over a \nlot of other fighters.",

Manny is small and past his \nbest (still dangerous) but of the 3 Khan, Thurman, Manny you have to think \nthat Mayweather will pick Manny. Amir is far too fast, big, strong, and \nyoung for a 38 year old Mayweather, so is Thurman.\n\nI expect Mayweather v Paquiao for September (if either fights again) and \nKhan v Thurman around the same time.

Also Mayweather \nis no way knocking out Amir, his last Legit TKO, was 8 years ago now \nagainst Ricky Hatton in 2007. Floyd is not a big puncher and will no way KO \nKhan , oh and Amir has arguably the fastest hands in boxing, and has never \nbeen outboxed in his professional career so if Amir and Floyd were to fight \nI'd put my money on Amir.",

Did u not see how washed up Guerrero gave him a fight \nfor 12rounds ? That's embarrassing. I'm not \"hating\" just pointing out the \nfacts about khan. Prescott ain't shit and khan didnt even last 2min ! Danny \nGarcia is a real boxer and you saw what happened. Now u just had the nerve \nto say khan will out box Floyd ?

Let me tell you , first of all Amir \nKhan is British and secondly it is America who is giving him every \nopportunity to excel. What Pakistan have given him so far?. Also i must add \nthat  If you belong from a Non Muslim Minority then Pakistan is a Living \nHell for every Non Muslim. You are burnt alive and your are treated worse \nthan animals. But on the contrary it the Western Civilization that gives \nequal opportunity to all including the Muslims.\n  \nIf Amir would be in Pakistan then i am sure his father would remain a taxi \ndriver and he will be following his father's profession rather than chasing \nany of his dreams. \n So kindly come out of this ignorance. Kindly give the credit where the \ncredit is due. Britian is his home and without Britian in my view Amir is \nnothing. So learn tolerance, respect and dont try to hijack someone else \nachievement for your political benefits. Last but no least.
