I can think of at least two \nexplanations why that is unlikely.A more energy efficient civilization \ndoesn't translate into less total energy consumption 2 Even if a \ncivilization would move towards total less energy consumption, it's unlike \nthat it reaches that stage without first reaching a stage where they did \nuse more energy.

I don't believe this is the real issue here.\n\n(Sorry in advance for any mistakes i don't usually speak English)\n\nHere the problem ; (All theses points are ''as far as i know'')\n- The planet have to be exactly at the right spot from the sun, ''The \nGoldilocks Zone'' as far as we know.\n- The planet need to be of the right size, have the right ''spin''/angle or \neven a moon.\n- The planet need to have the right ingredients, water for example. But it \ncould even lack other minerals.\n- The planet have to produce a strong magnetic field, witch mean an iron \ncore or something producing it.\n- The planet have to be able to keep its atmosphere from bleeding out into \nspace over millions of years.\n- Life is complex and the chance/conditions for it to appear is extremely \nsmall or at least unlikely.\n- The planet has to be lucky enough not to encounter any disasters that \nwould eradicate life.\n- The first ''life'' would have to be lucky enough to survive its \nenvironment, it could just have died off for many reasons.\n- Complex multi-cellular life forms might not be as likely as we think, the \nconditions might be hard to meet.\n- Assuming life managed to evolved into complex multi-cellular creatures, \nit would have to survive extinctions.\n- The planet would have to be extremely lucky that no catastrophic events \ndestroy most of its life for millions of years.\n- The actual chance that intelligence/consciousness develop might be quite \na lucky throw of dices. \n- Even if actual sentient beings evolved, their chance or survival in a \nharsh environment is small.\n- If those beings formed a complex society, the chance of them destroying \nthemselves or the environment is high.\n- The chance of a natural event triggering massive extinction is high, they \nmight disappear before mastering their planet.\n- The universe is Huge, hell, space between planets is mind boggling on its \nown.\n- The chance we ''though'' of the same technology/ways to communicate is \nextremely small, imagine sentient ants for a comic example; they aren't \nlikely to communicate with light/radio waves if they use pheromones.\n- The chance that they live in the same time frame as us and near us is \nunlikely.\n- Even if it where easy to populate planets or even solar systems, there \nare WAY too many, looking for a needle in a hay stack is a breeze compared \nto that.\n- Space travel over huge distances might be impossible in a ''living being \ntime frame'' maybe possible for other form if life tho.\n- Even if they could communicate with us, have a similar technology, what \nare the odds a signal would be passing at the right time in that Minuscule \ntime frame and hit Earth when we are looking for it ?\n- These being knowing all that, would they even bother ?\n- Even if we catch something that might come from another civilization, \nwould they will be around by the time it reach us ?\n- Are we going to be around long enough to catch that one time/unlikely \nevent ?\n\nThe universe is infinite, so in theory there is a possibility all those \nevents could occur, there is even a possibility of life in two solar \nsystems right next to each others. But it is EXTREMELY SMALL. And that is \nan euphemism.\n\nWe might be lucky and find trace of life. But don't be naive, we will never \nEVER encounter intelligent life.\nEven if they where somewhat close to us, they could just try to avoid \ncontact with us.\nIf you can find my watch I've thrown into the ocean with a beach metal \ndetector, then i might change my mind. \n\nBut to me there is no doubts that life either exist somewhere else, at one \nor more places, or it has existed or will exist.\nLife feels like the way the universe found to prove to himself he/it exist.\ufeff",

Accordingly, it is assumed that \nthose civilizations 1) would have been searching for us for far longer than \nwe have been searching for them, and 2) they would have far greater \ntechnology to be able to explore space and find us than we have.\n\nWhy has that not happened even though we have only been searching for \nothers for 50 years? That remains unanswered even if you assume we have not \nbeen listening long enough, and assume that we are searching for signals in \nways which are different from the ways in which the signals are being sent.\n\nIn 13+ billion years, there are a lot of opportunities to miss each other? \nThat's incredibly silly. That also means there have been a lot of \nopportunities to notice each other even if just by chance.\n\nOne way to be sure you never hear from other civilizations is to not \nlisten? That's illogical. If the other civilizations wish to make \nthemselves known to us, they could get our attention regardless of our \neffort or ability to listen.\n\nIt is possible other civilizations exist, are capable of making themselves \nknown to us, but do not CHOOSE to make themselves known to us. But without \na valid reason to think that other civilizations would act differently than \nwe act, there is no reason to think that all other existing civilizations \nwould actively avoid making contact. And with the millions of other \ncivilizations which SHOULD exist according to the Fermi paradox, it seems \nunlikely that all of them would choose not to reveal themselves to us even \nthough we have not spent enough time or resources in trying to find them.\ufeff",
