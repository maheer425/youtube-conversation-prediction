However, you're \nbeing extremely dishonest here - the old and new testaments call \nhomosexuality an abomination in the eyes of god, and the old testament \ncalls for the execution of gays. The same is true of the qu'ran and hadith, \nboth of which reference the execution of gays. Countless homosexuals have \nsufferered at the hands of religious tyrants over centuries, and it's only \nrecently that there has been tremendous push-back as the rights of \nindividuals have started trumping religious beliefs, and the churches have \nstarted adopting more tolerant views (in no small part to secular laws that \nprotect civil liberties of all citizens and curtail discrimination). \n\nYou're accusing me of having a more restrictive secular approach (which is \ngood for a laugh coming from a \"muslim\" blind to the vileness and \ndemonstrable immorality of the judeo-christian faiths), and yet tell me - \ndo you know which nations imprison or execute gays? \n\nHere's a nice map of intolance for you, color coded:\n\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/02/24/here-are-the-10-countries-where-homosexuality-may-be-punished-by-death/",

            "text": "+Keir Campbell Well, I'm afraid now you're losing me on some points. The \ngovernment can and does override god's law (whatever that law happens to be \n- so many interpretations exist). The people of faith can \"reject\" such \nauthority in favor of their god's, as you point out, but in doing so they \nwill face the inescapable consequences of their dissent.  As I said, you \nare free to believe what you want, but you are not necessarily free to act \nupon those beliefs, even if you feel that your god permits or even mandates \nthat you do so.\n\nYou also say persecution of homosexuals is \"reprehensible\", but in doing so \nyou yourself essentially override god's law according to those who hold the \nsincere belief that god views homosexuality as an aberration and that \nhomosexuals should be put to death as per the law laid down in Leviticus \n(again, whether that is actually god's law is immaterial - all that matters \nis that someone has the sincerely held belief that it is god's law). You \ncannot have it both ways then. You either respect anyone's beliefs and the \nconsequent actions and don't intervene, or you abridge the liberty to act \non certain beliefs. You elect to do the latter, and I'm with you on that.\n\nLastly, as a Westerner, I don't have much issue with those of faith \"hating \nthe sin\" as you or they like to call it (I still have a problem with it, \nbut it's not a major problem, and one I wouldn't particularly care to \ndebate). However, I will always take issue with anyone who acts on such a \nbelief in any way that would disparage, ostracize, ridicule, persecute, \nmaim, or kill another human being. ",

The \npoint is the people of that religion will reject any attempt at changing \nit, at usurping Gods word. \nI also think you're confused about where i stand in this: yes, persecution \nof homosexuals is reprehensible. persecution of religion, of skin \ncolor/culture, of sexual orientation, of ANYTHING is reprehensible. \nBut i also don't think that a religion saying \"no by our laws we cannot \napprove of or perform an Islamic same sex wedding\" is persecution. to FORCE \nthem to do it is persecution in my eyes. \nBut as you say, we agree on the key points, which are : be nice to people. \ndont hurt them just becuase they love someone with the same parts.\nAs we say in Islam, you can condemn the sin and still love the sinner. \n(although i must confess being a westerner i don't condemn homosexuality in \nthe way most would think, rather i acknowledge the rules laid down in the \nQur'an.

Apparently, you do agree then that you in fact do NOT have the right \nto act upon all religious beliefs - only those that don't do damage to \nsociety.\n\nAlso, note that I am making a very important distinction between beliefs \nand actions, and that one should be tolerant through actions, not through \npersonal thoughts. The government cannot act as thought police and force \nindividuals to accept anyone. However, the government can certainly hold \naccountable any individual that acts on their beliefs, stemming from \nintolerance, in a way that is detrimental to certain citizens or to society \nas a whole.\n\nAs such, I think we're almost in agreement on all the key points except the \nloss of tax exemption which you said you still have to consider.

While anyone can hold such a \nbelief, they are not permitted to act upon that belief in any way, \nregardless of whether they feel that their \"gods\" allowed or even mandated \nsuch actions. \n\nNote that the actual interpretation of how to deal with talmudic laws or \nwhether they apply to modern society is wholly irrelevant. There is no test \nfor the accuracy of one's personal beliefs and whether they even conform to \nscripture - it is only required that they are sincerely-held, and the \nbelief holders' imaginations can run wild and free. \n\nFurthermore, I presented to you a conditional statement - I said that \nchurches should be mandated to perform gay/lesbian weddings because of \ntheir tax-exemption status, which was instituted specifically because \nchurches offer valuable community service. If they start doing anything \nthat would go against tolerance or create division within communities, then \nthey should lose that tax-exemption status.\n\nI do believe that priests shouldn't be compelled to marry anyone, let alone \ngays or lesbians, but those priests should not be exempt from the \nconsequences of their choices. They don't live on their own privately owned \nislands along with their congregation - they are part of a secular civil \nsociety and are expected to give up certain personal freedoms, like the \nrest of us, to maintain tolerance and promote safety and well-being among \nthe populace.",

The government thus has a vested interest in the \nchurches spreading messages of tolerance and acceptance for their fellow \nman, and has made the choice of foregoing revenue so that society as a \nwhole may benefit. Discriminating against certain citizens goes against \nthat. I thus think that the churches should face a choice - be willing to \nmarry gays and lesbians, or lose your tax exemption. \n\nIt's time to make the faithful even more tolerant and accepting of fellow \nhuman beings. Leave the judgment to your gods if you're so certain of other \npeople's misdeeds or apparent \"sins\". Misdeeds or \"sins\" are labelled as \nsuch based on the judgment of those very gods, and not based on the \nstandards or morals of men and women who have empathy, compasion, and \npossess sound reasoning skills.",

I have a very very close friend whom i love \nvery much whos in a committed lesbian relationship, and if anyone tried to \ndeny their life together based on their body parts i would be first to jump \nup in their defense.\nThat said, i also know that our religion teaches that in the context OF OUR \nRELIGION, same sex marriages are not to be preformed .the right to practice \nyour religion is just as important as the right to marry who you want. \nWhen ti comes down to it, both are the same issue. supporting freedoms of \npeople to live however they like, as long as its not going to infringe on \nthe rights and safeties of others.\n\nAnyways, if you STILL can't comprehend what i'm saying, you're a lost \ncause. why don't you try getting off tumblr and using your head ?",

Gay \npeople can have as much sex as they want and there will be no conception. \nSo it is not even an equality issue!\n\nCivil partnership that cover next of kin,tax etc. of course... but things \nthat apply to couples becoming pregnant, what the fuck? that has no bearing \non gay people! \n\nWith the family court system being so messed up, secretive and biased \nagainst men to the degree a mother can lie and be a total sociopath, and \nget away with it! then to suggest adding another group. one that people \nthink supporting is a badge of honour, added into that... clearly being \nanother force against biological fathers... no way!  \n\nOn the brass tacks, full marriage is completely based in the fact sexual \nrelationships between men and women can lead to children being born, this \ndoes not apply to same sex couples at all. So to say not giving access to a \ncontract based around two people conceiving to same sex couples is absurd. \nAnd, before going on about people who are infertile, having children is not \nan obligation of marriage, it is to provide a protective structure should \nchildren be conceived, it is based around conception from sexual activity.\n\nSaying it is just about love is absurd, \n\nSort our the family court, sort out fathers rights, fathers are much more \ndiscriminated against in law than gay people, kick out the feminists from \nthe LGBT... get a society where people \"judge\" gay and straight people \nequally and their is no ego boost to being pro gay... where a judge can say \nwith pride they ruled in favour of a lesbian couple over a biological \nfather to much praise... first things first!\n\ncivil partnership, yes... full marriage, when two people of the same gender \nconceive through sex, that can happen accidentally... this stone cold idiot \nis using it as an ego expression, he is a reason to oppose it.\ufeff",

What that means \nis, we allow the homosexual person to come into the church and we treat \nthem just like everybody else. But just like everybody else, if they have a \nvice and we know it we are to show them in scripture where it says it is \nsin. In this case, we would show them the following text for one example:\n\n\"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.\" \nLeviticus 18:22\n\nBut after that, if we know they are persisting in their homosexual \nbehavior, two brethren of the faith are to approach them about it and if \nthey will not change, they are to be escorted out of the church. At this \npoint we would make them aware that we want to see them back but they must \nfirst change this behavior. Now then, we still love them even after we've \nescorted them out and explained that it is not in our belief to allow \nsinners who are *living* in sin knowingly and consciously to remain in \nattendance.\n\nnow, if you don't agree with the above, please note that there are terms of \nendearment for all organizations in life. just as we don't allow the nudist \nto show up nude for church, just like the military doesn't let you wear \nsocks on your hands and your gloves on your feet, just like the medical \ndoctor doesn't let you play with his MRI machine, just like your parents \ndon't let you run out into traffic, just as you don't dance gangnam style \nat a funeral or have a staunch democrat join the republican party. there \nare prerequisites and rules in this world in all walks of life and if you \ndo not agree with these rules that exist before you enter any of these \norganizations or businesses etc., then you shouldn't include yourself \nbecause we have rules in this life to protect us and keep us safe while \nother rules are to protect sanctity and group interests.\n\nTherefore do not be offended if your behavior or lifestyle is not \nappropriate for a group that you intend to join. (like church) it is not \nbigotry or discrimination, it was the rules long before homosexuality had a \nboom like we see today.\ufeff",
