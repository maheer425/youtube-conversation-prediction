Find me a fossil \nrabbit, human, dog, cat, elephant etc in the Precambrian rock strata or \nJurassic rock strata or in any other rock strata in which evolution \npredicts it shouldn't be found.

We have seen \nthings rearranged to form something else. Eg. wood glue and nails used to \nmake a table. The table did not come from the wood glue and nails. Wood, \nglue and nails were simply rearranged into what we label a \"table\".*\n\n*So PLEASE provide clarity on what you mean when you say \"everything had to \nhave come from an intrinsic source\" and give me examples because I have no \nidea what you mean.*\n\n\"In terms of the \"1000's of peer reviewed scientific journals\", have you \never considered the fact that the earth was created as if it had existed \nfor eons.

Old-Earth supporters like to \npoint out how we can see light from stars much further than 7,000 \nlight-years away.
