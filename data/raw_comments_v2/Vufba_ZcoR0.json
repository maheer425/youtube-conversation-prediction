Historical \nperiods are much complex and looooong term than simple events such as a \ngeographic discoveries, wars or revolutions. So the renaissance was a \nthing, because as you said, it was \"a lot of mutually interdependent things \nthat ocurred over centuries\", and let me add, in a particular part of the \nworld: Europe (mostly Italy but also Western and Central Europe.) Your \npoint of view is just anachronic: just because the renaissance seems like a \nvery long period of time, much longer than recent historical events (like \nthe creation and development of the United States), doesn't mean that \"it \nwas not a thing\" (WTF does that mean anyway?!) With that argument you can \nalso say that classical antiquity or prehistory, that were much longer \nperiods than the renaissance, were neither \"a thing.\"\ufeff",

If you can \nprove that something actually happened and that it was markedly different \nfrom the time period before it, then it existed. The Renaissance definitely \nhappened, and it was definitely a time of shifting in the arts, philosophy, \nand the humanities in general. It is definitely the time period in which \nthe classical arts of Greece and Rome were rediscovered and the \nsensibilities of the humanities definitely shifted away from medieval \nscholasticism and other medieval sensibilities. What is undeniable, and \nwhat I think John Green is getting at, is that our classification of a time \nperiod is an oversimplification. I don't know if historians even are \nintending to deceive, or if their classification is as nuanced as it should \nbe, and the way that classification is taught comes across as \noversimplified, because we are trying to teach relatively stupid people \nthings, and they need things simplified for them. Even if the Renaissance \nonly affected 5% of the population and didn't affect all disciplines of \nsociety, it still happened. I can see what John is saying: if you walked up \nto a farmer during this time period, and asked him if he agreed that he was \nliving in the Renaissance, he might have no idea what you are talking \nabout, especially if neither farming nor any of the aspects of his life had \nchanged. Periodization gives too much of an impression that all things \nchanged in a period and were all encompassing, as if every single thing had \nchanged from one era to another. It is better to think of periods as trends \nthat became en vogue and popular, and then faded out. While these are on a \nmuch smaller, less significant scale, I have lived through the grunge era \nof the '90s and the emo era of the 2000s, and it is easier to think of \nperiods like that. Did every aspect of my life change? No, but some of the \nmore conspicuous things like music and fashion did. So did some of the \nsensibilities, philosophies, beliefs and pieces of technology. However, I \nam largely the same person, and people are generally the same from period \nto period, if they live that long. \ufeff",

The Renaissance \nwas much less a \"historical period\" and more of an intellectual and \nartistic revolution that happened in the course of three centuries. One \ncannot say that \"It did not happen\" because quite simply it's effects were \nimmedietly felt in the scientiffic and intellectual world. For example \nErasmus was invited  to the court of the Holy Roman Emperor as a councilor, \nDante and Cervantes became celebrities only a few years after their deaths, \nShakespeare was read by the Elizabethan nobility, the frescos and statues \nin the churches were open for all too see. True, the effects of the \nRenaissance would not mature untill the 16th century, but arguably by then \nthe European world was already ready to leave both classical civillization \nfor good and go towards an \"Age of Enlightenment\". Thus while the \nRenaissance was not an event like a battle, it was certainly an event in \nintellectual and artistic history that had ery little to do with outside \nsources such as Muslim or Theological writtings and more to do with the \nprofessionalization of secular sciences and arts.\n\n\nAlso, I'm a leftist but sorry John Green but even I can't accept this \nrevisionist history that the Ottomans somehow aided to the coming of the \nRenaissance. If anything the Ottomans were the reason why the Italian \nRenaissance declined. Most of the trade exports of the Italian city-states \nwent to central and western Europe. The prime materials for this trade to \nbe possible came entirely from the mediterenean through the Indian Spice \ntrade. The Venetians and Genoans facilitated this trade by way of their \nGreek colonies in the Agean and Ionian seas. This trade firstly abruptly \nended with the fall of Constantinople, which then was followed by the \nalmost total territorial loss of their colonies by the Ottomans barring \nthem completely from the Spice trade. Hence the insentive to discover India \nand the journey of Colombus.\ufeff",

The profound \nknowledge of the Nalanda teachers attracted scholars from places as distant \nas China, Korea, Japan, Tibet, Mongolia, Turkey, Sri Lanka and South East \nAsia.
