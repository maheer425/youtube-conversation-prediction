The second was worth 2 or 2^1, and it goes on 2^2, 2^3, \nwith the exponent increasing by one each time. This is going leftwards \nthrough the digits. Going right, the exponent decreases by one each time \n2^2, 2^1, 2^0. The next one comes after the decimal point and it is worth \n2^-1 or 1/2. Then the one after that is 2^-2 or 1/4. But 1/2 is 0.5 which \nis bigger than .1415926... So we put a 0 in that digit place. 1/4 is .25 \nand still we need 0. But the next one, 1/8 is 0.125 which is less than \n.1415926... so now we put a 1 in that digit place. Leftover there is \n.1415926... - .125 = .016926... and you can keep going like this. There are \nother faster ways to convert from fractional decimal numbers to fractional \nbinary numbers, but this works too.",
