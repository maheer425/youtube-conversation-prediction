Dahil kung si God nga ang nagpadala ng bagyong Haiyan, isa lang \nang ibig sabihin nito, alam ng Panginoon na ang mga PILIPINO ay malalakas \nat kaya naming pagtagumpayan ang hamong ito. Kaming mga Pilipino ay mga \nHUMBLE CITIZENS OF GOD, alam Nya na hindi kami bibitaw sa pananampalataya, \nat alam Nya na kaming mga PILIPINO ay ang mga likas na mapagmalasakit, \nmapagmahal, matulungin, mapagkumbaba, at matatapang Nyang tagasunod. \n\nKaya ang mga umiinsulto sa aming mga Pilipino ay sya ring umiinsulto sa \nPanginoon ng lahat.\n  \ufeff",
