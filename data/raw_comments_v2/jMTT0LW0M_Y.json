Marco Rubio   referred to Hillary Clinton as \u201cyesterday\u2019s \ncandidate.\u201d It is a theme he can use about Jeb Bush too as he tries to \npivot. Rubio, like Bill Clinton in 1992, is campaigning on a bridge further \ninto the 21st Century. As he does so, along with the other Republicans, \nHillary \u201cMadam Yesterday\u201d Clinton is going to keep finding yesterday\u2019s news \nhaunting her.\n\nIt was Hillary Clinton who presented a reset button to the Russians in \n2009. It was she who steered that relationship and heralded a much improved \nrelationship with the Russians.\n\nNow comes word of what that reset relationship looks like. Having given up \ntrying to get Iran to close some of its underground centrifuges, President \nObama now just hopes they won\u2019t make a bomb. But the Russians, with whom \nHillary reset our relationship, are now going to supply the Iranians with a \nsurface to air defensive missile system to prevent the United States or \nanyone else from blowing up the centrifuges with bunker busting bombs.\n\nThat\u2019s right folks. Hillary Clinton reset our relationship with Russia and \nnow Russia is supply weapons to Iran to ensure they can complete their \nnuclear weapon.\n\nHer reset had rippling effects that, even now, we have not yet felt.\ufeff",
