Plus in the comfort of your \nawesome office chair sitting isolated in your room, you are actually much \nmore likely to be focus and attentive than in the middle of a class room \nfull of noises, whisper, hot girls, hot boys and sitting in a crappy ass \nchair.\n\nYou can also pause and rewind stuff you didn't quite understand without \nhaving to stop a teacher in the middle of his speech and pissing off every \nother person in the room. You don't have to suffer awkward relations with \nother people like bullies and that one girl who mercilessly rejects your \nadvances. You don't even have to leave your home, the one place in the \nworld that feels the most familiar and secure or all places. Public schools \nare one of the worst environments possible to actually learn stuff. Back \nwhen we didn't had endless access to the entire knowledge of the human race \nin one single device; a computer with a functioning internet connection; \nschools were the best tool we could get to ensure everyone would have a \nchance to learn. They feel terribly outdated when compared to a channel \nlike crash course.\n\nBut I can't deny the quality of these videos. I mean I've gone trough 6 \nyears of college/university all about biology. I know all of this stuff \nhe's trying to teach and yet I'm watching it for fun! And perhaps a nice \nrefresher on the basics. It's such a nice way to keep the brain warm. Would \nI go as far as to say it's good enough to fully substitute actual school? \nFor some people, yes. Crash Course would be enough to substitute most of \nhigh school (Except maybe for maths. I didn't see a maths playlist. I think \neven Youtube can't make maths exciting enough...)\n\nThe problem with MOST people is they wouldn't want to learn this stuff if \nthey weren't obligated to at least give it a try by attending school. If \ngiven the choice, they would rather spent their teen years playing videos \ngames or sports, or both and hanging out with friends and losing their \nvirginity and making a bunch of dumb mistakes, some of which would get a \nfew killed, like starting one's home business in drug dealing at the \ninnocent age of 12.\n\nMost humans can't be trusted with choice...",

Then \nthe most efficient one ends up being prevalent simply because it happens to \nbe good at living ?\nThat's my understanding of natural selection, at least. You might know more \nthan me on the subject, I haven't taken a biology class in a while. \n\nOther than that, I find this symbiosis at the cell level quite mindblowing. \n\nThe whole idea of evolution and natural selection is quite \ncounter-intuitive, just see how some people still cling to \"intelligent \ndesign\". And even if you don't believe in the latter, when you look at the \nfine clockwork that life is, it is hard to concieve that it's the end \nproduct of a long chain of trial on error on a lot of levels. We want to \nthink that living things plan their evolution and make the new blueprints \nfor themselves, as we build machines.
