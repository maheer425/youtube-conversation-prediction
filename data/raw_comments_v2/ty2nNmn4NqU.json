            "text": "Rothenburg ob der Tauber\n\nRothenburg ob der Tauber is a town in the district of Ansbach of \nMittelfranken (Middle Franconia), the Franconia region of Bavaria, Germany. \nIt is well known for its well-preserved medieval old town, a destination \nfor tourists from around the world. It is part of the popular Romantic Road \nthrough southern Germany.\nRothenburg was a Free Imperial City from the late Middle Ages to 1803.\nHistory\nMiddle Ages]\nIn 950 the weir system in today\u2019s castle garden was constructed by the \nCount of Comburg-Rothenburg.\nIn 1070, the Counts of Comburg-Rothenburg, who also owned the village of \nGebsattel, built Rothenburg castle on the mountain top high above the River \nTauber.\nThe Counts of the Comburg-Rothenburg dynasty died out in 1116. The last \nCount, Count Heinrich, Emperor Heinrich V appointed instead his nephew \nKonrad von Hohenstaufen as successor to the Comburg-Rothenburg properties.\nIn 1142, Konrad von Hohenstaufen, who became Konrad III (1138\u201352), the \nself-styled King of the Romans, traded a part of the monastery of \nNeum\u00fcnster in W\u00fcrzburg above the village Detwang and built the \nStauffer-Castle Rothenburg on this cheaper land. He held court there and \nappointed officials called 'reeves' to act as caretakers.\nIn 1170 the city of Rothenburg was founded at the time of the building of \nStaufer Castle. The centre was the market place and St. James' Church (in \nGerman: the St. Jakob). The development of the oldest fortification can be \nseen: the old cellar/old moat and the milk market. Walls and towers were \nbuilt in the 13th century. Preserved are the \u201cWhite Tower\u201d and the Markus \nTower with the R\u00f6der Arch.\nFrom 1194 to 1254, the representatives of the Staufer dynasty governed the \narea around Rothenburg. Around this time the Order of St. John and other \norders were founded near St. James' Church and a Dominican nunnery (1258)\nFrom 1241 to 1242, The Staufer Imperial tax statistics recorded the names \nof the Jews in Rothenburg. Rabbi Meir Ben Baruch of Rothenburg (died 1293, \nburied 1307 in Worms) had a great reputation as a jurist in Europe. His \ndescendants include members of the dynastic family von Rothberg, noteworthy \nin that they were accorded noble status in the nineteenth century, becoming \nthe hereditary Counts of Rothenburg (Rothberg), later taking up residence \nin the city of Berlin where they were well known as jewelers until the \n1930s. Most members of the family disappeared and are presumed to have been \nkilled during the Second World War. Several of the von Rothbergs were laid \nto rest in a crypt located in the Wei\u00dfensee Cemetery, while two members \nemigrated to the United States during the Second World War: Elsa von \nRothenburg, 7th Dowager Countess (1893-1993) and Hans Joaquin Albert \nAndreas von Rothenburg, 8th Count of Rothberg (1913-1972). The family is \nsurvived by its last living descendant, Andrew Sandilands Graf von \nRothberg, 9th Count of Rothberg (b. 1972), who resides in the United States.\nIn 1274 Rothenburg was accorded privileges by King Rudolf of Habsburg as a \nFree Imperial City. Three famous fairs were established in the city and in \nthe following centuries the city expanded. The citizens of the city and the \nKnights of the Hinterland build the Franziskaner (Franciscan) Monastery and \nthe Holy Ghost Hospital (1376/78 incorporated into the city walls). The \nGerman Order began the building of St. James' Church, which the citizens \nhave used since 1336. The Heilig Blut (Holy Blood) pilgrimage attracted \nmany pilgrims to Rothenburg, at the time one of the 20 largest cities of \nthe Holy Roman Empire. The population was around 5,500 people within the \ncity walls and another 14,000 in the 150 square miles (390 km2) of \nsurrounding territory.\nThe Staufer Castle was destroyed by an earthquake in 1356, the St. Blaise \nchapel is the last remnant today.\nThe Thirty Years' War\nIn October 1631, during the Thirty Years' War, the Catholic Johann \nTserclaes, Count of Tilly, wanted to quarter his 40,000 troops in \nProtestant Lutheran Rothenburg. Rather than allow entrance, the town \ndefended itself and intended to withstand a siege. However, Tilly's troops \nquickly defeated Rothenburg, losing only 300 soldiers. After the winter \nthey left the town poor and nearly empty, and in 1634 the Black Death \nkilled many more townsfolk. Without any money or power, Rothenburg stopped \ngrowing, thus preserving its 17th-century state.\n19th century\nSince 1803 the town has been a part of Bavaria. Romanticism artists (e.g. \nCarl Spitzweg) of the 1880s rediscovered Rothenburg, bringing tourism to \nthe town. Laws were created to prevent major changes to the town.\nWhile buildings within the walled city reflect the city's medieval history, \nthis part of the city is in many ways a normal, modern German town with \nsome concession to the tourist trade. Many stores and hotels catering to \ntourists are clustered around the Town Hall Square and along several major \nstreets (such as Herrngasse, Schmiedgasse). Also in the town is a Criminal \nMuseum, containing various punishment and torture devices used during the \nMiddle Ages. For authentic Rothenburg ob der Tauber fare, one should have \nSchneeballen, egg dough fried, covered in either confectioner's sugar or \nchocolate.\ufeff",
