I've owned \nMKIV Supra Turbo with T-78 turbo, Evo 8 with 2.3 stroker, GT35R, and meth \ninjection, STi with GT30R, 350Z with built block and APS TT, IS300 with GTE \nswap, FD RX-7 with LS6 swap, etc... Damn, I can't even remember all of the \ncars. All cars were highly modified thoroughly(engine, suspension, hardened \nmounts and bushings galore, etc.).\n\nThen I drove a GT86... and I'm hooked so much that I am buying one!! Yes, \nthe power is low. In fact, it's been a while since I drove a car with an \nusable first gear. Hahaha. But the driving position, the feedback you get, \nand the way the car responds to your inputs... all together create an \namazing driving experience.\n\nI was one of those who kept criticizing 86 for the lack of power \ncontinuously since its debut. I hated Toyota/Subaru for not producing a \nTRD/STi version of this car as I thought I needed 300HP at the very least. \nBut after one drive, I get it. This car is all about the driving \nexperience. It is never about posting the fastest lap times or winning drag \nraces. If you want to compete with other cars, look elsewhere.\n\nIf I really feel the need to increase the power, there are plenty of \naftermarket options available. I think adding a supercharger is a great way \nto add power to these cars as it keeps the throttle response unlike turbos. \nEven if I wanted to add more power, I do not think I would want anything \nmore than 300HP, as I do think that too much power will actually ruin the \nexperience.\n\nIf you haven't driven one, go try it. Although you might not feel that this \nis not the right car for you, I guarantee that you will enjoy the \nexperience if you are a true car enthusiast.\ufeff",

Yes, it's faster in a \nstraight line and has a nicer interior, but it also does not have the \nsteering feel and balance of 86/BRZ. Make no mistake. 86/BRZ is slow in a \nstraight line. There is no denying that.\n\nHowever, well balanced chassis and great feedback is not something that can \nbe had by adding modifications. Yes, it can be done. But it is difficult \nand you might still never be able to get good feedback from the car about \nwhat it is doing. Lastly, 370Z is far heavier than 86/BRZ. By the time you \nmake 370Z as light as 86/BRZ, it will no longer have the nicer interior \nthan 86/BRZ, if it is even possible to lose that much weight and still be \ndriven on the streets.\n\nI know it is really hard to ignore the \"200HP\" as family sedans these days \nhave far more than that. Hell, my daily driver is more than 1 full second \nfaster than my BRZ to 100kph. However, adding power is the easiest part of \nmodifying a car. Setting up a balanced chassis? It is hard. Making the car \ngive good driver feedback? Nearly impossible with a car that did not come \nlike that from the factory.\n\nIt took me 3 years to overlook the power figures and give this car a \nchance. Once I did, I fell in love in an instance. I drove cars that had \nmore than 400 to the wheels in the past, and I still got hooked on 86/BRZ. \nTry it. Like I have mentioned, it might not be the right car for you, but I \nguarantee you that you will enjoy the test drive if you truly are a \nmotoring enthusiast.",

Since i've watched this video when it came \nout and also looked at the things you said here in particular I don't \nreally understand what you mean. The engine doesn't get weezy at all and \nfor sure not above 5k rpm, the steering definitely isn't the best but it's \nnot the worst either, and well the only thing I can understand in some way \nis the gear-shift as it does get a bit \"restrictive\" when shifting fast \n(not rubbery though). And the seating position in this video can't be any \nmore odd. The 370z has one of the best seats and one of the best seating \npositions for me of almost all sports cars i've driven so far. And the 8/10 \nhm not too sure as I was happily sliding when I was asking for it and going \nthrough corners rather stable when I didn't want to go all out. I haven't \ndriven a GT86 nor a BRZ yet since they're quite hard to test drive here but \nwhen I get the opportunity I'll compare the two even more closely :) The \nthiong I can say is that you should test drive all the cars first before \ncopying an opinion from someone else simply because in the end it's just an \nopinion ;) Cheers guys.\ufeff",

A brand new Cayman is not the fastest car in its price range \nas new models like the C7 Corvette, M4, 4c, etc all have better 0-60 and \n0-100 speeds I'm pretty sure..but why do car enthusiasts still purchase the \nCayman anyways? Because it has arguably the best driving characteristics \ncompared to those cars. That is exactly where the BRZ/FRS stands in the \n$20-30 K field. The \"used xxx\" over a new BRZ/FRS argument is silly as hell \nbecause one could easily tell you buying a new C7 is retarded because you \ncan get a C6 for a lot less money lol.

When I turn it off, I discover the Z's dirty secret: \nThose controls shut the car down before it truly gets good, and the harder \nthe 370Z is pushed, the better it gets. \n\nNissan engineers kept the car's weight distribution at 53/47 front to \nrear, which doesn't seem ideal for a sports coupe. The theory is that \nthe car's dynamic weight distribution \u2014 the balance when the car's \naccelerating out of a corner \u2014 becomes dead even as the load shifts. I \nbelieve it. With stability control on vacation, the car dives into \ncorners without a hint of understeer and when I get back on the throttle\nearlier, the rear hunkers down, grabs hold of the road, and pushes out \nof the bend with tremendous grip.

The 86 is going to be covered under \nwarranty, the Toyota is going to have lower insurance rates, and the 86 \nwill give you a chance to mature your driving skills while not putting you \nin a situation you may not be able to get out of.
