I can't tell you how many single mothers I've spoken with \nwhose ex-boyfriends have abused their children. When I inquired more about \nthese boyfriends, they had all the traits of sociopathy (or psychopathy) \nBEFORE the mothers introduced them to their children. Had they known the \ntraits- they could have prevented so much heartache. It is not their fault. \nThis subject is so confusing- WHO CARES! Just know the traits, because they \nare similar. Do they blame everyone but themselves? Are they controlling? \nDo they sometimes mix lies with the truth? Does what they say congruent to \nwhat they do? Do they gossip behind closed doors? Are they charming, \ngorgeous, talented, sexy, intelligent, and/or funny? They will use their \ngifts to disarm you and get into your psyche. Learn the traits of the type \n1 sociopath and you'll have a good idea about all of them. Type 1 \nsociopaths rarely desire to do anything illegal-just immoral. Good to know. \n:)\ufeff",

But for some \nreason they decided against it, even though over 40% of avoidants also have \nBPD. That said, even if you do show signs of both, they will generally \ndefault to only diagnosing you with whichever one you suffer from more \nseverely, and leave the other one out of the equation. So with me, for \nexample: although I have a history of mild self-harm and some issues with \nswitching from loving people to hating their guts and back again over the \nslightest things and in a way that they can find quite unnerving, I've \nnever actually been given a BPD diagnosis.

I remember \nreading about it somewhere as being along the lines that the difference \nbetween the two is: firstly, social anxiety is just one symptom among \nseveral with AvPD; secondly, a person with social anxiety is always looking \nat how others react to him/her and getting insecure about it, whereas a \nperson with AvPD is also looking at how he/she himself/herself reacts to \nothers' reactions to him/her and *also* at how others react to his/her \nreactions to himself/herself.... So it creates a kind of feedback loop \nwhich can get out of hand. Also, a social phobic, while insecure about how \nthey appear to others, may still believe themselves to be likeable people \nworthy of friendship and love, whereas avoidants really have serious \nself-esteem issues and have to struggle to convince themselves that they're \n\"good enough\" to do something as simple as, well, this act of typing a \ncomment here for example: we're hard-wired to expect people to hate us or \nto get angry at us. So...a lot of the time we just bottle everything up, or \nwe go to the opposite extreme and go out of our way to piss others off so \nthat at least we're in control of their rejection of us. It's pretty messed \nup and not a nice way to live.\n\"IN FACT social anxiety and avoidant have about a 60% co-morbidity \nrate!\"Very, very true \u2014 and I'm glad you brought it up: as I said, a \ncertain degree of social anxiety is like a symptom of AvPD anyway, and if \nit really gets out of hand then it can become a disorder in its own \nright in someone who has AvPD, which is how it is for me.Incidentally, did \nyou know that a lot of AvPD sufferers (including myself) are also \nagoraphobic? It makes sense: we're highly-strung individuals at the best of \ntimes, somewhat hypersensitive, and that ties in with the fact that many of \nus are easily overloaded by sensory stimulation; there's even a theory I've \nread about along the lines that it's linked to issues with things like \nbalance and proprioception and spatial awareness and so forth so that the \nworld \"out there\" appears more overwhelming for us than for most people. \nEspecially in crowds or in public places with lots of people walking about. \nThat makes sense to me since as a child I was pretty uncoordinated and \nclumsy and even now I carry a lifelong self-perception of being physically \nawkward (even though in reality I'm not *that* bad). So in my mind I equate \nsuch environment with the idea of being an accident waiting to happen and \nthat kind of reinforces my fears in other ways too.",

I have \nrepeatedly asked my students about if Hitler was 'crazy' (i.e. did he and \nmillions of others do as they did because they were out of their minds, \nthus not capable of acting rationally or deliberately, or were they in \nfull-- or at least most-- control of their actions and knowingly enacted \nwhat transpired, rending blame and cause fully within their laps). What \nconcerns be about constructing explanations for such behaviors in history \nis that the untrained lay person might envision this as an 'obvious' \n(NOTHING is obvious, in my opinion) explanation for cause, i.e. that 'they \nwere crazy'. I accept that entire swaths of fervent Nazi supporters likely \ndid have severe personality disorders, and that the unique manifestations \nof their ideas into industrial genocide reflected their general lack of \nregard for human life; mixed with overt self-glorifying mania that rendered \nthe Nazi political (and later war) machine as a fast-track for traditional \nsocial outliers. Yet I will not accept effects that are rooted in causes \nwhich, ultimately, are explained away as being outside the boundaries of \nhuman agency. Explaining and understanding figures such as Hitler, Stalin, \nor lesser known such as Islamic terrorists in France, the KKK, or Neo Nazis \nrequires more than seeing their behavior as being anti-social or outside \n'normal', and thus concluding 'they are crazy/insane/harbor a personality \ndisorder'. Human behavior, even behavior we might perceive as anti-social \nor outside 'normal thinking', is more relative than this video credits, and \nwe should also consider how culture, economy, happenstance, and environment \nall build into the construct that is a human mind.\ufeff",
