Plus, we don't have enough scripted well planned, \nand financed YouTube videos aside from music videos. I think that's why \nHollywood doesn't take YouTube seriously, so many YouTubers want to be \ncelebrities. So few want to be filmmakers. Guys like Wongfu and leading the \nway, but vlogs are master on YouTube. \ufeff",
