Its is made up \nof countries that are not states but have strong identity's that formed \nover even longer periods of time so are defacto countries.  The UK is a \nvery diverse place. England could also be split, as many counties have a \nlong history of their own such as Yorkshire and Cornwall that predates the \nformation of England.\n\nTo answer your question, yes London is the capital of the UK, it is also \nthe capital of England.",

One other query: not counting the other member \n\"countries\", isn't England itself an official country as it had always \nbeen, or did they redefine England to be one of the \"sub\"-countries, equal \nin status to its peers, with the creation of The United Kingdom?  I can \nsee, per your clarification, that the other member states are \nquasi-countries, but has England itself been \"demoted\" to \"quasi\" status \nwhen the UK was established, or has it remained a sovereign country as it \nhad been for centuries?  If it's the latter, then perhaps one can say that \nLondon is the capital in two separate senses; the capital of the Kingdom \n(the UK) and the capital of England (the country)...What say you?",

(they do not have powers over taxation for example). \nIt gets confusing as the UK government consider them countries even though \nthey have few of the powers which define a country in the legal sense.\n So the UK is basically a semi-federal state, they are essentially states \nwith limited  powers of self governance granted by the UK government (not \npermanent like states in Germany or the US).\n\nThe second point, Scotland can legally leave if UK government grant it, \nthis is because we do not have a codified constitution like the US. \nBasically this means that our constitution can be changed at any point by \nour government and it is not set in stone, so if Scotland voted yes we \nwould simply pass a law granting their separation from the state and it \nwould be completely legal (whereas in the US ammending the constitution \ntakes much, much more effort).",

So then, Gareth, is it as if to say each of \nthese \"countries\" (including England) are more like \"states\" or \"provinces\" \nwithin the Kingdom?  If so, if Scotland votes to \"leave the Kingdom\", \nwouldn't that be secession (and, thus, illegal)?  This is fascinating....",
