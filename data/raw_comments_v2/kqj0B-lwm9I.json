I had this absurd experience \nwhen a foreign girl who was like 3 years younger than me looked at me as if \nshe was flustered after knowing that I was like 2 years older than she \nexpected. So my point is that foreigners should not make assumptions of \nages of a Korean just by looking at their looks. There are some Korean \nactors than look 10 years younger than their actual age.\ufeff",
