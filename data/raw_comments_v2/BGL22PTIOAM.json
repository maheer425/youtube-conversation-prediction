I was exposed to literature (beyond \nbullshit assessments and timed essays, which are ridiculous in a completely \ndifferent fashion) by talking about video games with my English teacher.\n\nThe fragments given to us in classes aren't worth anything to exploration \nin fields we find interesting. And the worst part is, because you only \nscratch off a few paint chips from the all-encompassing mural of knowledge \nthrough these classes, finding something that REALLY interests you becomes \nhard. We have to go into colleges that actually focus on something in order \nto find something we wish to understand. The whole point of public \neducation in relativity to academia (that is, softening up all you'll need \nto learn for the big-kid stuff) is made useless by this model because \nthings are broken down to the point where there isn't any further interest; \nmost of the things people are drawn to in physics, chemistry, philosophy \nand math are \"too complex\" to be touched upon in high school, and it's a \ndamned shame.\ufeff",

Society, \nconsumerism, and our lust for the material have all contributed to our \ncurrent stupidity stripping us of our imaginations and sorting us into \nneat, little rows of replaceable numbers all trying to eliminate each \nother. Unsurprisingly so, when we consider we are constantly encouraged to \nhave others think for us, give us our questions and answers, and make our \ndecisions without our consent (Federal Government) And at the end of the \nday don't forget that piece of green-colored carbon: Greed.

The first SIX YEARS of our education is devoted to three concepts: \ncounting, addition, and multiplication. I get that six and seven year olds \naren't incredibly advanced, but they are good at learning and remembering. \nAddition could be mastered within a year without excessive stress on the \nstudents. That means other concepts can be learned sooner and more time can \nbe used for math that actually needs more time. Right now, most high school \ngraduates have no more math than PreCalc. PreCalc is when Physics joins \nwith math and the connection is made more clear. If we could learn more \nmath, we could learn more Physics! Foundations are important. In elementary \nschool, the sporadic science lessons boil down to three things: memorize \nwhat the teacher says, get an A on the quiz, and forget everything. Again, \nno real science until middle school, and even that is vague and \nsuperficial. There are some who would say that starting early would cause \nstress. Well, spending six years convincing students that education is warm \nand fuzzy and tests don't matter and then tossing them into the \nultra-competitive world is like sending a chihuahua into the woods and \nexpecting it to thrive. The only way to get students to learn the complex \nstuff in high school is to teach them early. Rant finished.\ufeff",

            "text": "*This is a little long.*\n\nI am 14, and I would really would love to learn all of this stuff. What \nsucks about school is that they don't teach you all of this amazing stuff \nlike Quantum Mechanics, but thank god that they show you how to write \nessays, not only in 6th grade, but also in 7th, 8th, and 9th. Literally all \nof my past English courses have taught me the same thing. I already know \nhow to use proper grammar, but I guess I need to learn it again next year. \nRather than take all of this English that I already know, teach me \nsomething I don't know, like *cough* Quantum Physics, String Theory *cough*.\n\nToday in school, we are learning how to research the internet and books for \nan essay. Although I already learned how to cite, find important \ninformation, find reliable sources, etc, TWO years ago. So thank you \nschool, for wasting one hour and thirty minutes on English skills myself, \nas well as most of my friends and pupils already know. Granted, there are \nsome things I did learn this year like, how to write in MLA Format, which \nis nice to know, but I probably won't be needing that skill in the future.\n\nNow I don't know what career I want. But the career I will want, will have \nabsolutely nothing to do with sports or English, In my case, Gym and \nEnglish Class. I do understand that Gym is to help students learn to live a \nwell lifestyle, but making students that are uncomfortable with their \nphysical activities and such. Making students learn proper grammar is \nnecessary and should be learned. it should not however be repeated, year \nafter year, even this year our English teacher taught us what a sentence \nis. Really? We've learned about clauses and such, years before this. \nOverall, the career I want to have might relate to Science or Music or \nsomething computer related. I am not saying English is not important, just \nthat they are not teaching the parts of English that ARE important. Instead \nof grammar and essays, maybe it would be nice to know if the student even \nwill want to use these English skills in the future. After college, I most \nlikely will never have to write an essay persuading a person why to find \nthe character in the story guilty. No job that I have in mind will require \nthat I do that, so why do it now? Just in case I change my mind? Sorry, but \nI doubt that I will, rather than go on to something much more interesting \nlike this.\n\nI would love to learn how to write LUA code, but I guess I'll have to learn \nthat on my own time. And what is funny, is that if my career ends up around \nthat skill, school work would have been a complete and utter waste of time. \nOther than helping me go to college, elementary - high school would have \nbeen nothing. If I go into video game programming or something that would \nrequire LUA, C++, or Html coding, that would help prove that school is \nwasting student's time. I have never learned to code in school, and it is \nsuch a shame, because I find it very fascinating.\n\nOne of the things I am grateful for school however, is for my advancement \nin mathematics, since I am one grade level ahead, and for teaching me my \nvast music skills. Without school, I would have not learned I can play five \ninstruments, or can solve Quadratic Functions and stuff like that a year \nahead of everyone else. That is the good that school has brought upon me. \nUnfortunately, it is very hard to learn Physics and LUA coding without \nsomeone like a teacher, to TEACH. Maybe school should focusing on basic \nthings everyone should know, and focus more on things like student's \ninterests for career pursing, maybe a student wants to be a professional \nathlete, good for them. Let them study Health as well as Anatomy, to \nunderstand the body, and give them Sports electives, to practice. I am not \nsaying they should not receive math classes, but only basic math knowledge \nclasses, instead of putting a student who does not like math in \nPre-Calculus, let them get another class that interests them, instead of \nhaving them fail the class they do not want to do.\n\nHave Math, Science, English and History, but only basic knowledge.\nA future Author does not need to know what the crusades were, and why were \nthey important. They need to know how to write better, and how to write \nwell to captivate emotion. Put them in English II, Expressive Writing, and \nsome other class they have an interest in, like Choir. Myself, for example, \nwould love to have classes such as:\nLUA Coding/Programming, Physics, Marching Band, Orchestra, and Pre-Calculus.\nI would rather not waste time in the Gym, learning how to play Badminton. \nGranted, I will be taking Pre-Calc next year in my Sophomore year, but I \nwill not be taking LUA Coding, because that is not a class, and I will not \nbe taking Physics, because Sophomore classes for science, do not include \nPhysics. Although I would need to take classes to build up to Physics, I \nhave no problem with that, rather than just take Earth Science in 6th, only \nto switch it up to Life Science in 7th, only to move to Physical Science in \n8th, only to move to Biology in 9th, only to move to Chemistry in 10th. \nAlthough some of these are important, such as Life Science, I fail to see \nhow I will use the study of environments and interactions, if I do become a \nphysicist. I do not know what prior knowledge is necessary for Physics so \nplease cut me some slack, thanks. \n\nOverall, school has become less of a \"Learn what you want to do, and become \ngood at it, and help the world by using it\" and more of a \"Learn what we \ntell you to, and learn less of what you want, even though you will not use \nmost of what we have taught you.\"\nSchool is now more expensive, thus reducing the chance of more people \nhaving jobs, adding revenue to the economy, and instead, increase the \nnumber of people on welfare, having governments pay for them. Although some \npeople, just don't like to learn, that doesn't mean that others don't want \nto. They just don't want to learn things that will be useless to them.\n\nEarlier I said that we learned to write in MLA Format. This rant is not in \nthat format, and it was still easy to read (hopefully). I would appreciate \nthe lack of hate, because this is just a rant, a rant from a concerned 14 \nyear old, worried and concerned about his future, the future of his \nfriends, and worried about the future of this country.\n\nNow how many high school kids have thoughts like this on their mind? A lot.\ufeff",

Also, I had a physical science class last year. \nThe textbook got through sixty pages on the nature of light without once \nmentioning the term \"photon.\"\n\n+Lycify Here's the thing: every class you take exists for a reason. It is \ndramatically easier to convince people that you are a credible, \nknowledgeable fountain of lovely, correct opinions if you can write a \nroughly nine paragraph, essay-like piece on America's broken education \nsystem without committing innumerable crimes against grammar and syntax. \nYour English class is intended for the maintenance of your democracy, \nbecause if you can't read at least secondary sources on current events and \npreferably primary sources and original research, or if you cannot persuade \npeople of your views, you cannot be an effective citizen in a democratic \nsociety. Similarly, your gym class is meant to increase your health both by \nteaching you how to do physical activity properly and forcing you to do so, \nwhile at the same time improving your academic performance (I can probably \ndig up some links to support this assertion upon request).\nAs for the not-at-all challenging curriculum, that's often called \"lowest \ncommon denominator\" education. It arises from the fact that students at the \nbottom not passing is something schools and teachers are punished for, but \nstudents at the middle or top being bored out of their skulls is not. \nRegrettable? Yes. An easy problem to solve? Nope.\nOh, and on the subject of lack of diversity in education: your language \narts teacher is not even remotely qualified to teach film or computer \ncoding. While it would be nice for those things to be taught, the funding \nto make that happen is almost never available.\n+LividMinecraft There is actually an extant reason for that language. \nPeople who speak different languages think in different ways. For instance, \nthose whose languages describe keys in the feminine tend to describe them \nas \"intricate\" and \"little\", whereas those whose languages describe keys in \nthe masculine tend to describe them as \"hard\" and \"jagged.\" (This also says \nsomething far beyond the scope of this comment about gender stereotypes.) \nAlso, linguistics, like math, can often be an exercise in critical \nthinking. Finally, being able to talk to people who speak other languages \nis kind of important.\n+Jonathan St-Yves I'm going to play the devils advocate here. In my school \ndistrict, 4 English credits are required to graduate with an advanced \ndiploma. You argue that these help to build up communication skills and \nbolster cultural understanding. However, we don't require music courses, \neven though analyzing the works of Beethoven, Armstrong, and even the \nBeatles would be valuable from a cultural standpoint. We don't require (or, \nin many cases, even offer) film and video courses, even though the works of \nHitchcock and Kubrick are classic, film is a massive part of our culture, \nand video is an increasingly prevalent medium for the communication of \nideas. Yes, solid courses in one's native language are necessary for a good \neducation in culture and communication, but they are certainly not \nsufficient, and it may be time to ask ourselves if that time could be \nbetter spent elsewhere.\n+Azure I live in the United States. Believe me when I say, you haven't seen \nanything close to our levels of exam-crazy. I had a math class fairly \nrecently in which most of what we were taught was how to use the \ncalculator. Our standardized tests are largely multiple choice, so to \nsimplify a radical, you first enter the radical into your calculator, then \nenter each possible answer, then the smallest answer that matches is \ncorrect. To solve an equation, you can dispense with all the fancy math; \njust enter each side of the equation into a separate equation in the y= \nmenu, hit graph, have the calculator find the intercepts, and you have your \nanswer. There's even an app automatically installed on the calculator which \nwill, if you input degree and coefficients, helpfully spit out the solution \nto any quadratic you will find on any test, including the standardized one! \nEasy as pie! (Until you get to higher math where the calculator isn't \nnearly so convenient, or have to use the logical reasoning skills you would \nhave learned had you actually done the math, or need to build off the \nknowledge that you should have gained but didn't because you weren't doing \nactual math).",

Not that the things we learn about how World War II \nhappened is useless, but the things we are required to write for exams is \nreally not related to understanding the events that happened.\n\nIn Singapore, we secondary school students are required to take a \n\"mandatory\" O-Level examination during secondary 4. History is one of the \nsubjects that are available to my school to choose for an elective \nhumanities subject. We are required to write long essays to explain how or \nwhy things happened (e.g. What are 2 causes of WW2? Explain your answer). I \nthink that the skills we learnt from writing the essay isn't entirely \nuseless, but i do think it doesn't encompass the entire idea of \"learning \nfrom past mistakes and to make sure similar mistakes won't happen in the \nfuture\". \n\nCertainly, i agree that writing about things like that would make you think \nabout the wrongdoings of the past, but honestly, most students will not \ngive a flying shit about preventing these mistakes, but to write out a \nproper answer that can fetch them 7 marks instead.\n\nI initially thought History would be fun, learning about how Hitler was a \ngood leader yet an asshole, but no. They teach us how to write essays, how \nto score as high as possible in exams, don't write this, don't write that \netc. I have friends who would very willingly throw away their human morals \nand values, just to get good grades and a good job. (p.s. He's really self \ncentered and has screwed up morals)\n\nMy point is, the entire learning system worldwide is flawed (or at least in \nSingapore). Students only really care about good grades and getting a good \njob in the future, hence MANY students don't give a shit about appreciating \nthe things they learn. This applies to ALL other subjects so far, so i \nreally think the learning system should be changed into a more learning \noriented direction, and not examination type of learning. Nothing we learn \nat school right now will ever be appreciated for its awesomeness, and that \nis what i really dislike about the learning system in my country.\np.s.

            "text": "> Overall, school has become less of a \"Learn what you want to do, and \nbecome good at it, and help the world by using it\" and more of a \"Learn \nwhat we tell you to, and learn less of what you want, even though you will \nnot use most of what we have taught you.\"\n\nSchool hasn't become that way. Public education was never about teaching \nyou what *you*, specifily, need to in order to help you further *your* \ninterrests. It was always about teaching you the basics of a little bit of \neverything. That used to be some reading and writing, and some maths. And \nsome craftsmanship for the boys, and some needlework for the girls. The \nheavy stuff was done by the rich aristocracy that can afford to spend \ndecades studying their interrests in foreign languages, history, material \nsciences, astronomy and so on. Nowdays, we no longer rely on some rich guys \nadvancing the sciences, but we still teach a little bit of everything \nbefore you have to commit to something. How would someone discover that \nthey actually love languages if they never even learned a second language? \nSo, you force *everybody* to learn a little bit about foreign languages. \nYou might already know that you want to become a programmer, but how would \nyou know if you really like biology and want to work on protein folding \nsimulations or whatever if you don't know the first thing about biology? \nAnd of course, there are all the people who don't already know what they \nwant to do in life. What are they supposed to focus their studies on?\n\nMaybe you just don't like english class that much, and that you don't learn \nnew things in that class. Well, there are philosophers, lawyers, \njournalists, advertisers, writers, secretaries, historians, public \nrelations managers and political science majors out there that *loved* \ntheir english classes. The opportunity to practice writing, learn about \ndifferent registers of language, read the modern classics that explore \neverything from politics and nationalism to morality and the challanges of \neveryday life.\n\nSchool can never be perfect, and your interrests might not be covered. But \nremember that langauge is *ancient*, and programming is *very recent*. \nSchools will adapt, and programming will be picked up by schools sooner or \nlater. It's good if you bring up that issue with teachers and other people. \nBut just because schools are a little behind the times, or some teachers \ndon't do a good job, or you really *hate* a certain class, doesn't mean the \nway schools work are fundamentally wrong. Because school today isn't even \nabout teaching you things. Shure, there are the *really* basic things that \neverybody needs. Reading and writing and some maths. But you grow up in \nshool. You get to socialize, you'll get to know how people tick, you get up \nin the moring to do your job, you learn how to work with people, and you \nlearn how to learn new things. If you actually remember stuff you learned \nin shool, that's a bonus.",
