Gravity is one of the four fundamental \nforces and a general property of matter, which means that all matter exerts \na gravitational force on other matter. Right now, I am exerting a \ngravitational force on you,and so is the Earth and even a far away galaxy. \nHowever, because my mass is insignificant compared to that of the Earth, \nyou can only feel Earth's strong pull. Now, if you recall the equation to \ncalculate the force of gravity between to bodies you will see that the \nfarther they are, the lesser their pull is. In the hypothetical case that \nyou were in outer space at a considerable distance from any huge amount of \nmatter, your body would wander slowly in space, and I say slowly because \nthere will still be a faint pull, which is the resultant of the sum of all \nthe gravitational forces exerted on you. If you wanted to experience real \nzero gravity, you woukd need to place YOUR CENTER OF MASS in the only point \nin the universe where the sum of all gravity forces sum up to zero. I hope \nI answered your question. If not, GO FUND YOURSELF XD if you know what I \nmean.",

All \nthis means is that the g-force inside the box is the same as if there was \nno gravity at all. Now, if gravity were not affecting the box and all of \nthe people inside, then they would head out in a straight line to deep \nspace, but since gravity is clearly affecting them while they remain in \nconstant free fall, then they must be following an orbit.\n\nTl;dr They experience normal gravity, they're still just in free fall. \nRelativity confirms that they experience the same laws of physics.",

Since both infrared and visible light are both forms of EM radiation, \nand infrared has a longer wavelength than visible light we 'glow infrared' \ndue to the fact that we're not hot enough. ",
