Not all of them, some \nare absorbed by the darkness and lose their grip on humanity as they \nplummet further into the abyss. But there are those few that embody true \nhumanity, they have their flaws and they make mistakes and have their \nregrets, but they still remember what it's like to feel intensely. And \ntheir past pain helps them connect to those who have yet to overcome it, \nand they never miss an opportunity to help those people. Just listening to \nJoey, I know he's one of these people. Some people may think his past is \nfucked up, that he's a horrible person for cussing like a sailor or having \ndone so many drugs, but he's still standing. Now he's clean, and he's \nconstantly trying to give back. Maybe not materially, but as far as \nemotional and intellectual investments go, he's breaking the fucking bank. \nMuch love to you Joey, you're a true brother to the end and I hope and pray \nthat one day I get to meet you, to sit down and learn what I can from you. \nTrue wisdom isn't always pretty, but the ugly truths are the most valuable. \nAfter all, not all that glitters is gold.\ufeff",
