While it \nis interesting that Mary's mother died shortly after Mary's birth, it is \nalso interesting that she herself was pregnant when she started writing \nFrankenstein.\n\nPerhaps she saw herself as a monster who had killed her mother.  Or perhaps \nsome guilt about her, and Percy's, original marriages caused her to fear \nthat the relationship would produce a monster.  Would the child be \ntainted?  Would she see the child as tainted even though the child was not?\n\nHow much responsibility can we take for our children?  Can we bring them \ninto the world for our reasons and not respect that on arrival they are a \nnew person, with their own needs (the monster's desire for a mate) which \nshould be respected?  If they are monsters, is it our fault or theirs?\n\nIf we fear monstrousness which is not there, because of guilt that we \nviolated divine law by bringing them into being (Frankenstein usurping God, \nor Mary and Percy violating their original marriages) what effect could \nthat have on the child?\ufeff",

He eventually attempt to make direct contact with the \nfamily, only to have the family run away in terror. \n\nWhen the monster confronted Frankenstein, it was in a cave and by \nblackmail. \n\nHis \"cousin\" was already married to Victor, and was murdered by the monster \non her wedding night. \n\nPlease support this comment so it might clear up some things from the \nThought Bubble.\ufeff",

I read for a while and didnt see anything \nlike this so I'm posting what I feel was missing in the video. \nThough the themes of extenal appearance and rejection were discussed there \nwas no mention of how that echoed Shelley's life in regards to education. \nShe was never formally educated but, according to Wikipedia and my gothic \nlit class, she made extensive use of her father's library and read all the \ntime. She was intellegent but would never have the respect of her male \npeers simply because she was a woman. The idea that the monster is \nconsistantly judged based on his appearance and not his mind or heart is a \nreflection of her own experiences in life. Also, the few oportunities she \nmight have had for deep female or maternal relationships ended before they \nbegan with the death of her mother right after she was born but also with \nthe death of her first stillborn daughter. Her step mother was also not \nkind to her and chose to educate her step sister and not her. Isolation, \nloneliness and rejection as a result of how you were born is a very strong \ntheme in the book, the monster for not asking to be a monster (or to be \nborn at all) and in her life as an intellegent woman in a world that \ndoesn't value her. She did not ask to be a woman but was still lonely and \nisolated as a result of it. Perhaps the monster's request for a bride was \nShelley wishing she'd had an intellectual female equal, a mother or \ndaughter, to share in her isolation. I really wish the video had touched on \nhow the book was a reflection of the isolation she felt from her male peers \nwho were unlikey to have valued her intelect simply because she was a \nwoman, something she did not chose.\n\nAnna Matthes\ufeff",

Personally I interpreted the books attitude towards the monster not \nas \"It doesn't deserve to live in this world\" but as \"It cannot exist \npeacefully in this world\". Throughout the book the monster is portrayed as \nintelligent, good natured (at least in the beginning) and even a little \ncharming if you consider his encounter with the old man, however in spite \nof these traits he can only inspire an instantaneous fear and loathing in \nthe people who see his body. Because humans are horrible the monster would \nnever be safe and because humans are horrible the monster could only come \nto hate us for our rejection. He is dangerous not only because he's strong \nbut because we would actively seek to destroy him and force him to defend \nhimself, and he can't live in this world because his knowledge that we \nexist but also that he could never safely interact with us would make the \nexperience unbearable. I've always read him as a sympathetic character.\nVictor is pretty much the only character that says that the monster doesn't \ndeserve to live but what he means is that he should never have created it, \nthat playing God was a mistake. He's also mostly influenced by his own \nguilt and shame at his own actions, not by anything actually about the \ncreature until it turns violent, which is pretty much (if not entirely) \nbecause of the way Victor treated it. Actually if you really think about it \nmost of what Victor says about the monster could be referring to himself. \nWhat I read from the story is that mankind is monstrous, especially when \nfaced with what it perceives to be a monster. It seemed like the characters \nwanted death as an escape from terrible hardship, not because they felt \nthey deserved it... well the monster did but that's because of all the \nmurdering and whatnot, he feels he deserves the death penalty which is the \npunishment for murder anyway.\n\nIt's entirely open to your interpretation as well though, I can see where \nyou saw that I just find it fascinating that we both walked away with such \ndifferent messages.",
