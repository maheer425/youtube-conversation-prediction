It's \nlike you're making a movie about Sweden and in background you have french \nmusic! Can you please change that, because it's not giving a complete \nfeeling about Croatia like it should have! Your background music is serbian \nor macedonaian, this is completely different culture, although it's near \nCroatia. I can understand why you might have mixed it up but please you \nshould change it.\nFor instance, Zagreb traditional music has a chanson feeling and influence, \nbut also austrian and mid-european sound\nChack this out:\nhttp://youtu.be/HFgAhEOzUJc\nhttp://youtu.be/Gb-bfZxkNlM\n\nCheers from Zagreb area :-)\ufeff",

The \nChristian Croatians stayed in the coastal areas held by Catholic Venice, \nand others stayed in the Northern Interior region of Zagreb because it was \nalso held by a Catholic Empire, Austria. Over the years Venice fell apart \nand most of Croatian land was occupied by Austria-Hungary then it merged \ninto Yugoslavia but the Croatians always sort of kept to those old Venetian \ncoastal borders due to the presence of Latin culture. That is why when \nYugoslavia was dissolved the Croatians claimed the entire coast surrounding \nthe regions because it was mostly populated by Catholic Croatian speakers.\ufeff",
