The word \"poufy\" offends \nme so much. And it really pisses me off when my friends with naturally \nstraight and thin hair complain and say they're having a bad day or their \nhair is all \"poufy\".  They don't even know the struggle. It takes me like 2 \nhours to straighten my hair because I have so much. And I can't even manage \nto do it on my own! This one boy would always grab at my bun and squeeze at \nit, the same to my friend. No matter how many times we'd tell him to stop, \nhe would continue to touch us. If we'd push him away or get real mad, he'd \nget all offended and everyone would see us as cold bitches.\ufeff",

I'm confident with it for \nthe most part but as soon as anyone says anything like \"your hair is just \nso frizzy\" or \"can I touch it?\" I scrape it up sooner than you can say \nAfro.
