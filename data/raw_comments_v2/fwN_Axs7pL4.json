I'm not saying that SM is good or fair- like I \nsaid earlier, JYP and YG are way better at treating their artists fairly. \nBut look at Sulli's situation: she was getting hate and even though she \nwasn't physically injured, SM let her take a break from promotions because \nshe wasn't feeling well emotionally. Watch the documentary on Star Empire. \nThey don't even treat their artists like humans.\nAlso, there are a few articles about Luhan's earnings so I'll just link \nthis forum post that has a source:\nhttp://www.allkpop.com/forums/discussion/205690/luhan-only-earned-498-000-usd-while-promoting-with-exo\n\nAnd yes, there are unconfirmed rumours that Tao is leaving EXO.
