We co-developed, supplied the uranium, and \nunder the terms of the Quebec Agreement, sanctioned the bombs of Hiroshima \nand Nagasaki. Although we decommissioned our arsenal of hundreds of weapons \nin the 80's, we are still capable.\nEver heard of Food Power?   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_power\nMuch like Switzerland or the USA, an invasion of Canada would be suicide \nfor the invader.  We are an armed population. One report shows there are 7 \nmillion citizens owning 21 million guns.  \nhttps://nfa.ca/resource-items/number-firearms-and-firearms-owners-canada\nDont dismiss potential.  A currently small military reflects nothing.  We \nentered WW2 with an army of 4300 full time and 51000 reservists.  We had 15 \noutdated ships in our navy and 19 modern aircraft in our airforce.   By \nwars end, we had the worlds 3rd largest navy with 471 ships, 4th largest \nairforce with 86 squadrons and 1.1 million Canadians voluntarily enlisted \nand served. Thats was 10% of the population. If 10% of Canadas \npopulation enlisted today, we'd have the worlds largest military.  Also \nimportant to note, most of the equipment Canada produced in WW2 \nwas provided to allies or those numbers could have been much larger. \nhttp://ww2db.com/country/canada\ufeff",

(10th largest \nin 2015 according to the IMF)  Nearly equivalent to that of Russia with a \nquarter of the population.  I have no idea where the misinformation about \nfracking came from but it is untrue, the overwhelming majority of Canadian \noil is extracted through open mine, in situ or conventional drilling.  \nFracking is more common with natural gas.  Lower oil prices have not \naffected much other then the dollar and future oil development investments. \nThe lower dollar has been a benefit to everyone except Canadians travelling \nabroad or making online purchases from outside the country.  Canada's \nranking in oil reserves is also misleading.   Considering that the \nAthabasca deposit has estimates of 1.7 - 3 trillion barrels alone, thats \nmore then the rest of the worlds proven oil reserves combined. \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athabasca_oil_sands\ufeff",
