The Navy's scrambling. Littoral \ncombat ships, Zumwalt class DDG, Gerald R. Ford CVN, etc. They've \ndecommissioned some of the Ticonderoga class cruisers, which I believe are \nvery effective! The loadout of weapons available on that ship are just \nunmatched. The next best ship in terms of available weaponry would be the \nBurke class destroyers. DDG-51 class.

But Romney is right in that we need more ships \nin order to be more effective.\n\nWe NEED 300 ships or more in order to operate effectively. This is the only \nthing that can stop the Chinese from effectively invading places like \nTaiwan. Because we have the best and most ships in the world.

If we wanted, we could \nhave more planes deploying from these carriers than some nations' entire \nair forces! Our new Seawolf and Virginia class attack subs are among the \nbest of the best. Russia's struggling to keep up with that with their new \nsubmarines. If we completely followed your idea, they'd surpass us pretty \nquickly.\n\nWhat we need is 300-350 ships. Not 1,000. Not 100. We need enough to be \neffective, but not so much that we deplete our resources over it. Please \ndon't blindly follow politicians just to get publicity.

            "text": "+David Vilt \nThree things are clear from delving into the charts and numbers in the new \ndefense budget that President Obama proposed Monday: The defense budget is \nlarger, and growing faster than it might seem; most of the growth goes for \nbig-ticket weapons systems like those from Cold War times; and the Army \ngets such a small share of the budget, compared with the Navy and Air \nForce, that inter-service warfare within the Pentagon is all but inevitable.\nAccording to the Pentagon's press release the proposed budget for fiscal \n2016 amounts to $585.3 billion. However, that\u2019s merely the sum requested \nfor the Defense Department. As defined by the Office of Management and \nBudget appropriations for \u201cnational defense\u201d also include the Energy \nDepartment\u2019s nuclear weapons programs and assorted items in various other \nagencies, which together add up to $35.6 billion\u2014putting the total request \nat $620.9 billion.\nEither way, the FY16 budget request is 4 percent above the actual budget \nfor FY15 (which amounted to $560.4 billion for the Defense Department, \n$596.8 billion for what the OMB called \u201cnational defense\u201d).\nHowever, looked at another way, Obama is asking for a much larger increase. \nThe Pentagon\u2019s documents divide the request in two parts: \"the base budget\" \nand the \"O.C.O.\" standing for Overseas Contingency Operations. OCO refers \nto wars that U.S. forces are fighting in Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan, and so \nforth. The \u201cbase\u201d refers to everything else\u2014money for personnel, weapons \nprocurement, research and development, operations and maintenance, and so \nforth, even if there are no wars going on at the moment.\nThe budget for OCO is expected to go down in FY16, in keeping with the \ntroop withdrawals from Afghanistan, from $64.2 billion to $50.9 \nbillion\u2014about a 21 percent reduction.\nThe request for the base budget, on the other hand, rises very steeply, \nmuch more so than the figures for the overall defense budget might appear. \nTo be precise, if Obama gets what he requests, the base budget will rise \nfrom $496.1 billion in FY15 to $534.3 billion in FY16.\n\n\n\nIntriguingly, while the Pentagon\u2019s \u201coverview\u201d briefing notes that it\u2019s \nrequesting a 4 percent increase in the total defense budget and a 21 \npercent reduction in the OCO accounts, it doesn\u2019t express the base-budget \nincrease in percentage terms, so let me do the math for you: It translates \nto an increase of 7.7 percent. This is enormous.\nIn other words, President Obama may be getting out of President Bush\u2019s \nwars, but he\u2019s investing a lot more money in the Pentagon.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving this increase in spending? It\u2019s not pay hikes (just 1.3 \npercent) or military personnel (rising only from $140 billion to $140.3 \nbillion). No, it\u2019s mainly weapons systems\u2014and, in that category, mainly the \nsorts of weapons systems needed for a big war against a major power: \naircraft carriers, stealth fighter jets, and submarines\n\n",
