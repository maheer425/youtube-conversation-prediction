The \nmoment of \"inertia\" (or rather area) that resists buckling is proportional \nto the 4th power of the diameter of the leg.  The length and weight that \ncause buckling together form a cube-square product, or 5th order power \nfunction.  Square of the length for the space of elastic instability and \ncube of the size for weight.\n\nEven then, the 5th-4th power law isn't anywhere near enough to match \nexperimental results.  The data is closer to being represented by a \n9th-10th power law.  Best of luck to you to find out what physical \nprinciples cause that.\ufeff",

I am German and sadly learned no language really \nwell in school, even though they tried it with English, which I already was \nrelatively good at (THANKS BOOKS :D ), and Latin, which you are even less a \nfan of than I was.\n\nSo, to make it short: Knowing more words makes for more nuances and \ndifferentiation between meanings (angst, fear, terror, horror, Angst, \nBeklemmung, ... From the top of my head). More thoughts on this you can \nfind almost everywhere, if there are people who have read George Orwells \n\"1984\" and who refer to the language \"New Speak\", which is basically the \nreverse, where you reduce the amount of vocab to reduce the complexity of \nthought in the subjects.\n\n\nI hope any misspelling, that may have occured, and the multiple commata at \nthe wrong places that surely are there, don't stop you from seeing my point \nand possibly even start a discussion/conversation about this, which I would \nprobably find interesting.\n\nSee you around and have a nice day.\ufeff",

Perhaps dividing kids by their abilities is \nnot such a great idea, but at the very least they should be seen for whom \nthey are, students with some academic abilities. for that matter everyone \nelse should have their uniqe abilities and skills be noticed as well. the \ngreatest crime our education system does (the norwegian one,) is that it \nsends every child down the same road in public school, never taking note of \nwhat they're good at,which in many cases leads to those students never \nrealizing their full potential because they are afraid of overachieving and \nbeing looked down on by their classmates. this is more of a cultural \nproblem than an academic one, but it does in many cases lead to being cast \nout socially. not the ideal solution either. \nI am curious to know what your thoughts on a good solution to this problem \nwould be. You seem to have an interesting perspective.",

There is a reason I hated secondary school, (several, \nreally, but that is another story,) and that is that I was far too advanced \nfor many of my classes, meaning I had to sit through curriculum I either \nalready knew or I could have learned far, far faster than what I was \nallowed to by the curriculum and teaching methods. you know what happens \nwhen you intellectually hold people back who need to develop their minds? \nthey can become depressed, unhappy, lose motivation, lose interest in \nthings they found fascinating before, and it can in extreme cases lead to \nsuicide. Still prefer that age group system?\nAnother thing regarding the weakest students together:\nThat is not quite how this would work, instead of being put in a \"weaker\" \ngroup they would instead pass on said subject until they're ready for it \nand placed in a group of fairly varying skill levels, but nothing like what \nour current systems are.\nNo one is equally good at everything, so you might be 2-3 years ahead in \nmath, and 2-3 years back in say English.\nThis would be a brilliant system in a perfect world, but that is not how \nthe world works. still a far better system than our current one though, I \nthink.",

One quick anecdote (if you'll forgive me)... \n\nI was absolutely terrible at math in school (always getting C's, D's and \nthe occasional F's).  Then much later (at age 26) I became a programmer... \nand for the first time, I realized how important math was since it's the \nlanguage of computers.  It could be a game where you're collecting items or \npoints or get life taken away.  Or it could be an office program or \nautomaton bot where you need to track workers hours or salary or \ncommissions.  Or you need to find patterns in a set of data, or convert \nanything to anything else, it's allll math.  It's aggregates, algorithms, \nalgebra, and calculus... math, math, math, math, and not just the \"stupid \nmath\" that you're forced to learn in school that has no realistic \napplication.  It's math that you need to master before you can upload your \nprogram to the apple store or cNet or wherever you want to show off your \nwork or make money.  Math is the life blood of every programs ability to \n\"think\" and come to life.  As a result, I literally became a math wiz \nalmost overnight (which I thought was impossible), simply because I could \nfinally see the POINT in learning this boring math stuff for the first time \never -- it was like a cloud lifted and I could finally see.\n\nRegardless of how you feel though, the 3 most important emerging jobs in \ntoday's economy are programming, robotics, and automation... yet we might \nas well be teaching \"horseshoe making\" in schools, given the fact that most \nof the lessons and electives taught right now are geared towards 19th and \n20th century economies (where they're \"neat\" to know, but will have no \npractical application for 99% of the students).  Programming should be \ntaught starting as soon as kids are old enough to learn, as it will not \nonly give them a skill that they can use in any job market, but it'll give \nthem motivation to WANT to learn so many of the sciences (where as \ncurrently the primary motivator is \"you have to learn it to graduate\" -- \nie. incentivized motivation vs. punitive motivation).\n\nJust my two cents though.\ufeff",
