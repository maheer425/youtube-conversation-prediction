If base 12 makes calculation easier, then base 210 makes everything much \neasier too because it's divisors contain every prime number before 10.\n\n3. base 12 has it's own flaws like 10/5 = 2.44444... or 10/X(10 in decimal \nsystem) = 1.24972497... .\n\n4. I don't think dividing by 4, 8, 12, 16, etc is hard. for example look at \n10: 10/4 = 2.5 , 10/8 = 1.25 , 10/16 = 0.625 , ... . It is just a kind of \nsorting the powers of number 5.\n\nin conclusion, I think the only reason people like base 12 is that it makes \ndividing by 3 less annoying and dividing by 4, 8, etc easier for their lazy \nbrain. but they don't know that it makes 5 just as annoying as 3 and they \ndon't know that it doesn't make math easier for them. It even makes math \nharder because they have to change the way they think.\n\nIf there was ANYTHING that made math calculations more simple and faster, \nmathematician would have found it much earlier than these annoying people. \nAnd they DID:\nBase 2 (Binary) is much more simple for calculations and computers use it \nbecause it's much more powerful.  Do YOU want to use base 2 ? No, because \nit's really hard to change from base 10 to any other base for calculations.\n\nIf you want to change the world, you have to make a remarkable discovery. \nSaying the earth is flat doesn't make it flat and using base 12 doesn't \nmake mathematics any different.

The genius of the metric system was how it \n*regularized* all the multiples of basic units and how they were originally \nbased on round fractions of known quantities (e.g. one kilogram was \n1/1000th of 1 cubic meter of water, a nice, decimal round number, although \nthis is less relevant now since more precising demands for definitions have \nchanged it to what is now just an arbitrary mass of a physical object, and \nthat is slated for replacement by a definition based on fundamental \nphysics.). With a dozenal instead of decimal system, you'd still want to \nuse the same idea of round quantities, only instead of having prefixes and \nmultiples for 10, 100, 1000, etc. you'd have them for 12, 144, 1728, etc. \n(10_12, 100_12, 1000_12, ...). The clunky \"imperial\" units are still clunky \nin base 12 because they are irregular: e.g. (the numbers on the right are \nbase-12, thus the _12 suffix) for lengths\n\n1 inch = 1_12 inch\n1 foot = 10_12 inch\n1 yard = 30_12 inch\n1 chain = 560_12 inch\n1 furlong = 4700_12 inch\n1 mile = 30800_12 inch\n\nWhile the numbers are rounder, mainly due to the initial multiple of 12 at \nthe 1-foot level, but they're still not EASY to compute with, as powers of \n12 would be: 10_12, 100_12, 1000_12, 10000_12 times some base unit (which \nwould make more sense for some dozenal system) would still be easier than \nthese. (E.g. to convert from yard to feet you still need a long division by \n3, which while it won't end up with a repeating fraction part in dozenal, \nis still harder than shifting the radix point.) The whole thing about \nmetric prefixes is if you have some complicated unit like (g cm/ks) and \nwant to turn to standard form (kg m/s) you just have to play with some \nexponents of 10 -- addition, instead of multiplication. Just shift the \ndecimal point. If you need large multiples of a standard unit, just throw \non a prefix and you just move the decimal point. So in a dozenal system you \nwould want to base it on powers of 12 to make most scale conversions as \nsimple as a radix point shift, with perhaps some extra prefixes for the \nfractions 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/6 which are easy in dozenal and would therefore \nprobably be commonly used.\n'\ufeff",
