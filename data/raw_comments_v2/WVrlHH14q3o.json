Their hearts beat faster as they \ndived\ninto the indigo ocean. Their mouths nearly fell open at the mesmerizing \nsight\nbelow. Dozens of fish swam everywhere. Queer plants were situated on equally\npeculiar rocks. The two boys explored the ocean feeling exceedingly \nthrilled.\nThey found an underwater cave. Feeling inquisitive, they decided to enter \nit. All\nof a sudden, there was a glistening flash of light. The next moment, they \nwere\nsprawled on their backs. They seemed to have reached a cove. \u201dWhere are we?\u201d\nAsked John. \u201dNo idea\u201d, Steve replied.\nThey removed their diving gear and set off in search of a cave. When they \nhad\nfound a suitable cave, they entered it. They were bewildered to stumble \nupon an\naged man wearing scruffy clothes. The bedraggled man gave a crooked grin.\n\u201dWho are you?\u201d questioned John skeptically. \u201cI am the spirit of an ancient\npirate.\u201d responded the man. \u201cDon\u2019t be frightened. I just wanted to inform \nyou\nabout the treasure.\u201d \u201dTreasure!\u201d the boys cried in unison. Their eyes lit \nup with\nenthusiasm. \u201cTell us about it!\u201d they demanded. \u201dAll right,\u201d the spirit \nbegan.\n\u201dWhen I was a juvenile buccaneer, I raided a Portuguese ship on its way to \nBrazil.\nMy mates and I collected the loot. But on our way to the Indian Ocean, \ntragedy\nstruck. Our ship caught fire. I dived into the sea, taking the treasure \nchest with\nme. I reached this island through a cave.

Even If endocrine \nglands are concerned, Thyroid Gland is the largest gland . \nThe pancreas, weighing between 85 to 150 g (adult), is a large elongated \ngland (12~15 cm long; 3~4 cm wide; 1.5~2.5 cm thick) located behind the \nstomach. It has both endocrine and exocrine functions. It secretes \ndigestive enzymes and sodium bicarbonate into the duodenum and secretes \nhormones into the blood. \n\nThe liver (25 cm long; 15 cm wide) is a reddest brown gland located \nimmediately inferior to the diaphragm, filling most of the right \nhypochondriac and epigastric regions. It has a tremendous variety of \nfunctions. One of the liver's exocrine functions is the secretion of bile \nthat contributes to digestion. In that sense, the liver is considered the \nbody's largest gland, weighing about 1.4 kg",
