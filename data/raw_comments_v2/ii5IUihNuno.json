In the third \"Twilight\" bad lip \nreading, a friend of Bella's gives her a book about moss (which was edited \nin by BLR). The author is credited to \"T. T. Tokyo\". Also, at the very \nbeginning of the \"Michelle Bachmann\" video, \"T. T. Tokyo\" is shown, for a \nsplit second, to be the cameraman. Check it out.\ufeff",
