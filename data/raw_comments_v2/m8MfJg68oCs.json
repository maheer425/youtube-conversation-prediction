Been an EXO-L since October \nand still find it difficult to point out Suho one of the members and get \nanother two mixed up all the time. If it helps I do have a couple tips for \nBTS members?\n\nV- usually has his tongue out loads during MVs and reminds me of a little \npixie or puppy. He has the deepest singing voice and never raps.\n\nKookie- usually has the most parts and has the sharpest jawline and \nsmallest features I think. \n\nNamjoon- the deepest voiced rapper with visible dimples when he smiles. \nDoesn't always sing but he gives me chills when he does so maybe you too. \nSort of husky singing voice.\n\nJin- look for big plump (and kissable) lips and big eyes.\n\nJ-Hope- long face and massive hands with long fingers.... makes me wonder \nabout his foot size lol\n\nJimin- nearly always in a sleeveless top. Look for obvious muscle \ndefinition with a high sweet voice. Does most of the falsettos remember.\n\nYoongi- has a slight squeak/lisp when he raps. Is small and very very pale. \nUsually wears a hat or something tied in his hair.\n\nHope this helps more but as we said it's okay if you're not positive. Just \nenjoy :)",

            "text": "+Ma\u00e9va Belieber Hi :)\nNames:\nJungkook/Kookie is the first one you see at his desk\n\nSuga/Yoongi (the one with the ball) and Rapmon(ster)/Namjoon who is beside \nhim, \nJimin's cleaning the bathroom, \nV/Taehyung with the manga or whatever that book is, \nJ-Hope/Hoseok/Hobie yawning, \nJin in the locker\n\n\n\nOldest to youngest (age to be this year): \nJin (23), Yoongi (22), Joonie and Hobie (21), Jimin and Tae Tae (20) and \nKookie (18)\n\n\nShort profile:\n\n\nNamjoon (D-A-N-C-E Monster/Appa Joonie)- the leader of the group and it's \nfather figure, main rapper, is very clumsy and so is known to break a lot \nof stuff/lose things, is perhaps the worst dancer and used to hate dancing \nbecause he was so bad (though I think he's pretty good). Also sings really \nwell and is known to cause eargasms with his voice and lyrics. See further \n'Trouble', 'Look Here' and 'Expensive Girl'\n\n\nJin (The Pink Princess/Eomma Jin)- loves pink, is the group's mother, is \nthe visual and considered the best looking, is a vocal liner (singer), is \nfamous for his shoulders, cooks to more or less chef standards and is good \nat the traffic light dance and the dislocated shoulder dance. Caused severe \neargasms in 'Trouble'.\n\n\nYoongi (#Swagmeister)- rapper line, writes a lot of his own raps/lyrics and \ngeneral songs for the group both on his own and with other members, is the \ngrampa of the group, you do not ever disturb his sleep (gf travel neck \npillow) can also sing and when really actively involved in Bangtan Bombs \n(search this they are great to get to know them) is great fun to watch.\n\n\nHobie (sweet and caring J-Horse)- dancer line but is a triple threat \n(sings, dances and raps), is known for his girl group dances with a \nparticular obsession for 'Touch My Body' by Sistar. does cute concept stuff \nbest in my opinion with especially cute noises, has a memorable 'dancing \nface', is the most caring arguably in the group and was nick named J-Horse \nbecause of the slightly long face. Particularly known touchy-feely person \nwho loves skinship with the others- particularly Jimin and Tae.\n\n\nJimin (The Body/Sweet Boy)- dancer line but also sings (he does all the \nfalsettos usually), has the best loved butt/thighs and over all body though \ninsists Jin's is better. Is known for his sweet disposition never getting \nangry for long and forgiving Kookie for not calling him 'Hyung' which shows \nhis older age and is tradition/denotes respect and therefore without is \ndisrespectful. \n\n\nTae (4D Alien)- vocal line, has a problem keeping his tongue in his mouth \nand has killer hip movements, is known for being a seriously outside the \nbox thinker with the members considering him an alien (lovingly not in a \nbad way), is generally really innocent aside from tongue/hip thing, loves \nacting and wants to be in a movie or something. Fans consider him the love \nchild of Daehyun from BAP and Baekhyun from EXO who are also aliens and \nlook very like him.\n\n\nKookie (the golden maknae)- is the baby of the group at 17 (18 in \nSeptember) which is why he is called the maknae, does everything really \nwell (dances/sings/raps/beat boxes/girl group dance leader...) I could go \non. School wise though if it's not music, art or p.e. he dislikes it. Is \nperhaps the sexiest when he tries to be which is bad news for noonas (older \nwomen) like me (I'm 22).\n\n\nKPop bands can be all sorts of sizes but usually between 4/5 and 12 \nmembers. EXO is I think the largest and had 12 and is now down to 10 (9 if \nanother leaves like I've heard mentioned). It is maybe the best known and \nis amazing. I can't tel you all bands but my favs are EXO, BAP, BTOB, Block \nB, Infinite, (BTS), Girl's Day, Sistar, T-Ara, SNSD, CLC, AOA and 2NE1.Plus \nTVXQ or DBSK who broke up a while back but I just love their songs like \n'Mirotic and 'Pictures of You'. Solo wise there is ?Erik Namm? and \nespecially need to check out Rain aka Bi-Rain. Anything from him is cool \nbut especially '30Sexy' and 'Rainism'. Rainism also has an English version! \nLots of the bands also release Chinese and Japanese song versions. BTS does \nnearly always- 'Danger', No More Dream', Boy in Luv.....\n\n\nCan't help specifically JPop though :(\nVietnamese wise there is Thanh Bui? a cover of 'Pictures of you' and \n'Danger' a remix with English with BTS. I think he wrote the song but not \npositive.\n\n\nSpecific songs to check out outside of those mentioned:\n\n\nAOA- Like a Cat, Mini Skirt and Short Hair\nGirl's Day- Something\nT-Ara- Suga Free\nBtoB- You're So Fly and Wow\nBlock B- Romantically, HER, Jackpot, Very Good, Nilli Mambo, Nalina and \nHalo.\nEXO- Call Me Baby, Growl, Wolf, Overdose, Black Pearl, Miracles in December\nBAP- Stop It and Angel\nBTS- I Need You, No More Dreams, (We Are) Bulletproof Part 2 (Part 1 is \nwith others), Coffee, I Like It (aka Pretty Woman), You're My, Beautiful, \nAdult Child, Cypher Part 1, Cypher Part 2 and Cypher Part 3, Attack on \nBangtan, Satoori Rap, N.O.... essentially everything from BTS (sorry major \nfan here so no pressure!)\n\n\nAlso watch some of the groups' interviews- on 'Weekly Idol' for example. \nAnd BTS has 'Bangtan Bombs' plus their shows American Hustle Life and \nRookie King. All easily found on YT with English subs and usually Thai/Viet \nas well.\n\n\nHope this helps!!!! Let me know sure what you think and if I can welcome \nyou into the KPop fandom.",
