But you \namericans are... and we, who are not allowed to have any of those things \nstill pay taxes so that you can have them. And then you use us for an \nexcuse for your laziness 'they are taking away our jobs'... Well, it aint \nmy fault that i am smarter than you, work harder than you and able to \nmanage myself better than you.\n\nP.S. - Its not that we are getting paid less for more, its you who wish to \nbe paied more for less.\n\nBottom line is, every single benefit that you have, even the smallest one, \nwe dont have it. But every expense that you have, we have it doubled. So \nnext time you see your probation officer, remember that somewhere there is \nthis immigrant boy who is forced to walk 10 miles a day to get to his \nworkplace and is paying all of his taxes on time so that you can have \nsomeone to look after you to stop you from doing something stupid again.\n\nIf there is such a thing as justice in the world, it sure as hell doesnt \nlive in america.\ufeff",

But the fact is that a huge % of the \nimmigrants here work (if they get hired) and pay taxes but have no rights \nto claim anything.\n\nAmerica does these programs where they target decent people from poor \ncountries. Put requirements such as medical check, background check, \nenglish skills and a level of education. You apply and if you get approved, \nyou come here. America knows very well that a lot of these people will \nchose to stay, and this is where it all begins. When their visa expires, \nthey have no rights to do anything, they are nobody untill they marry an \namerican citizen for papers. America knows that but still chose to do \nnothing, because it is convenient to have millions of people pay the same \ntaxes but get nothing in return, this way you have millions and millions of \npeople giving and giving without receiving.\n\nI have a small online thing going on (which i cant grow cuz they dont give \nme papers, and i refuse to marry for papers). Half of my revenue from this \nonline thing come from England, thats money that america has no claim on, \nbut still they dont miss the chance to remind me to file my taxes. And when \ni ask \"what about me, what am i going to get?\" the answer is all the same - \nnothing. So if i break my legs, i cant file for anything, if i decide to go \non drugs - i cant get a probation officer, if i decide to have a kid - i \ncant file for child support and have to pay the full price for giving birth \nand etc. It is broken, and they know its broken, but it is convenient. Why \ndo you think when they were talking about immigration reform nobody said a \nword about european immigrants? because even tho our visas expired, we \nstill pay taxes, which is why we are convenient, unlike others who cross \nthe border. Why do you think they got temporary legal status now? to root \nthem out and make them pay taxes, but when their legal status expires, they \nwill still have to pay taxes but be able to apply for nothing.",
