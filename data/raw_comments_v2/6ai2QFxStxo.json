            "text": "I sympathize with the desire to make a big, clear, sweeping claim, but I \nthink in this case the desire has lead to overreach. You are saying the \nbridge collapsed due to \"flutter\", which is a kind of positive feedback \nloop in which more deflection of a surface in a wind leads to more force \nleads to more deflection and so on. That's a great insight. But you are \nalso saying the bridge did NOT collapse due to resonance, which is at best \nmisleading. The flutter runs away because there is not enough damping to \ntake the vibrational energy imparted by the wind back out of the system. \nAnd THAT'S largely because the bridge begins vibrating at a resonant \nnatural frequency. You can see this with your own eyes in the video: the \nbridge settles into a vivid standing wave pattern. The key characteristic \nof such a resonance--just as you say--is that it allows more and more \nvibrational energy to be added to the system--by the wind, in this case. So \n'flutter yes, resonance no' is a bad way to think about it. Better to say \nthat flutter fed energy into a natural resonant vibrational mode of the \nbridge until the bridge collapsed.\ufeff",

I also happen to know a bit about wind effects on buildings an \naeroelasticity so I'm going to try to shed some light here.\n\nThe video was great, but it is a bit misleading because you say that there \nwas no vortex shedding involved in the collapse of the Tacoma Narrow bridge \nand that's not entirely true. In fact what caused the bridge to oscillate \nin first place was vortex shedding. This happened for several days and \nduring this lapse of time the bridge would oscillate in a vertical (not \ntorsional) mode. It was only during the last 45 minutes of its life that \nthe bridge started to vibrate in a torsional+flexural mode due to flutter.\n\nBut had not the bridge been oscillating due to vortex shedding in first \nplace, the aeroelastic phenomena probably would not have happened neither. \nThis is because the flutter was probably induced by some failure of the \nbridge(degradation of its torsional stifness and the failure of some of the \ncables) during its vortex induced oscillations.\n\nIt is true that resonance is not involved during  flutter oscillations, but \nit is believed that some kind of resonance/amplification was present at the \nmoment before the bridge collapsed. What caused this amplification is not \nwell known and there is some debate around it and several theories. From \nwhat I've heard about it, the torsional motion generated a vortex wake that \namplified the torsional oscillations but as I said before it is not clear \nand there are several mechanisms proposed in order to explain what really \nhappened.\n\nSo to summarize, the secuence of the Tacoma Narrow's fail was this:\n\n1. Vortex Induced Vibrations due to vortex shedding (vertical \noscillations). This goes on during days.\n2.Something goes down and flutter start kicking the last 45 minutes \n(flexural+torsional mode, no resonance involved)\n3.Shit happens. The torsional oscillations amplify itself due to some \nmysterious mechanism (probably vortex shedding were involved but it is not \nclear) leading to the collapse of the bridge.\ufeff",

On the day \nit collapsed, a cable band slipped, almost certainly because of this \nmotion. The slippage of the cable band led to the torsional flutter that \ndestroyed the bridge. Torsional flutter does not require the periodic input \nof energy from the wind that vortex shedding does but it appears that the \nvortex shedding was involved in the transition from the vertical motion to \nthe twisting motion. One can claim then that resonance did not destroy the \nbridge. However, if there was no resonance the cable band would not have \nslipped and the torsional flutter would never have started. That is why I \ngave the jumping off a cliff analogy. The vortex shedding and resonance is \njumping off the cliff, the torsional flutter is the sudden stop at the \nend.
