On a \nregular track, you want the car to be as stiff as possible (of course \nwithin reasons.. There comes a point where you don't want more stiffness in \nthe car, but that's another story) because a stiff chassis gives more \n(mechanical) grip to the car.. However, this means that the chassis don't \nflex as much as a normal road car, which means that every bump in the road \ngets reflected in the car much more, and makes the car 'sketchy' to drive \non tough surfaces - Like the Ring.. This also leaves more of the handling \nto the suspension - Also.. The car and the suspension is build in a way to \nensure as little as possible 'bodyroll' to make the car corner more \n'flat'.. And then there is the thousands of other reasons.. E.g. the weight \nof the car, the stifness of the suspension and anti-rollbars and so on :) I \nhope this gives you more of an answer to your question",
