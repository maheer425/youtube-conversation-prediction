He said Bigbang was his favorite and \nwhen we watched Win, he was inspired by them thats why he was the most \nhardworking among them three.\nUnlike those two, which the main motivation is just to sing on stage. Not \nhating on them though. But I have thought about this a couple of times. \nThose two isn't really fit to be a performer. Their characteristics are \nmore of a singer which does not need a lot of move and groves. Since they \nare both soulful singers. Ballad is what fits them more.",
