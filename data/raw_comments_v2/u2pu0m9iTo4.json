And since I've seen the \nreverse done with gay people saying gross when they are in sexual \nsituations with the opposite sex. Homophobic is not wanting to be around \ngay people or making fun of gay people. It's not you as a straight person \nnot wanting to be gay. Of course you wouldn't want to be gay if you're \nstraight just like a gay person wouldn't want people to think they are \nstraight. And even if we reverse it to be one straight woman and one \nstraight man they too wouldn't want to put themselves in sexual situations \nif they are already married to someone else or are jut friends. Either way \nwith any sexual orientation this scene would still be cheating because both \ncharacters are in a relationship with someone else. And of course they are \ngoing to start talking about \"manly\" things after that. What else is there \nto say? \"We're just friends?\"  No because in this point of the movie these \ntwo aren't even friends. They don't like each other to begin with.

A gay man \nkisses a woman he is like \"yuck. Sorry I didn't mean to do that. You know \nI'm gay right? Purses!\" It's not anti heterosexuality. It's only homophobic \nif the characters were making fun of a gay couple or if the gay character \nwas seen as inferior for sexuality or his gayness was something to laugh at \nlike the ending scene of Some Like It Hot where the man in drag finally \ntells the dude that wanted to marry him \"I'm a man\" then he response by \nsaying \"No body is perfect.\" I watched a glee episode where a gay man \nkissed a straight woman after the kiss he looks at her and says \"Gee \nthanks.

(c) and so it \ndefies the masculine stereotype. It's actually a clever piece of writing - \nthere's a precedent of male comedy duos sharing the same bed (Laurel & \nHardy, Morcambe & Wise, Bert & Ernie etc) but this presents the same \nsituation in a more realistic context. I often wonder - did John Candy \nmethod act this bit? Where was his hand, really?",
