            "text": "+Bidkar Salazar Thanks Bidkar! If you work on your car, you should get a \ndecent torque wrench. It allows you to set how tight the bolts/nuts are. \nHere is a video on how to use a torque wrench: How to use a Torque Wrench\nAs for your Honda and the torque specs, I would check the civic forums or \nget a service manual. That is where you will find the correct torque. I am \nsure it is something similar to what it is in the video. If you tighten the \ncastle nut until it is tight against the knuckle and then tighten it half \nof what you would tighten lug nuts, that is about 50ft-lbs. Make sure you \ndont back the castle nut off at all when you align the hole for the cotter \npin.",
