I see all the statistics in my analytics. I want you to go into the comments and type something, anything in your native language. The country that comes the closest to getting one comment for every one view on this video from your country gets international bragging rights FOR LIFE...or until I decide to do this again. You&#39;re all loyal theorists, but what country has the most loyal of loyal theorists? Let&#39;s find out. While you&#39;re thinking about what to write in the comments, I&#39;m just going to stay here and encourage you to subscribe...soooo you should do that. Subscribe. There&#39;s a lot of good stuff comin&#39; up. Like really, I&#39;m excited for the next couple months. And hey, click right here to start listening to my other Assassin&#39;s Creed video. It&#39;s one of those under-appreciated gems on this channel. Anyway, if you commented, subscribed, and watched the other Assassin&#39;s Creed video, you are now permitted to leave. Okay? Thanks!
