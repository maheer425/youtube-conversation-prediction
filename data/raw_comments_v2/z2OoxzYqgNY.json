But growing up they were more likely to walk \nfrom place to place instead of being transported by school buses and mom. \nThe latter situation is too common nowadays, and lots of teenagers - male \nand female - get cars as presents.

You can only get 16mm film \nin 3 x 4 format. He ended up with a 16mm movie with only have the frame \nbeing used which was then transferred to create 35mm prints.
