I would never support a puppy/kitten mill or pet \nstore which gets their animals from mills.  Most of my animals have come \nfrom breeders who raise all the animals in their home just as if they were \ntheir pets.  Always do your research on the breeder.  Ask lots of \nquestions.  Don't be afraid to ask to see the parents or see where the \nanimals are bred.  A good breeder will be very forth coming about all of \nthat.\n\nMy next pet I want to check out a shelter first but I specifically want a \npoodle.  Not a poodle mix.  I have owned and trained three poodles in my \nlife time and they are wonderful dogs.  Also, since I do all the training \nmyself, I like to start with a puppy.  All my cats have always been strays \nor given to the family for free but my last cat was bought from a breeder. \n I researched for nearly 2 years about bengal cats and finally got one.  I \nhad to go to a breeder.  Next bengal (which I hope to not need for many \nmany years since my cat now is only 3 and my last two pets, toy poodle and \ndomestic cat, lived to be 19) I will check out a bengal rescue first.  But \nagain, I train my pets, and bengal cats are super smart.  I got mine when \nhe was 13 weeks old and I've trained him.  He can walk on a leash, do many \ntricks such as roll over, and he knows many commands.  Anywho... the \nimportant thing is to give an animal a forever home.\ufeff",

But if you can't understand how it's irresponsible to add more \ndogs to the population, well maybe you should do some research yourself. \n Where I live anyway, shelters don't put down animals for no reason (maybe \nyou are thinking of PETA shelters)  they put animals to sleep because they \ndont have the space or funds to keeps them.  Especially where I live \nbecause people would rather go to a breeder because they think they'll get \na better dog, when really there are dogs at the shelter, sometimes from \ngreat quality breeders, sometimes from people who have died.  Breeders as a \nwhole add a shit tonne of dogs to the mix.  While I know puppy mills are \ndoing this too, they are doing it out of greed and wouldn't stop until they \nare shut down.  Breeders are more caring and could easily turn their \noperations into a breed specific rescue where people can still get the dog \nbreed they want without adding the the population, and also saving those \nbreeds of dogs from being killed at shelters.  Many breeders I personally \nknow in my area (dog, rabbit, and other rodents... I dont really know any \nother type of breeder personally)  Have stopped for this reason.  They \nunderstand that there are so many dogs they can be helping and see it as a \nbetter use for their time to help animals instead of producing more animals \nfor really no reason.  Showing at this point, is pretty much a useless past \ntime.   It takes many puppies to keep producing perfect specimens which are \njust sold off to other people.  So unless maybe it's a very rare breed, I \ndon't see the point.  Do your own research please.  I am very much in tuned \nwith every single type of dog breeder, rescue, etc.  I work at a vet office \nand shelter.  In conclusion, what I'm really trying to say is that people \nshould do MOST of their research into rescues when looking for a dog.  If \nthey REALLY can't find what they want (which really is rare if they did \nenough research) then do a tonne of research finding a good breeder that \nonly breeds their animals when they have guaranteed homes for them, and do \nlow levels of litters.  They should care about really health alone, \ntemperament come close after that and breed standards come after,\n\nHope this helps.  If you have any other questions, please use google \nbecause my hands are tired from typing :)\n\nCheers",

German shepherds aren't considered \nperfect unless they've got the slanted, weak back legs in the ring now, \nwhich is caused from inbreeding and only lowers their quality of life. Pugs \nin the US have been bred over and over so much, that physically and \nmentally, it amounts to about six individual pugs. The reason why certain \nbreeds are prone to certain types of health issues is because of breeding. \nUltimately, breeders want that money, so they're going to leave all the \npesky facts out.

That, \nplus the fact that it's also relatively common for breeders to breed two \ndogs that are close in lineage for optimum results. For dogs this doesn't \nresult in visual gene alteration like it does in some species, but it can \noften lead to health problems, higher mortality and increased \nagression/mental instability (I usually wasn't allowed to go around dogs \nthat my dad bought due to this fact). Finally, it gets a bad rap because \nanimal shelters are filled to the brink with animals that end up euthanized \nbecause people would rather get a dog for the name labelling more than \nanything.\n\nTL;DR: just like with anything else in the world, you have to check all the \nstops before going with a breeder. There's nothing necessarily wrong with \nwanting a dog of a specific breed (especially if you need a hypoallergenic \ndog) but it's best to educate yourself first.",
