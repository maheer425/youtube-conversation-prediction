It how is was meant to be pronounced. However \nas with many things the English speaking community has mispronounced it for \nso long that it has become the common English way of saying it. Much like \nselfie is now an actual word. \n\nAlso it originally stems from old Greek and Roman mythology were it would \nsound more like this :http://www.pronouncenames.com/search?name=Cerberus  \n\nhttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Kerberos \n\nAlso since we are talking about the actual mythological creature and not \nsome english rip-off slang.

Dante's pilgrim pride is just a whack emcee without his \nguide. But why call in the pagan squadrons of bards from Limbo's secret \ngarden in the midst of a benediction of Christian metaphysics? Terza rima \ndidn't just rhyme for the cynics, it wasn't just political business, and \nthere's also the problem of our unreliable witness. So check it: the Aeneid \ndeals with the aftermath of the Trojan war & sh*t. Ostensibly, it's an \nhistorical justification of the Roman Empire, commissioned by Octavian \nAugustus after he seized the regime; Virgil's own stance on the legitimacy \nof both Octavian's empire and Empire as such is just out on the block, but \nthat cold emcee shoots the trees with the breeze by re-branding the Greek \ngods to stand in for his bastard manager's daddy's iffy-lineage, so Julius \nCaesar (and thus Octavian) flex demigod status over any plebe who steps to \nmess with 'em. (Tho on the upside, when you got thugs on the block, weaker \nthugs on the next block think twice about reppin') by tracing their fateful \nfrom Venus , who the Greeks called Aphrodite (or something like it. You \ngotta squeeze The Aeneid like a pimple on the skin of Dante's Inferno with \nat minimum two fingers, man: Dante uses Virgil as a character in his \nInferno to guide the not-so-anonymous pilgrim through Hell; but Virgil, \nsnatched the break-stick from his own predecessor, Homer, depicting the \nmain character, Aeneas, squirming like a worm through the underworld in \nBook VI. So rack 'em. We back to Greek tongues and out of Latin ones when \nthe blind bard depicted Odysseus' communing with the dead to gank the \nscraps of forgotten prophets. Now your best dressed but still stubbly \naddressor personally tends toward a reading of Inferno that reconfigures \nthe reading of both Virgil and the apocalyptic tradition of the prophetic \nbooks of scripture, particularly Ezekiel 2-4, in order to synthesize the \ndiscourse. \"Digest my word,\" says Virgil to his boy-toy Dante in Inferno: \nthe heads who contend to lead the dead with prescient vocal embers will \nremember how Ezekiel's eating of the scroll and the order that he bake his \nbread on a fire of human dung -- we ain't gotta tell you where it's comin' \nfrom, but thread the needle into the sequel. We taste dread vowels \nsandwiched by nouns' bread -- on the reg -- or else it's all in our heads. \n& yes yes y'all. & you don't stop. \n\nHere's a free audio version of John Dryden's translation of Virgil: \nhttps://archive.org/details/aeneid_0810_librivox1, and here's a printable \ntext version of it: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/228.\ufeff",
