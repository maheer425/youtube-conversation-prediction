Do you know how defenseless \na man feels while being hit by a woman? Just as defenseless as a woman \nbeing hit by a man. As much as you literally cannot hit back, we can't hit \nback at all and some girls know how to throw a punch. That's one of the \nmain reasons why I say society treats women like children. What is the only \nother demographic allowed to go around hitting people with no consequences? \nChildren.\n\nAlso, do women have to go die in wars? Even when they're in the military, \nthey aren't really in harm's way. Do women have to clean out the sewers? Do \nwomen have to lift heavy shit all day? Men so obviously do THE HARDEST jobs \non Earth. Therefore, being a man is harder.\n\nBut the #1 reason is...women have infinite numbers of reproductive options. \nMen just have to settle for what they can get. Even an average looking \nwoman can marry decent looking rich guy and live the life. Only the most \nhandsome of men can do that, but they have to marry old, ugly women they \naren't attracted to.\n\nModern feminism is so incredibly destructive.",

They bullied him to tears. Made him cry in public; \nTo submit to the Social Justice Warrior thugs.\n\nFirst they'll start with gender quotas. Then Human Resources (which are \nmostly women), will enforce it and specifically pick more women over male \ncandidates of future employees. (Intentionally ignore males in favour of \nwomen.)\n\nThen they'll turn the place into one social justice warrior zone of taking \noffence to everything you do.\n\nAfter a couple years, you'll find you are walking egg shells.\n\nYou'll eventually hold back in contributions because if you dare make her \n\"feel\" incompetent, she'll turn to HR. All she has to do is make a claim of \nsexual harassment based on how she \"feels\". And you'll be entangled in a \n\"he says, she says\" scenario where you will be punished. (Women support \nwomen. How do you think you can defend yourself if HR and your accuser are \nin alignment with one another? One is more concerned with pushing more \nwomen into positions, regardless of cost, and the other knows she can get \naway with making dishonest accusations.)\n\nPunishment will be some form of \"sensitivity training\". Where you are \nemotionally pressured into admitting you are guilty. (Even if you have done \nnothing)...Little do you know, you are already guilty if you are male. \nEspecially a white male.\n\nOver time, you'll end up miserable and frustrated to the point where you \nquit or leave the field altogether. (Which is exactly what ALL Feminists \nwant. To drive out all males of any areas where society deems of high \nstatus.)\n\n...And when regular women enter that area, they will wonder: \"Where are all \nthe men?\"\n\nHow do I know all this?\n\nI've seen this implemented in Government depts in Australia. Its very \nnotable in the Dept of Public Prosecutions. (Where my sister used to work). \nThere are next to no male legal clerks. They have all been driven out. \nHaven't you noticed Feminists say nothing when there are more women than \nmen in certain areas, despite claiming they are for \"equality\"? Its a total \nlie. Their words and actions don't align.\n\nOn a side note: You wanna know how to make those female legal clerks \nunproductive? Pull the fire alarm in the next building. The females will \nrace over to the window and peek down to oogle over firemen responding to \nthe alarm. (My sister noticed this behaviour over some fire drill in the \nnext building).\n\n\nI was an engineer. I resigned because I found out that my former employer \nwere put in a position where if they don't have more female engineers, they \nwould not get the lucrative Govt contract. This all happened while I was \nsitting on the toilet and overheard two management guys discussing whether \nto promote a woman over me because they needed to fill the quota. They were \nconflicted because I made considerable contributions to the company and led \na good team in past projects.\n\n24 hours later, I resigned. I want no part in a politically correct society \nwho only cares about what is between your legs, the colour of your skin, \netc than competence, skill, and useful contributions that can be made.\n\nI later learned they won the bid to the contract, but fumbled it so bad \nthey lost it to a rival. They were later \"acquired\" (bought out) by one of \nthe bigger companies.\n\n\nBy the way, the only way to defend yourself against a \"he said, she said\" \nscenario is with a camera or smartphone. Something that records voice or \nvideo. Because people tend to behave very differently when they see they \nare being recorded.",
