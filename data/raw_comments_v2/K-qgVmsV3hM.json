I would argue this \nview is supported by the fact that Romeo was in love with someone else at \nthe start of the play, but forgot all about her when he saw Juliet.  Like a \nlot of youngsters, the unhappy couple were more in love with being in love \nthan they were with each other.  Since this foolhardy love is what \nultimately causes their deaths, I think it's fair to say that this play \nfalls perfectly into the tragic genre. \n\nSome might argue that their love should be taken as real because love at \nfirst sight was a common occurrence in stories of that time.  But I would \nargue that Shakespeare was simply ahead of his time, as are all great \nartists.\ufeff",

First, remember they are \n\"star-crossed\" lovers, which doesn't mean they were starry-eyed for each \nother, nor does it mean that they were simply unlucky--it means that the \ngods, the fates, the stars, or whatever deity you choose, has ruled that a \nlove like theirs (lust) is not sanctioned, not healthy, and won't ever work \nout in the long run.  There are many evidences that they were in lust, not \nlove, including Romeo's recent pining for Rosaline, whom he claims to love, \nbut then falls for Juliet on sight.  And let's not forget Juliet's \nshallowness--not really her fault--but consider her training from a ditzy \nmom, a bumbling dad, and a completely rustic and backwards Nurse, who knows \nmore about Juliet's birthday than her own mother!!\n\nBut don't forget all the other things going on in the play.  Juliet was \nalready presumed dead.  She had little to gain by resurrecting--she'd have \na lot of explaining to do (like why she was no longer a virgin, and she \nwould also have to criminally implicate The Friar and The Nurse in the \naiding and abetting of Romeo's escape) and she also would then have to \nmarry Paris (a man she found most repulsive).  So, she had motives other \nthan \"love.\"\n\nRomeo also had motives other than \"love.\"  The Prince had already decreed \nthat it was death to Romeo if he was found in Verona because he murdered \nTybalt, so he was a dead man walking anyway--and he'd also have some \nexplaining to do, which would criminally implicate The Friar, The Nurse and \npossibly Benvolio, not to mention The Apothecary.  \n\nSo, while many modern versions of ROMEO AND JULIET like to make it a \nromance, claiming their two-day teenage fling was some kind of love worthy \nto die for, I say we stick to Shakespeare's text and call it what he called \nit: The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet.",

Besides all that, we are trying to encourage our students to use \nappropriate language in school, public, work settings, etc., vs the \nlanguage they might use while talking to good friends, or socially outside \nof school.
