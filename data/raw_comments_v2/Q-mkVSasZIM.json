History comes from \"historia\" (story in Ancient \nGreek) so the embellishments, religious angles were all a part of it. \nThat's awful reporting by modern standards but it's ignorant to compare \nthem as if they are the same thing. 2,000 odd years makes a huge difference.\nbtw, Aristophane's Frogs is absolutely hilarious.

Sure the Athenians beat them \nback at Marathon, but I am not even sure if the second invasion was even \nmeant to conquer. It just seemed that Persia wanted to punish Athens. What \nabout when the Greeks tried to pull the same shit on Persia when they \ninvaded Egypt before Alexander the Great, and the Greeks got their asses \nPersian? Or how Sparta needed Persia to sponsor them so they could conduct \ntheir wars? If people want to bring up Alexander the Great, remember that \nhe was fighting an empire that was unstable and he considered himself as an \nAchaemenid king. Besides his empire broke after his death and everything \nthe Greeks took from the Persians, the Parthians who are basically Persian, \ntook back. \n\nAlso, when Thomas Jefferson wrote the Constitution about giving people \nrights it was more inspired Cyrus the Great then it was by Athens or Rome. \nSeriously, people need to get their heads and asses out of 300 and give \nAchaemenid Persia some fucking credit. It deserves to go down as one of the \ngreatest empires in history. \ufeff",
