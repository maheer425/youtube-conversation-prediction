            "text": "Hello there, Tyler.\n\nI have been on the internet since I was 7. I started watching YouTube in \nlate 2007 when I was 12. I have watched hundreds of thousands of videos \n(not including rewatches). I used to watch around 8 hours of YouTube a day \nin high school. Out of all the content that I have been exposed to on the \ninternet, I can honestly say that you are one of the most inspirational \ncreators out there. You don't sit behind a mask or a character in order to \nfit into society or what society says or expects you should be. You have an \namazing personality that has a perfect blend of empathy and confidence \nwithout being gullible or prideful. You are not afraid to stand out from \nthe crowd. You go out of your way to let people, complete strangers at \nthat, realize that they are not alone. You make them laugh, think, and \nrelate to not only you, but everyone else that watches you. Your level of \nambition is absolutely astounding, and just the aura that it gives off can \ninspire so many people to be better and to work harder. I feel that someone \ncould get to know you like friend simply by watching your videos. This is \nextremely rare nowadays, and I never stumble upon people so true to \nthemselves anymore.\n\nThat's enough ass kissing for one paragraph. \n\nI should stop being so impersonal and explain who I am. My name is Dylan. I \nam 20 years old, and I live in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. I have been \nthrough a lot of things through my life that have shaped me into who I am. \nFrom being bullied, to living with split custody at a very young age, I \nhave been through some shit. Something that I feel has shaped me the most, \nhowever, is a condition that I was diagnosed with since I was six. I have \nADHD.\n\nThis brings me to why I decided to write this comment.\n\nAs someone with ADHD, I can tell you that it is difficult to motivate me to \ndo something that I do not want to do. I like to call ADHD the \"give a \nfuck\" condition because it is really easy to tell if you care at all about \nwhat is being presented to you. If you don't care, you simply cannot pay \nattention to it. If you do care, you can't find enough time in the day to \nbe interested in it.\n\nThis was highly apparent in my high school years when I could not focus on \nimportant classes. It came to a point when I was so helpless to my \ncondition that I couldn't get my grades to go up no matter how hard I \ntried. I fell into depression from the sheer pressure to succeed. I stopped \ntalking to my parents and hanging out with my friends. I became extremely \nanxious and would spend hours in my room staring at a wall, wondering how \nmiserable my life would be without a good education. I attempted suicide a \nfew times, but thankfully never went through with it. \n\nThe last time I tried to off myself was when I realized why I was \nmiserable. I was so focused on making other people happy with my \naccomplishments that I never considered my own happiness into the equation. \nI realized that nobody could help me fix this problem. I had to fix this \nproblem alone. I decided to stop caring so much about impressing everyone \nelse and started to try to impress myself. From that day on, I would strive \nto do better than I thought I was capable of, no matter what the subject \nmay be. THAT would be my motivation.\n\nI am now the first in my family on both sides to get into college, \nsomewhere no one thought I would get to. Somewhere *I* never thought I \nwould get to. Somewhere they *told* me I would never get to.\n\nSometimes you just have to find the right motivation to bring out a drive \nthat you didn't know you had. It took me a bit longer than most people, but \nI eventually found it through the darkness and the pain. I never want \nanyone around me to have to find motivation like that, and that is why I \nlove your videos.\n\nYou have accomplished so much in your life, Tyler. You have used your power \nto inspire most, if not all of your fans to be better simply by being you. \nThey don't have to go through the hell that I did to find a drive. You have \nhelped people in ways that you can't even imagine.\n\nKeep on slaying, Tyler.\ufeff",
