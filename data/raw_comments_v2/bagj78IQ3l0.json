AND AFDODKFJOAK ITS \nAMAZING. THEIR NEW COMEBACK IS so awesome <3\n\ni.... to be honest... i like like a ton of different groups..... exo got me \ninto kpop, really. and u dont say, i was obsessed with them for like a \nwhole year until i discovered other groups. haha... ya im fickle. and thats \nnot good. sigh. i need to fix my bad habits XD\n\nthese are some really talented gruops u should check out if u havent yet: \nexo, bts, big bang, b.a.p., b1a4, high4, nell, ft island (i am currently \nobsessed with them right now), winner, and soon to be coming ikon, and many \nmany more. im betting that i forgot a few of my fav bands, but i will add \non as i remember. infinite is also pretty darn awesome. <3 okay this is \nlike story of my kpop life and ya its so long..................... bai!\ufeff",
