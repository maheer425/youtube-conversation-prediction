The strong force is even 100 times stronger than \nthe electromagnetic force and pulls the protons and neutrons together. It \nalso affects neutrons, because the strong force, other than the electro \nmagnetic force, is independent of the charge. It only matters that neutrons \nare hadrons just like protons.

I dare you.... \nconsidering the Universe if what.. multi billions of light years across (If \nI recall correctly it was 13.8 billions light years across)... and a single \nsecond at light speed can circumference the earth.... 7 times. \n\nHow much is a billion? Well... here... if you counted every second... it \nwould take you 31 years... yes 31 years to count to just 1 billion...\n\nMind = Melted\n\nSo... coming back to that grapefruit example.... Let assume the blue berry \nwas a planck meter.... that universe would be an atom.... and then... yikes.\n\nAnd hey that not even going as indepth as later on the video when comparing \nprotons.. You still can get much smaller then that without even going to \nplanck, there are also things like quarks and so on. Much smaller then the \nmassive atom.\n\nAdmittedly I never knew about just how dense these nuclueses are. That is \nvery interesting!\n\nThe Universe is a very odd place indeed.\ufeff",

It is an \nundeniable consequence of quantum theory, it arises from exactly the same \nprinciples that create the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle.

As far as I know, there has never been a single prediction by it \nthat was proven wrong. Now I'm not pretending that there are no mysteries \nin quantum theory, far from it, it's just that all those mysteries are \nabout the causes of quantum phenomena, not their existence (so basically, \nit's definitely true, it works every time, but we don't know why).
