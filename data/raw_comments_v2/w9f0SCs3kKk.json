Ji Hyo has HUGE follower \nespecially due to the success of Running man (my bias there is Yoo Jae \nSeok) and its good that Navi songs get to be promoted here.

It's \nonly granted that there is a barrier between what YOU know about korean \naesthetics compared what koreans know. You said you've done some research \nabout these topics, correct? Then tell me- what do you mean by korean \nbeauty standards anyways? Double eyelids? Chubby cheeks? High nose? As a \nKorean myself, those are conventional expectations that some (not all) of \nus have towards our female celebrities. Haha, how ironic: Jihyo seems to \nhave all of these features and an interestingly charming personality, which \nis a bonus. The \"top layer\" of korean actresses that you mentioned excludes \njihyo. haha, in what world? Go to naver, korea's #1 search/news/media site \nand type '\uc1a1,' which is the first part of her stage name. if you did your \n\"research\" you will see that she ranks higher than song joong ki and song \nhye kyo. True, running man has definitely boosted her popularity but aren't \ncelebrities these days defined by their popularity rather than their \ntalent? That's why we use descriptions such as \"underrated\" and \n\"under-appreciated\" towards a few stars.\n\nIf you're really being \"objective,\" you wouldn't rank people in terms of \nhow they look, because everybody has their own opinions on beauty. However, \nif you really want to discuss beauty in an evenhanded manner, i have no \nproblem in discussing facial proportions, symmetries, and beauty ratios \nwith you. ",
