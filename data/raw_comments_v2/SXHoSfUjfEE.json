He was just an human being who lived in desert and \nsuccessfully spread his religious views in a form of a codified religion \nall over the world. It shows that how it is easy to brainwash large \nsections of human beings including the intelligent ones. Even intelligent \nmen and women do not want to think of out of the box. They want to stay \nwithin the safety net of their tribe and do not want to isolate/expose \nthemselves as weak/vulnerable. An ordinary man like Mohammed turned into a \ndemi-god in hearsay book like Quran. This explains that why there are many \ntraumas and human sufferings all around the world. That explains that why \nlarge majority of people just stand there like mute spectators but do not \ndo something to help someone in need/trouble. That explains holocaust, \nApartheid, Class-room bullying and workplace harassments. Many of us are \n'alone' and could not find companion and lover out of 7 billion human \npopulation. Our 'proposal of love' are 'cruelly' rejected by 'beautiful' \nmen and women like we have committed 'crime of the century' against them. \nNeed for dominance, brutal fighting for control of resources, tribal \nmindset is part of our psyche. Many young bright teenage boys and girls run \naway from their homes to join criminals gangs like ISIS who publicly behead \npeople, rape women and children. Something is seriously wrong within us \nhuman beings. We remain in 'denial mode' to feel better about ourselves.",

But i think its also a smart move for a population to compare \nitself to the wealthy minorities living among them because that creates \nmore drive to be just as wealthy or even more, thus enriching the country, \nwhich is one of the reasons why America is the Wealthiest country in the \nworld, i mean its no surprise that the entire america was created by \nimmigrants and thus is the world's most powerful country, it attracts rich \nminorities from other countries to power the economy and then over time the \ngeneral population catches up to this minorities wealth status, except for \nthe Mexican immigration off coarse, which does more harm than good to \nAmerica.",

Duh, of course they are going to be. \n Because you are looking at a specialized representation of Americans in \nthese other countries.  You don't compare a specialized emigre' population \nto the average joe in host country.  You compare them to the average joe in \nhome country.  What you find is that there are far more unsuccessful, \nuneducated Indians per capita than there are Americans.   \ufeff",
