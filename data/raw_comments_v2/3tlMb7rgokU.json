We did not know there was a rule \nthat you have to ask for the animal to be administered anesthesia for the \nsurgery, but they will not tell you that you must do this, you're suppose \nto just know.  So, when we took our cat in to be fixed, they neutered him \nwithout any form of anesthesia and thus caused him to develop a fear of a \nhand going anywhere near his belly.  He was fine with his belly being \nrubbed before the surgery, but after he would never let anyone near it.  \nSo, make sure you check with your vet before you get your pets spayed or \nneutered.\ufeff",
