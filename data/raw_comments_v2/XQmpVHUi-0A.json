Also sings really well and is known to cause eargasms \nwith his\nvoice and lyrics. See further 'Trouble', 'Look Here' and 'Expensive \nGirl' Jin(The Pink Princess/Eomma Jin)- loves pink, is the group's mother, \nis the visual\nand considered the best looking, is a vocal liner (singer), is famous for \nhis\nshoulders, cooks to more or less chef standards and is good at the traffic\nlight dance and the dislocated shoulder dance. Caused severe eargasms in\n'Trouble'. \nYoongi (#Swagmeister)- rapper line, writes a lot of his own\nraps/lyrics and general songs for the group both on his own and with other\nmembers, is the grampa of the group, you do not ever disturb his sleep (gf\ntravel neck pillow) can also sing and when really actively involved in \nBangtan\nBombs (search this they are great to get to know them) is great fun to \nwatch. \nHobie(sweet and caring J-Horse)- dancer line but is a triple threat (sings, \ndances\nand raps), is known for his girl group dances with a particular obsession \nfor\n'Touch My Body' by Sistar. does cute concept stuff best in my opinion with\nespecially cute noises, has a memorable 'dancing face', is the most caring\narguably in the group and was nick named J-Horse because of the slightly \nlong\nface. Particularly known touchy-feely person who loves skinship with the\nothers- particularly Jimin and Tae. \nJimin (The Body/Sweet Boy)- dancer line but\nalso sings (he does all the falsettos usually), has the best loved \nbutt/thighs\nand over all body though insists Jin's is better. Is known for his sweet\ndisposition never getting angry for long and forgiving Kookie for not \ncalling\nhim 'Hyung' which shows his older age and is tradition/denotes respect and\ntherefore without is disrespectful. \nTae (4D Alien)- vocal line, has a problem\nkeeping his tongue in his mouth and has killer hip movements, is known for\nbeing a seriously outside the box thinker with the members considering him \nan\nalien (lovingly not in a bad way), is generally really innocent aside from\ntongue/hip thing, loves acting and wants to be in a movie or something. Fans\nconsider him the love child of Daehyun from BAP and Baekhyun from EXO who \nare\nalso aliens and look very like him.\nKookie (the golden maknae)- is the baby of the group at 17 (18 in \nSeptember) which is why he is called the maknae, does everything really \nwell (dances/sings/raps/beat boxes/girl group dance leader...)\nI could go on. School wise though if it's not music, art or p.e. he dislikes\nit. Is perhaps the sexiest when he tries to be which is bad news for noonas\n(older women) like me (I'm 22). \nHope this helps to get you started. Also good idea to watch their shows \n'Rookie King' and 'American Hustle Life' as well as their'Bangtan Bombs' \nand interviews like on 'Weekly Idol and 'Beatles Code'.",
