WHAT SO \nEVER.\n\nI'm just gonna rant about it:\nThe first chapter was so dull that the only word that caught my attention \nwas horse. Then I realized the horse wasn't given a name. So I hated the \ncharacter. Who isn't identified until the fifth chapter. The story line \ngoes about as slow as a snail, moving about 1 hour per chapter. Also, \nthere's grammatical errors, for it switches from past tense, to present \ntense, to future tense. It's very confusing. So I will not be reading it \nand will pick up An Abundance of Katherines instead because it's actually a \ngood book. \ufeff",
