I think you know you're \nmisrepresenting the information on that, though.\nSecondly, although many corporations do in fact get tax provisions and \ncredits from the $1.08 Trillion our government dishes out annually, it is \nthe middle class and poor who receive most of our tax credits. Here is our \neffective tax rates by bracket:\n\nLowest quintile: -4.5%\nSecond quintile: -1.0%\nMiddle quintile: 3.7%\nFourth quintile: 6.2%\nTop 1%: 24.6\n\n(Congressional Budget Office)\nAs you can see, the poorest Americans actually get more back in tax credits \nthan they paid into through their income. Do I smell wealth redistribution? \n(Note: this is the premise of my argument of which you have yet to address).\n\nSecondly, you seem to have a naive understanding of corporate taxes. \nAlthough the average Effective Corporate Income Tax has dropped to roughly \naround 20%, corporations are still being bombarded with other taxes, \nproperty taxes, sales taxes, etc. The rate you need to look for is the \nMarginal Effective Tax Rate on corporate investment which includes sales, \nproperty, and income. This rate is currently averaged at 35.3%, the highest \nof any country in the OECD.\n\nhttp://taxfoundation.org/article/us-corporate-effective-tax-rate-myth-and-fact \nOECD: \nhttp://www.oecd.org/about/membersandpartners/list-oecd-member-countries.htm\n\n\"2014 US MILITARY BUDGET $640 BILLION\"\n\nNo problem with that. I support federal spending when it is going to create \nhigh-skill labor, especially when it is something that cannot (and SHOULD \nnot) be provided privately. The hundreds of billions we spend on \nunemployment insurance and foodstamps, which eventually ends up at Walmart \nto create LOW-skill labor, is a different story. I'm curious, what is your \nstance on education? Do you believe an education is necessary to get a \ndecent job that can support a family? Or do you believe a job that anyone \ncan do should be able to support a family? Of course, I don't really expect \na clear-cut answer of this question, but you're free to entertain me if you \nwish.\n\nKeep in mind that I did not support the bank bailouts during the 2008 \ncrash. You call my facts \n\"Lowinformation/Republican/Corporatist/Millionaire/Apologist bullshit\" Well \nwhy don't you look at the 2008 bailout and check how many Democrats \napproved it and compare it to how many Republicans approved it.\n\nI am a capitalist, not a corporatist.

We spend more on \ndefense than all developed countries combined.\nDirect federal subsidies to corporations: The Cato Institute estimates that \nfederal subsidies to corporations cost taxpayers almost $100 billion every \nyear.\nFederal tax breaks for corporations: The tax code gives corporations \nspecial tax breaks that have reduced what is supposed to be a 35-percent \ntax rate to an actual tax rate of 13 percent, saving these corporations an \nadditional $200 billion annually,according to the U.S. Government \nAccountability Office.\nSubsidies to the fast food industry: Research by the University of Illinois \nand UC Berkeley documents that taxpayers pay about $243 billion each year \nin indirect subsidies to the fast food industry because they pay wages so \nlow that taxpayers must put up $243 billion to pay for public benefits for \ntheir workers.\nAdd it up, Corporate welfare costs us at least $543 billion every year. \nMany of these same multinational corporations getting corporate welfare \nalso outsource good paying American jobs 2 China, Korea, India, etc. Poor \nbastards. \nCompany ($-millions) 08-12 Profit 08-12 Tax 08-12 Rate\nGeneral Electric         27,518        \u20133,054      \u201311.1%\nhttp://www.ctj.org/corporatetaxdodgers/sorrystateofcorptaxes.pdf\nThen we have the corporate taxdodgers like GE earning massive $$$, paying \nno tax, + getting a fat fucking tax REFUND on top of it!

The \nAtlantic Monthly estimates that $7.6 trillion was made available by the \nFederal Reserve to banks, financial firms and investors.\nSo, while ppl like u posted their Corporate/Millionaire apologist garbage \nall over the web, The Fed doled out $7.6 trillion to the poor banksters. \nFUN FACTS: The $7.6 trillion was used 2 give bonuses, salaries, etc, 2 the \nsame crooks that caused the huge 2008 meltdown. Guess how many banksters \nwere fined, fired, prosecuted, or jailed 4 causing the crash. ZERO!!! \nWhy??? Because thanks to massive deregulation, every fucking thing the \nbanksters did was perfectly legal!! Dude, it should b obscenely obvious why \nthis shit happened + will continue 2 happen. Our Federal Government, \nRepublicans + Democrats, have been purchased by the 'poor' multinational \ncorporations, Koch brothers, etc.!!\n\n*RECLAIM OUR DEMOCRACY!

I do agree with your original statement though. \n100%. Were (by in large most of) them reckless with subprime mortgages, \nfractional reserve banking,  high risk lending, and pushing \nadjustable-rates on people when they had to know what was about to happen? \n *Yes* they did. However, your analogy with the hooker's good, but it's \nmore like having an NFL game with no refs or a trial with judge. Of course \nthere's going to be chaos. A lineman's job is to protect his QB, an \nattorney's job is to advocate for his client. If nobody's watching the \nlineman's gonna rip his man's facemask off and the lawyer's going to \nfabricate all kinds of evidence, badger/lead every witness and misinform \nthe jury as to the requirements for a verdict.  An IB's job is to generate \ncapital, which is fairly easy to do if *nobody's* watching. If we're gonna \nget into the finger pointing, there are 3 parties involved that all share \n*some* of the blame. The banks, the consumers (nobody wants to hear that \nbut it's true. It wasn't a Madoff situation, where we just flat out got \nripped off. We made bad investments, we were encouraged to do so, but \nstill.... We didn't have to give them our money. This is why I believe Econ \n& finance should be a bigger part of the *mandatory* curriculum at the high \nschool and college levels. We *make* kids read and analyze Hawthorne \n& Dostoyevsky (don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of russian lit, but for \nmaybe 98% of those kids that means *nothing* to them. Just a mandatory \nEnglish class... At the same time most majors at most schools don't even \nhave 1 econ req. Or if they do it's macro 101, basic, and more theory \nthan practice... Anyway). Anyway, point being a fully educated consumer \npaying attention to what was going on in 05-07, should've been able to read \nthe tea leaves and get their affairs in order. But if I could only point \none finger at one party, I'd choose the SEC, and I'd choose the middle \nfinger. They were the allegorical \"missing refs/judges\". I mean  the FCIC \nreport, in a nutshell, said \"The SEC doesn't do a damn thing. Really ever. \nThey're MIA and more than likely corrupt\". Fuckin Eliott Spitzer, alone, \ndid more to stop the bleeding than the entire SEC, and he was just a \ngovernor. Then *he* got caught with a hooker, and *he* was accused of \ncorruption. It took them a decade to catch Madoff for ripping off tens of \nbillions, but Spitzer's got a hooker, and that gets done in a week? No \ndoubt in my mind that investigation was sponsored by Fannie Mae. The SEC is \na joke. If anything they do more harm than good.",
