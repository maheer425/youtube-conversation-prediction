YOUR definition is still exactly the manner in \nwhich I used it.\nYou're right, 1+1 does not imply 2 because 1+1=2 is not an implication, \nit's an equality.\nAn implication would be something like 1+1=2 IMPLIES 2-1=1. Given the rules \nof the group of the integers under addition, we can deduce that 1+1=2 \n\"strongly suggest[s] the truth\" of 2-1=1 even though 2-1=1 is \"not \nexpressly stated\".\nImplication, even in the colloquial sense is not a wishy-washy, vague \nsuggestion. It's a strong suggestion in the lack of an express statement to \na claim's validity. It is a \"strong suggestion\" and the mathematical \ndefinition is only slightly stricter.\nAs to the assumption that I looked at a picture and just couldn't fathom \nhow those two poles could become one: some of my friends did a topology \ncourse this semester (a course which I will be undergoing in second \nsemester too) and I had discussed the hairy ball theorem and simply \nmis-remembered the statement of the theorem.\nAlso, why in the hell would you think that when I'm asking a question as to \nthe nature of a theorem, that I would use anything other than the rigid, \nmathematical definition of the word \"implies\"?? And then when I said \"chain \nof implication\" you didn't pick up on the fact that the rigid definition is \nwhat I meant?\nAlso for someone who seems to have wanted to formally and rigidly lay out a \nseries of statements, you seem to have neglected that the phrase \"two \npoints on a sphere\" is not a claim and has no true or false value. Maybe \nwhat you meant to say was \"a continuous vector field tangent to a sphere \nmust have two points at which the field is equal to zero\". That's a claim. \nThat can have a true or false answer (namely: false). But when you \nconstruct a formal argument with two explicitly contradictory statements \nfor the sole purpose of gloating over a point, you don't sound like a \ngenius, you sound like and asshole.",

My schtick is this: if there is only one hair... no problemo. \nBend it down and it's fine. If there are 10 hairs on a relatively large \nball, they should all go down just like the one did. Does the length of \nhairs even come into play? (and if not, why even make the analogy of a \nhairy ball?) How far does the analogy go? I'm guessing it has to do with \ngoing to infinity # of hairs given the context, but why can't countless \namounts of hairs be gelled down just like all the other hairs? I don't get \nit. Gel can solve all of that, right? \ufeff",
