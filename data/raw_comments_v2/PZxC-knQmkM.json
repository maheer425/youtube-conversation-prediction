The F1 car has a \npower to weight-ratio that is grater than 1. That is absolutely enormous. \nAnd the F1 car, especially the ones from the period, have aerodynamics that \nproduces downforce, and grip, at higher speeds. This means a F1-car does \nnot have the grip you need, until you drive it really fast. Have you seen \nthe video of Richard Hammond trying to drive the Renault F1? It pretty much \nsums it up right there. Also, I've had the opportunity to drive a F1-car \nmyself. Takuma Sato's car from 2002 to be precise. It was a gift on my 30th \nbirthday from all my friends. And I can tell you, trying to handle a car \nlike that is like trying to handle a rollercoaster... :) Oh, and by the \nway, nobody on youtube ever believe me when I say I've driven a F1-car, so \ncheck out this:\n\nrajamakiracing.com\n\nIf you get the chance to do something like this...take it.",
