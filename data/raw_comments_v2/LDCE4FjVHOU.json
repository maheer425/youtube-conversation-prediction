What it has gone on to become isn't too bad either, \nbut the end of the group B days were a very sad slide back into mediocrity. \nWe'd gone from 30 or 40 years of having somewhat tuned up road cars, ending \nwith rather wonderful little rear drivers like the Escort and the Datto \n1600, to ...sudden overnight balls out insanity. It suddenly went from 40 \nyears of gradually improving water pistols, to real 9mm race specials, \nLazar sights and all. Forget paint guns, this was AK-47s at arms length. \nYou just stood, awestruck, like all those dopey fans on stage, who really \ndidn't seem to care if they got killed, as long as you could see Rohl or \nVatenin or somebody go past like an F1 car. And they sounded as wicked as \nthey were, perhaps none more than the 5 cyl Audi Quatros, which sounded \nnothing in the world like a roadgoing Audi, they sounded like the 4 \nhorsemen of the Apocalypse, set to Wagner, played at 11/10 over the full \nLed Zeppelin PA system. If that noise didn't get your blood to zing, then \npetrol flowed in some funny places, but not through your veins, you poor \nsad little child... The hippies drool on about the summer of love, and \nflower power. Petrol heads drool on about group B. We have a reason. There \nwas never anything like it before, and there never will be again. It was \neverything you've ever heard about '80s excess and cocaine high, all in one \ncrazy season. All the Spandex and speed, all the un-complicated sex and \nvery complicated drivelines, all concentrated like one BIG line on a \nmirror. It was amazing, and it will never be like that again. ... then, we \nwent back to water pistols...\ufeff",

This has always been their goal. Its not like they TRIED \nto make quality and failed to do so. Quality and tech costs money. Money \nthat they previously werent willing to spend and money that they currently \ndont have.\n\nAmerican car industry was always about the patriotism and the hype. The \nCOMPLETE lack of independant US car magazines and the fact that they are \nthe only country in the world without critical, factual car shows on TV, \nmeans they mistake any corporate hype, any media stunt performed by the \nbig-3 gets accepted as truth.\n\nIm SO tired of having flags waved in my face in every vaguelly MURCA \nrelated topic.

GM abandoned 89 major \nplants all across the US, cashed in their bailout billions and \nsinglehandedly bankrupted an entire state when they essentially fled the \ncountry, moding the backbone of US manufacturing to China and Korea. Today \n70% of GM is asian.\n\nNo... Not American cars built in Asia... Gm today makes most their money \nselling rebadged Korean Daewoo to China. Bought and paid for by bailout \nbillions that were set aside to secure the future for US / Canadian car \nindustry. So how the HELL is this not a complete and utter failure.\n\nHow could they POSSIBLY have run themselves further into the ground.

These ridiculously \nmisleading lap times were originally set by GM and Chrysler in 2008 smack \nin the middle of their own bankruptcy. When Obama pulled the big3 infront \nof congress and asked them how they were able to go so incredibly bankrupt \nin a market that sells 11-12 million cars a year,\n\nThey were told to prove themselves \"internationally competitive\" to deserve \nObamas hundreds of billions in bailouts... \n\nSo off they went... To the Nurburgring to set spectacularly misleading lap \ntimes with full factory race crews and cars as \"stock\" as Lance Armstrong \nat Tour`d France.\n\nComing home emptyhanded... With hundreds of billions of dollars at stake, \njust wasnt an option.\n\nSo... These are MEDIA STUNTS. Performed with modded cars with rollcages, \nstripped out interiors on LeMans racing tyres with full factory backed race \ncrews.\n\nThen they return to the all-too-willing GM sponsored american motoring \npress with stories of how they went to the Nurburgring, Europes own \nbenchmark, and killed, raped, smoked, owned, destroyed, every supercar on \nthe planet...\n\nWell... Who else DOES this? Except Nissan and now the americans? So who are \nthey claiming to \"beat\" ? This idea of the Ring as some kind of \ninternational benchmark where we all go to see whats \"best\" is an all \namerican myth created to give these misleading american runs some \ncredibility. And now many others have jumped on the trend. Especially those \nwho target the US market where people have such faith in this.\n\nSo now... In ANY car related topic, we have to hear how cheaply built \namerican steel and plastic \"beats\" every supercar on the planet. I \nwonder... How likely is this really. And where is the evidence. But \namericans dont need no evidence. They never question any claim aslong as it \nsupports an entirely one-sided american superiority.\n\nBoth Corvette and Viper claiming fastest production cars when none of them \never were... For the Cadillac, they simply INVENTED a 4 door salooncar \nrecord and claimed it on the spot. At what time does it ever get \nembarrassing? This may go down well in the US where nobody ever looks stuff \nup but please... Dont push these stunts on me.\n\nAnd... To say you would prefer a z28 over a Ferrari 458 is to say you \nreally prefer a lump of coal to a diamond. Nobody would ever say that \nunless you were spoonfed patriotism from childhood. American musclecars \ndont offer modern tech because they cant afford it... Not because old and \ncheap is better than new and expensive.\n\nAnd finally... The Viper... Is possibly the worst sportscar to ever roll \nout of a proper factory. Its the single most crashed sportscar in history. \nGo to Wreckedexotics. com and look up Vipers. There are 23 pages with over \n700 pictures. Thats like 1 in 30 Vipers ever built, crashed on ONE webpage.\n\nSo forgive me but.... How the hell is this \"internationally competitive\"",

It remains to be seen if GM will launch the Corvette C7 in \nEurope. But now that they made the decision to pull Chevrolet / GM out of \nEurope, they MIGHT try to relaunch Cadillac and Corvette as seperate brands \nbut youknow... I doubt it.\n\nIf THIS is what you mean by \"internationally competitive\" then its worse \nthan I thought.\n\nThe Viper.... Was never sold outside the US and havent seen a year of \nprofit from its unveiling in 1989 til its bankruptcy in 2009. Thats 20 \nstraight years of loss. The new one is a whole new beast under Fiat \nleadership. But even that one will never be sold in Europe. You simply \ncannot get away with a 8 and a half liter 10 mpg musclecar here. ",
