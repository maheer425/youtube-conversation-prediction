She will never be released as \nshe will only survive a few days. She is now living in the 30 hectares \ncamp, and staying at night in our gardens with our dogs, her best and only \nfriends. She did not break her hip as in the video, unfortunately the wrong \ninfo was used because this video was not approved directly by us as it was \nsupposed to. No cheetah would ever like to walk on a leash, and footage \nfrom this original video was taken for educational purposes, and not to be \nmade fun of! We are responsible conservationist and will never allow any \nform of hunting or trading with our animals, they are meant for more, to be \nreleased back into the wild, where they belong. If Yakira was born in the \nwild, she wouldve been dead within a few days due to her injury, which is a \nbroken front shoulder and elbow.... not a hip! Feel free to see more of her \non her own new facebook page, https://www.facebook.com/cheetahyakira?ref=hl \nand learn more about our breeding and re-wilding program \nhttps://www.facebook.com/kwacheetah?ref=hl where you will be educated on \nthe plight of the endangered Cheetah. And yes, unfortunately there are real \nbad people out there exploiting animals for financial gain.\ufeff",

Even though females are smaller 46 pounds siding on 5 ounces \nis going to cause injury.\n\nIt takes months of healing and therapy to fix a humans broken hip so they \ncan resume a near normal life. A baby animal that has to be bottle feed and \nhand raised can't go back to a normal life. She may not have the speed a \ncheetah needs to hunt her proper prey properly. \n\nIf you listened carefully and read the description you should see that the \npeople she lives with run a CONSERVATION facility, where the aim is to \nrelease the young animals into the wild and increase the numbers of an \nendangered species living in their real habitat. This is what's being done \nwith many species all over the world.\n\nI share your outrage over the very concept of canned and trophy hunts.
