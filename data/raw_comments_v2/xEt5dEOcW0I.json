            "text": "Its sad that this is from a comedy movie in 1989 and here it is 2014 and \nthis is a serious and unnervingly large issue that is being dealt with \nbetween parents and teachers today, at least in the area I live in. Its sad \nand pathetic and I think teachers and staff who think like this woman \nshouldn't have a job. Unfortunately the demand for teachers is too high \nespecially for all the BS they have to go through so our kids get to deal \nwith people like this. I refuse to shove pills down my kids throats or sent \nthem to some \"specialist\" doctor or therapist because their being a damn \nkid.\ufeff",
