I know for a \nfact that the lion is the more dangerous fighter.its literally what they \nare made to do. tigers are effective solitary hunters. lions are effective \nbrawlers they need to be in order to take over a pride.  tigers could do \nnothing to them in a serious battle .tiger hits lion , lion says is that as \nhard as u can hit? why don't you hit me again pussy <lol. anyway cats are \nalways in the alpha brain wave witch means they are always trying to \ndominate each other. this is why I believe the larger one shows restraint \nas he knows its the kittens nature to try to dominate him. the little one \nis the asshole 100% hes invading the older cats territory and attacks him \nwith little to no respect. I understand not wanting the neighborhood cats \nripping each other apart I always stop the battles myself. I don't want my \nkitty looking like scar from the lion king. my point is that if the \nolder one was the mean one he would finish him. he would hunt him down and \nkill him without as much as shaking a paw afterward because its perfectly \nwithin his capability. not even its owner could stop him believe me. once a \ncat sets its mind to something its do or die . the fact that he doesn't and \nis tolerant of being hunted by that little brat is a beautiful thing\ufeff",
