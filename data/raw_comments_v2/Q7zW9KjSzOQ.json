Literally how \nmuch one side of your face looks like the other side. The more both sides \nare equal, the healthier, therefore the more attractive that face is \nconsidered. \n\nLooking at the average person closely you'll see that their eyes may be \nslightly different sizes or not perfectly aligned, their cheeks may not be \nthe same size or in the same place. It sounds bizarre, but its perfectly \nnormal. It is people with near perfect symmetry that are unusual. That is \nwhy they're seen as more attractive than the normal person.\n\nFor instance, Tom Cruise has a very symmetrical face, in fact many celebs \ndo, and of course models.\n\nGenerally regardless of race or ethnicity, health, symmetry and a \nparticular ratio as far as feature placement are what really determine \ngeneral \"attractiveness\".",

All four of them have an \nincredibly similar facial structure: small but defined chin and jaw, thick \nlips, high cheek bones, thin cheeks, large upturned eyes, minimal brow \nbone, medium-large forehead, medium-small sized nose*, etc. Not to mention \nthe perfect skin, large straight white teeth, etc. As far as body structure \ngoes, they all share long necks, narrow/slim shoulders (Lupita's are \npushing it), long legs, and dramatically fit one of the three socially \nacceptable body types (athletic, thin, or curvy). Men also have a very \nclear beauty standard in American pop culture.\n\n*The only real difference between the kind of popular beauty standards \nAmerica has compared to Korea is that our racial diversity forces us to \nhave a little more respect and leniency for other races and may turn a \nblind eye when a black woman has a slightly larger nose, or a Caucasian has \nthinner lips, or an Asian has wider cheeks bones, etc.\n\nI do understand what you're trying to say, though. America has people of so \nmany different races in pop culture that it creates an illusion of there \nbeing less strict of a mold as far as beauty standards go, and Americans \nare obviously much less gung-ho about getting surgery to fit it. People \naren't quite as open about any obsessions they may have with their \nappearance because vanity is seen in a very negative light beyond the big \ncities. Cosmetic surgery is also frowned upon in many areas of America to \nthe point where you may be treated poorly or assumed to be mentally unwell \nif you go through with it.\n\nThere are a lot of variables that factor into why we haven't fallen quite \nas hard a Korea has with all that nonsense, but the standards themselves \nare definitely there.",
