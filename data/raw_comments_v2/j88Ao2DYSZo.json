Living in houses \nwhere the living room was your bedroom, burning coal for his heat, He \nBought one new car in his life and paid cash. He only had a third grade \neducation and the educated in the family felt that was all he knew. He \nowned a small business of delivering milk door to door, believe it or not. \nHe served as a pastor for free for 30 years. Upon his death the family met \nto settle the estate. Sadly he passed away to cancer. The family was in \ntotal shock when the when they seen his assets. $100,000 cash. Owned the \nchurch building. Owned the property next to his house. Owned the property \nin front of his house. Owned another house 4 miles away. Owned all the \nCommercial trailers with reefers. Owned all the trucks. Owned all the \ninventory. His debt after hospital bills. $0. The point is the 3rd grade \neducated reject was the smart one and the rest of the family were foolish \nfor not listening. Our generation and my kids generation are doomed to \nperpetual poverty because we refuse to listen to the simple minded and \nfollow educated fools. I just lost $150,000 on a piece of property that was \na supposed win win. Kept it 20 years. I have lost $40,000 on my house \nvalue, not counting 14 years of payments If I had of did what he said, \"Buy \na travel trailer and live in that. Save your money and pay cash for a piece \nof land. Move trailer on the land. Then build your house and pay cash as \nyou go.\" I would be a filthy rich man right now. Instead I'm in poverty and \nso is most people I know. Yes they have a lot of stuff. Yes they owe for \nall of it. Yes they all have some sort of sickness. Yes there kids are home \nalone as they slave for stuff. Yes MTV is raising them. Yes...you get the \npicture.\ufeff",
