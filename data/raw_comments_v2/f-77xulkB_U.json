Beheadings, \nschool shootings on a rampant scale, fake bomb threats to get out of class, \nrace wars, rioting, earthquakes and freak weather on a scale never before \nseen, etc. It's crazy out there. And coincidentally, all of these messes \nand problems we see everyday in the news were actually prophecied in \nadvance by Jesus Christ and the Bible over 2000 years ago. It's just one of \nmany proofs that the Bible is divine (coincidentally, no other religious \nbooks predict the future as specifically as the Bible does. The Qur'an made \na few but they're vague and some turned out to be false. The Bible has a \n100% accuracy track record when it comes to prophecy and future events).\n\nThis all means that Christ is about to return, whether you believe it or \nnot. Which is great if you're saved but it'll be hell on earth if you \naren't. You don't want to be left here for the Tribulation period.\n\nMany prophecies will reach fulfillment during the Tribulation period, but \nwe can see right now that all the end time signs foretold by Jesus and His \nprophets have emerged and are converging. Here are some of these signs:\n\n\u00b7         Israel has become a burdensome stone and is at the center of the \nworld\u2019s attention.\n\u00b7         Unrestrained anti-Semitism is forcing more and more Jews to \nreturn to Israel.\n\u00b7         Israel is literally surrounded by enemies who want to destroy the \ntiny nation. \n\u00b7         The nations that will participate in the upcoming wars are \naligned as prophesied in the Bible.\n\u00b7         Everywhere you look ethnic group is against ethnic group.\n\u00b7         Wars and rumors of wars abound on earth.\n\u00b7         Russia has risen, has a hook in its jaw and is allied with Iran.\n\u00b7         There are many false religious movements and false prophets.\n\u00b7         The kings of the east are a threat.\n\u00b7         The Euphrates River can be dried to a trickle due to the Ataturk \nDam, which will prepare the way for the kings of the east.\n\u00b7         There is a move towards global religion, global government, and \nglobal economy.\n\u00b7         Global communication is in, increase in knowledge\n\u00b7         Ability to travel to and fro in all the earth\n\u00b7         Nuclear capability\n\u00b7         Signs in the sky\n\u00b7         Signs in the earth; creation groaning\n\u00b7         Return of diseases previously eradicated and superbugs\n\u00b7         The world is like it was in the days of Noah, corrupt and filled \nwith wickedness.\n\u00b7         Horrible terrorist acts are causing fear in the hearts of people \nworldwide. They're even beheading people here in the U.S.\n \nWhen we combine current events with the fact that ISIS controls 1/3 of \nSyria, and many terrorist organizations have a base in its city of \nDamascus, it appears evident that we will soon see the fulfillment of \nIsaiah 17.\n\nWe're going to see all prophecy be fulfilled soon! People, it's time to \nwake up! You can watch real-world news and see these prophecies coming to a \nhead! The writing is on the wall. The Bible isn't a bunch of fairy stories. \nArcheology, geology, topography and history confirm these people, places, \nand events existed and happened! The Book of Acts alone has over 80+ \nhistorically verified facts. Acts was written by Luke, who is considered as \none of the most credible historians who ever lived. And the fact that \nChrist's words are coming true means He's God! Only God knows and can \nprophecy the future thousands of years in advance.\n\nGiven that prophecy is coming true 100%, did you know the Bible also states \nthat Jesus will soon reign over the earth for 1000 years? We can rest \nassured that the earth is going to stick around. The dangerous weather \nwe're all seeing is actually called birth pangs, not climate change. \nTurbulent, violent weather is a major prophetic indicator. The earth itself \nis screaming at us that Christ is about to return! That's why creation is \nin such an uproar. \n\nI'm telling you the truth: Krishna won't save you. allah's just an \namalgamation of all of islam's different gods rolled into one. And being a \ngood person won't save you (we've all sinned in some capacity in our lives- \nhow many people have you cussed at and belittled by trolling online this \nweek?). \n\nBut guess what? God LOVES you! His love goes beyond anything you could \nunderstand. And He knows every jot of information there is to know about \nyou, the good and the bad. And guess what else? He still loves you... even \nthough you shop-lifted that one time. He loves you even though you get a \nsick thrill out of trolling people or watching pornography. He loves you \neven though you're struggling with heroin. And He doesn't want you to \nsuffer under the idea that you did something that you believe is \nunforgivable. There's no soul too lost nor sin so deep that His love and \nmercy can't reach. He loves you even though you've slandered and hurt \nothers. And He'll forgive anything. For instance, people have burned His \nWord. Yet, He's forgiven them! And He wants to forgive you and help you get \nout of your sinful lifestyle! It doesn't matter if you're black, white, \nasian, or indian. Ethnicity isn't a barrier to Him. You're His child! We're \nALL God's children! And if you'll believe in Christ, accept Him as your \nLord and Savior and repent of your sins, He'll save you! Simple as that. No \nworks or merit-earning required.\n\nDo yourself the biggest favor of your life and take that offer. Why settle \nfor mud pies here on earth when Jesus offers you an eternal feast?\n\nDon't be left behind to endure the Tribulation. Save yourselves now while \nthe Ark doors are still open... because they're about to close. And you do \nnot want to be left here when they finally do close. The judgement of God \nis a terrifying thing and if you think God is unfair for judging sinners, \nneed I remind you that He's given humanity the opportunity to escape His \ncoming judgement for over 2000 years if they would simply believe in Jesus \nand repent. God wouldn't be just if He didn't eventually put a stop to sin \nand evil. His holiness requires that judgment occurs.\n\nWe're talking about the fate of your eternal future here... and eternity is \nan awful long time to be on the wrong side. Don't let satan drag you down \ninto the lake of fire with him. That's his end game. He doesn't care about \nyou. His attitude is, \"If I'm going down, you maggots are going down with \nme!\" He wants to destroy you and as many others as possible. What else can \nexplain the evil you see increasing everywhere on a daily basis? Satan \nknows his time is short and he wants to cause as much damage and ensnare as \nmany souls as possible- yours included. Don't let that monster win your \nsoul! Don't give him the last laugh by your disregarding all of this \nthinking it's nonsense. He'd love nothing more than for you to convince \nyourself that all of this is lunacy... because then your soul is his.\n\nIf you doubt all this, that's fair. But the writing is on the wall every \nday in the news. It's getting harder and harder to deny if you'll just wake \nup and be honest with yourself.\n\nIf you have doubts but deep down you want to be saved, I encourage you to \nseek out the following authors. Ravi Zacharias is great if you have \nquestions about Jesus but you're sensitive to issues of race and foreign \nethnicity. William Lane Craig and Norman L. Geisler are great if you're an \natheist or agnostic who believes that science is the end-all, be-all answer \nto everything. They'll give you answers and evidence to really chew on if \nyou'll be open and honest to what they have to say. And Lee Strobel is \ngreat for those of you who have a cursory interest into whether everything \nabout Jesus and the Bible is true or not.\n\nFor more readily available answers, the \"One Minute Apologist\" here on \nyoutube is great for quick answers to tough questions about God. \n\nIf you're still in doubt about all of this though, take this to heart: the \nBible says Damascus (that's in Syria) will be DESTROYED. A ruinous heap. \nTest God's word against Him! Read Isaiah 17. If Damascus never falls, then \nthe Bible is false. But when Damascus does soon fall... then you'll know \nGod and His Word is no lie.\n\nBesides that, how can an all-knowing, all-seeing, inerrant God get anything \nwrong anyway? If He says Jesus is the only way to heaven, then Jesus really \nis the only way. If there were any other way to heaven, even ONE alternate \nway, then why did Christ have to die? If there's no hell to protect us all \nfrom then His death was pointless. That's why we spread the Gospel: to tell \nyou that there's a way to save yourself. It's a rescue mission! And it's \ncompletely free if you'll simply accept Christ's offer! In any other faith \nyou have to work to secure your salvation. The Bible says our works are as \ndirty rags. None of us could ever produce enough righteous acts to earn our \nway to heaven. That's why Christ's offer is so great: all you have to do is \naccept it and He'll cover you with His righteousness! \n\nSo, you can either harden your heart and refuse His rescue... or better \nyet, you can humbly admit that you're a sinner, turn and repent of your \nsinful lifestyle and believe in Jesus and ask Him to save you. He'd be \ndelighted to. But there's not much time left. Save yourself while you still \ncan.\n\nAlso... support Israel! Israel is facing disgusting anti-semitism. The \nentire world seems to be pressuring them to give up God's land (God \ndeclares it HIS land in the Bible) to their mortal enemies. And the fact \nthat the entire world is pressuring a sovereign country to give up what \nlittle land they have to placate their mortal enemies, is completely insane!\n\nWho do the leaders in the United Nations think they are, anyway? NO other \nnation on this earth would put up with such atrocious and flagrant \ninterference in their business! Why should Israel? The fact that this is \nhappening to Israel, the Apple of God\u2019s eye, which was foretold would \nhappen in scripture, is even more proof that the Bible is 100% accurate.\ufeff",
