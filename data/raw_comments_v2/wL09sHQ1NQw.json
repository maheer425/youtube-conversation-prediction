Because I \ndid not say that twins could not play quadruplets, I simply said because \nthere are 4 that would be quadruplets, because the OP did not state that he \nthought it was twins playing 4 roles, I was covering extra bases due to \ninsufficient content in his comment to be sure of what he intended.\n\nThe first one I said covered the fact there is only one, the second part \ncovered in case he was not a natural English speaker and thought they were \nall individuals. So I was pointing out the term for 4 was quadruplets, \nsimply as a means to inform.\n\nNow if you are too stupid to understand this last reply or you can't pull \nyour head out of your insulting moron rage long enough to comprehend it, \nthen we have nothing more to say and you can go on your merry ignorant way \nof insulting strangers to feel good about yourself like a pathetic little \nweak minded troll.\n\nHave a good day. ^^",
