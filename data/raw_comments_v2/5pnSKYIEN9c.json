Elevation does not work, \nunless the leg is above the heart (and who can do this in economy class?). \nWalking around in a tight space is also not the best solution as there is \njust not enough space to walk. A good solution is to get compression \nstockings, this prevents swelling and pooling of blood in your legs and \ndecrease the likelihood of a blood clot. Compression stockings should be \n20-30mmHg to counter the decrease air pressure at higher altitude.\ufeff",
