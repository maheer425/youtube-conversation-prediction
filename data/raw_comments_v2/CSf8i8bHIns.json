Where you remember \neverything is a different thing.\nThese are the times I've experienced hypnogogic jerks.\n(This May get boring now)\n\n1. When I was somewhere from 6-10 I had a dream where was dangling off the \nside of a building. I was screaming for my mom and then I noticed she \ncouldn't hear me, she was nowhere near me. I let go and fell and \nmilliseconds before I hit the ground I wake up and my legs fly up (it's \nweird)\n2 When I was from 7-9 I had a dream that I was in a post-apocalyptic \nversion of my house. I heard footsteps and the front door opening so I had \nto decide; hide behind the door or the dresser. Before I could hide, a \nversion of the chainsaw majini from resident evil 5 comes into my room and \npicks me up by my ankle and flings me through the window. Yet again, I wake \nup just before I land.\n\n3. Sometime between 5-10. I had a dream where I was in some sort of temple \nwith tons of door frames. Every time I tried to go through one, a black \n(not racist, it was like a cartoony black, like a monster's) hand would \ncome from the side of the door. After a while if doing this, I got to the \ntop of the temple. There was one final door and I tried to go through it \nbut I slipped with my feet going backwards (I was going to faceplant) The \nblack hand pushed me off if the roof of the temple and I fell about 5 \nstories to the ground, I wake up.\n\n\nAnd people tell me I'm stupid because I'm scared of heights \ufeff",

Then youz sometimes imagine how a job \ninterview could be happening, other times you plan in your had which routes \nto take on a trip, or there is times when you plan what you're going to \nwrite, draw, say, etc.... so i think that sometimes you might imagine an \nevent, happening on a place that you have never been before or barely know, \nwith people that you have never talked to before and so on and you imagine \nhow it all could happen, and it is perhaps a thing / event that might \nhappen in the future ... you think about it, then perhaps let it go or just \nforget it ... yet it still might be in your memory ... and sometimes it \njust might so happen that it happens just how you have imagined it, or \npretty much how you have imagined it and then you're like \"oh, i've already \nbeen here before, i've already lived this moment!\" ... and or when it comes \nto dreams- what i have read or heard so far is that in dreams we sometimes \n\"deal\" with things that might come up and so even in dreams we might dream \nabout upcoming events, then it happens - i guess you get the idea.\ufeff",

            "text": "Youre wrong. You are one hundred and fifty percent wrong. Ive gotten Deja \nVu mutiple times and everytime i got it, i recognized that it was something \ni had experienced in another lifetime. It wasnt just a feeling of \nfamiliarity, it was an experience that was so precise so crystal clear, i \nknew it was more than my mind playing tricks on me. It was something \ngreater... An external memory... Let me explain; An external memory is \nsomething that you experience in a life cycle that your mind has saved as a \ncheck point or as a message to ones own self, that you will recognize in \nthe same life experience but in another moment in time. Bringing you to an \nalternate reality and sense of familiarity. To understand this, you have to \nfirst understand time and more importantly, life. Time has no beginning or \nend. \"How is this relative to Deja Vu?\" Its relative because the mind and \nthe universe are one, traveling from experience to experience. Deja Vu is \nlike forseeing the future, except the future doesnt exist because time \ndoesnt actually exist. In reality, it just repeats. Its possible that \nthrough this infinite space and time, our lives repeat an infinite amount \nof times, and at any given moment your mind takes a snap shot of certain \nmoments in a life cycle. This is what Deja Vu is. It has nothing to do with \nepilepsy.. Or schizophrenia... Or any other brain disorder. Its also \npossible that Deja Vu and destiny coexist. \"How is this possible? And why?\" \nYou might ask... Well In external form the mind is in a state of \nperfection. Meaning we are in a state of perfect being. We know no greed, \nno pain, no fear, no emotions, no urges or sensations of the senses we gain \nfrom having a physical form. Because we arent in a physical form we are \nnothing but intelligence. Destiny would be described as our spiritual \nbeings choosing a forseen path. Almost like a challenge of will power. We \nare all destined to be great. So we choose a predetermined path. But as we \njourney through a life experience in physical form we stray from our \ndestined course. Maybe Deja Vu is a message to our physical being from our \nspiritual being, a message of/for good or bad. See science can only explain \nso much. And its often innaccurate, and denotes the truth, persuading \nothers to believe something false. When in fact our minds are telling us \nthe truth. The mind is a powerfull thing. You cant always rely on \nscientific explainations. \n\nFor example, the \"Big Bang Theory\". Its simply just a theory. It denotes a \nuniversal intelligence or a higher power, stating that life is random. But \nif life began from cosmic gases, then ill simply ask, what created those \ngases? And if something created those gases, then again, ill ask, what \ncreated that?? same thing can be asked about \"god\". Who or what created \ngod? And if so, what created that?? Theres always a new question to arise \nwith every answer. The questions become infinite, as well as the answers \ndo, until you reach the easiest explaination... Nothing. In the beginning \nthere was nothing. Nothing but black, empty, darkness. But if life and all \nthings began from nothing, than truly nothing is everything, because all \nthings derived from nothing. This is how we know time is actually infinite, \nand if time is infinite than it is also irrelevant. Why? Because if time is \ninfinite, life is infinite as well, and there is nothing to fear. The truth \nis life has no beginning or end. Yes our lives do...but that is the purpose \nof physicality. What we are experiencing in this moment is all we know. Its \nall we wanted to know, for a brief moment of infinity. This is the purpose \nof life, to experience. What is beyond this we only imagine. \n\n\ufeff",
