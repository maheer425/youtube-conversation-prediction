That's a horrible idea.\n\nAlso how did Bond survive the shot? See I'm fine with a spy movie taking \nsuch liberties but the fans of this movie take pride in the fact that it's \nSTEEPED in realism which doesn't make any sense to me as this movie wasn't \nrealistic in the slightest. From Bond surviving to Silva's plan.\n\nWhy is it considered to be such a great movie in the franchise when we \nclassics such as From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, OHMSS, and Casino \nRoyale?\n\nI'm just looking for a good discussion here and someone to explain to me \nwhy they loved this film. I've tried really hard to like but I just don't \nseem to be able to. Also the Bournification of Bond  really annoys me. He's \nso sad and gloomy all the time. You're JAMES BOND FFS.

Apparently Fleming didn't \napprove of Connery at first because he was a former body builder and had \ntoo many biceps and I have to wonder were he alive today if he'd approve of \nCraig because the same applies. Bond isn't a meat cake. The joke about \nJason Bourne is pretty spot on. They're treating Bond as if he's a stone \ncold government thug and while Bond was emotionally remote to a certain \ndegree he still had a refined nature to him that Craig as an actor \nlacks. Brosnan had it closer to the book Bond than Craig does.\ufeff",
