Sure, we do a little world history here and there but \nour major focus is on colonisation, the gold rush, mistreatment of \nAboriginal people and the parts we played in the war. We have giant ANZAC \nday celebrations and are constantly remembering our country's past, even if \nmost of our recorded history only dates back to 1788, thanks to European \nsettlers destructing Indigenous culture. Due to all these factors, we feel \nthat Australian history is very interesting and important, but people who \naren't Australian usually have no clue about Australian history, and this \nbaffles us due to the detail in which we study it at school.\ufeff",

            "text": "Cook was referred to as \"Lono.\"  The debate is not quite whether he was \nregarded as a god, but whether he was regarded as a god when he was alive, \nand by whom.  One of the big problems is that it is not clear what \"god\" \nmeans, or would have meant to people at the time.  The chiefs were \nconsidered to have differing levels of \"sacredness\" (or \"kapu\", a cognate \nof \"taboo\"). And then -- Lono had some human incarnations, and it's hard to \nknow if that's what is meant. Chiefs of the highest level of kapu were \ncalled divine (\"akua\" -- the word that is used for gods as well ).  Cook \ncertainly had a kapu attached to him, and he took part in a complex ritual \nthat is really difficult to interpret, but that seems to have formally \ninstalled him as a chief.  His remains were treated like those of a very \nhigh chief.  So \"god vs. chief\" doesn't really make sense as an either/or \nchoice. It's more like degrees of sacredness, with differing degrees \ninvolving different restrictions. \n\nIt's worth mentioning that punishment for violation of rules of  kapu in \nsome cases was death, with the victim offered as a human sacrifice to the \ngod.\ufeff",

An unknown group of Hawaiians took one of \nCook's small boats.[citation needed] The evening when the cutter was taken, \nthe people had become \"insolent\" even with threats to fire upon them. Cook \nwas forced into a wild goose chase that ended with his return to the ship \nfrustrated.[47] He attempted to take as hostage the King of Hawai\u02bbi, \nKalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu.\n\nThat following day, 14 February 1779, Cook marched through the village to \nretrieve the King. Cook took the ali\u02bbi nui by his own hand and led him \nwillingly away. One of Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu's favorite wives, Kanekapolei and two \nchiefs approached the group as they were heading to boats. They pleaded \nwith the king not to go until he stopped and sat where he stood. An old \nKahuna (priest), chanting rapidly while holding out a coconut, attempted to \ndistract Cook and his men as a large crowd began to form at the shore. The \nking began to understand that Cook was his enemy.[47] As Cook turned his \nback to help launch the boats, he was struck on the head by the villagers \nand then stabbed to death as he fell on his face in the surf.[48] He was \nfirst struck on the head with a club by a chief named Kalaimanokaho\u02bbowaha \nor Kana\u02bbina (namesake of Charles Kana'ina) and then stabbed by one of the \nking's attendants, Nuaa.[49][50] The Hawaiians carried his body away \ntowards the back of the town, still visible to the ship through their \nspyglass. Four marines, Corporal James Thomas, Private Theophilus Hinks, \nPrivate Thomas Fatchett and Private John Allen, were also killed and two \nothers were wounded in the confrontation.\n\nAftermath\nThe esteem which the islanders nevertheless held for Cook caused them to \nretain his body. Following their practice of the time, they prepared his \nbody with funerary rituals usually reserved for the chiefs and highest \nelders of the society. The body was disembowelled, baked to facilitate \nremoval of the flesh, and the bones were carefully cleaned for preservation \nas religious icons in a fashion somewhat reminiscent of the treatment of \nEuropean saints in the Middle Ages. Some of Cook's remains, thus preserved, \nwere eventually returned to his crew for a formal burial at sea.\n\nNote - They gave him the rites due to a chief not a god or saint.\n\nDavid Samwell, who sailed with Cook on the Resolution, wrote of him: \"He \nwas a modest man, and rather bashful; of an agreeable lively conversation, \nsensible and intelligent. In temper he was somewhat hasty, but of a \ndisposition the most friendly, benevolent and humane. His person was above \nsix feet high: and, though a good looking man, he was plain both in dress \nand appearance. His face was full of expression: his nose extremely well \nshaped: his eyes which were small and of a brown cast, were quick and \npiercing; his eyebrows prominent, which gave his countenance altogether an \nair of austerity.\"[55]\ufeff",

The Queen of England formerly recognized Hawaii as an \nindependent kingdom (even though many other powers didn't). Look up the \nPaulet Affair and the response from England (There's a reason there is a \nPark named after a British Admiral).\n\nLooking into the final overthrow, it was primarily due to the high sugar \ntaxes that were imposed on imported sugar. Before the Civil War ended, the \nNorth actually got their sugar supply from California and Hawaii (Today \ncalled C&H Sugar-look em up). After the war, sugar was one of the only \nprofitable crop the South was able to grow in large numbers, so all \n\"foreign\" sugar was heavily taxed. The loophole in the system, per-se- was \nto become an annexed territory, or a fully fledged state. Sad part was, \nthese plantation owners were descendants of the missionaries that arrived \nmuch earlier, and essentially tricked (akin to Paulet) the American \nsoldiers harbored on Oahu, saying that American lives were threatened by \nthe current monarch, Lili\u02bbuokalani.\n\nIf anyone is interested in more detailed histories about Hawaiian history, \nI'd recommend Shoal of Time by Daws. There isn't much Native Hawaiian \nhistory, but lots of it does come from valid sources present (mainly \nEuropean/American--at least regarding the \"Ancient\" history).",
