I then \nhad a couple premonitions as i was a bit older 17-20 one was of stepfather \ncutting his arm but i was not the first thing i remembered of my dream it \nwas a game i was trying to figure out how to beat till i dreamed how and \nsucceeded, which when i did the same thing in real life triggered the \nmemory of my stepfather cutting his arm followed by the sound of glass \nbreaking as he put it through the porch door. other was a dream of my \nstepmother in a robe like u wear in a doctors office sitting up off a metal \ntable and looking at me with a smile, when i woke up it all clicked and i \ncried told my grandmother she was going to die and the next day i got a \nphone call from my father saying she had a heart attack. after that dream \nare very far in between and still usually unclear, but most of the time it \nis just black boredom and i wake up or half wake up in the darkness trying \nto make an image pop. last dream i had was about 5-6yrs ago and it was of \nall the rooms in my house rearranging themselves like a giant puzzle.\ufeff",
