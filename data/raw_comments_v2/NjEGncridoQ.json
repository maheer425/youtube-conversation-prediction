On reaching India \nin October 1502, Gama's fleet set about capturing any Arab vessel he came \nacross in Indian waters, most notoriously the Miri, a pilgrim ship from \nMecca, whose passengers he had massacred in open water.[24] He then \nappeared before Calicut, demanding redress for the treatment meted out to \nCabral. While the Zamorin was willing to sign a new treaty,[25] Da Gama \nmade a preposterous call to the Hindu king to expel all Muslims from \nCalicut before beginning negotiations, which was naturally turned down. The \nPortuguese fleet then bombarded the city for nearly two days from the sea \nshore, severely damaging the unfortified city. He also captured several \nrice vessels and barbarously cut off the crew's hands, ears and noses, \ndispatching them with an insulting note to the Zamorin.[26]\n\n\nA depiction of da Gama's fleet (from the Livro das Armadas).\nThe violent treatment meted out by da Gama quickly brought trade along the \nMalabar Coast of India, upon which Calicut depended, to a standstill. But \nthe Zamorin nonetheless refused to submit to Portuguese terms, and even \nventured to hire a fleet of strong warships to challenge da Gama's armada \n(which da Gama managed to defeat in a naval battle before Calicut harbor). \nDa Gama loaded up with spices at Cochin and Cannanore, small nearby \nkingdoms, half-vassal and half-at-war with the Zamorin, whose alliances had \nbeen secured by prior Portuguese fleets. The 4th armada left India in early \n1503. Da Gama left behind a small squadron of caravels, under the command \nof his uncle, Vicente Sodr\u00e9, to patrol the Indian coast, continue harassing \nCalicut shipping and protect the Portuguese factories at Cochin and \nCannanore from the Zamorin's inevitable reprisals.\ufeff",
