Do you even have an idea about whats going? and \nnot what one side or another says, but what really is going on? Of you \ncourse don't have all the facts because you're biased on one side of the \nargument when there is twelve million different factions...If i've learned \nanything from my time apart from humanity, and my many years as a gamer, \nits this:\n1. Everything is relative. Who what when where how and why are the \nquestions you ask... but do you ever really have an answer?\n2. History is created by the victors. Who ever won, or caused someone to \nwin, has bragging rights... basically the history of war in general has \nbeen a huge bragging contest between winners.\n3. Humans are a very subjective species. More so that they think \"morals\" \nand \"ethics\" is a natural thing... no its never been that simple the more \nyou believe it is the harder and colder this life will be. and for some \nreason they think of \"darkness\" as evil when that's not the case.\n4.Our minds are able to achieve seemingly impossible feats...but we hold \nourselves back.\nand stick with me now...\n5. I think we all fight for this truth justice liberty freedom and, for \nsome, or gods beliefs and cultural because deep down we all want some sort \nof absolution. \"if i do this right then i'll be rewarded, loved and \npraised, instead of condemn hated and punished\" kind of that...which is a \ngood thought, but when one societies ideas collide with another... well \nthat's when war happens. \nabsolution...its not a bad thing i guess, but in order for us to move into \nthe future we must be able to realize that we don't have all the answers. \nbut we'd be damned to oblivion if we didn't try to find them. whelp that's \nmy thought at least. \nBasically its not about morals or ethics or whats right or wrong, its about \nhow the human mind works. once we crack that code... well we've figured out \none of our biggest mysteries.
