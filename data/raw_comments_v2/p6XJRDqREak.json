To high of a \nblood sugar can result in bad things, so the body creates a magical \nsubstance called insulin to save your life. It bonds to the sugar and \ncreates body fat, which is then stored in your body. It then burns this \nover time at a more steady rate in order to keep the sugar from revealing \nits true nature as a dose based toxin.\n\nSadly, the food industry has packed their foods with sugar because sugar is \naddictive (x8 more than cocaine) and raises sales. in the 1980s, fats were \nreplaced with sugar, and the obesity epidemic had been started up \n(ironically, the government had been trying to cut our waist sizes)\n\nIts not calories in calories out, but what kind of calorie you are \nconsuming.\ufeff",
