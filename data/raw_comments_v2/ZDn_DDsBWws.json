            "text": "+Abel Carbonell To add, enter each number at a time and turn the handle \nonce. To subtract, you pull the handle up so you can see the red stem. Then \nturn the handle in the same direction and the number is deducted from the \ntotal. Division is repeated subtraction. If you ask: what is 27 divided by \n3? you are asking: how many times can you subract 3 from 27? So start off \nby zeroing the calculator and add 27. Zero the \"number of turns\" register, \nbut not the \"total\" register. Set the number 3 and turn the handle until \nthe 27 is reduced to zero. The \"number of turns\" register shows 9, which is \nyour answer. For large numbers, do it a digit at a time, as for \nmultiplication. For square roots,set up the number, then subtract the odd \nnumbers 1,3,5,7.... until the number is reduced to zero. If you start off \nwith 16 and deduct 1 3 5 and 7 the total will be reduced to zero and you \nwill have turned the handle 4 times. That is the answer. Easy peasy, unless \nyou lose track.",

If you know how fast you are supposed to \ngo, you can know how much time should have elapsed for each unit (10th or \n100th of a mile) of distance.
