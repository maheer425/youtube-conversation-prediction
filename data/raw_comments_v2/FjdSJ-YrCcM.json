In this video, we explain how to \nget the most out of your pedal stroke with a few simple tips from the pros. \nFollow GCN on Youtube: \n\nFirstly, we look at eliminating dead spots in the pedal stroke. Scraping \nback with your foot at the base of the pedal stroke, and then pulling up \nwith your hip flexors. \n\nWe cover the differences between in and out of the saddle, and give tips on \nhow to get the most out of your pedal stroke when out of the saddle too. \n\nWe also pass on hard earned Pro Tips, pedalling training drills, riding \nwith a slow cadence and also riding one legged. \n\nAll this and more, straight from the pros. \ufeff",
