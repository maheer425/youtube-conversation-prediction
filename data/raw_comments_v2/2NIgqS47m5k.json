At its core, perhaps, war is \njust another name for death, and yet any soldier will tell you, if he tells \nthe truth, that proximity to death brings with it a corresponding proximity \nto life. After a firefight, there is always the immense pleasure of \naliveness. The trees are alive. The grass, the soil\u2014everything. All around \nyou things are purely living, and you among them, and the aliveness makes \nyou tremble. You feel an intense, out-of-the-skin awareness of your living \nself\u2014your truest self, the human being you want to be and then become by \nthe force of wanting it. In the midst of evil you want to be a good man. \nYou want decency. You want justice and courtesy and human concord, things \nyou never knew you wanted. There is a kind of largeness to it, a kind of \ngodliness. Though it\u2019s odd, you\u2019re never more alive than when you\u2019re almost \ndead. You recognize what\u2019s valuable. Freshly, as if for the first time, you \nlove what\u2019s best in yourself and in the world, all that might be lost. At \nthe hour of dusk you sit at your foxhole and look out on a wide river \nturning pinkish red, and at the mountains beyond, and although in the \nmorning you must cross the river and go into the mountains and do terrible \nthings and maybe die, even so, you find yourself studying the fine colors \non the river, you feel wonder and awe at the setting of the sun, and you \nare filled with a hard, aching love for how the world could be and always \nshould be, but now is not.\"\ufeff",

Can you please give me more detail, how it is \nrelated to sex and food which is the basis of human survival and don't even \nharm others? Some primitive instinct should be just, well, extinct, because \nit doesn't fit with the age we're in. And no, sex and food is still fucking \nimportant. War? No!\n\nI didn't refer to the war when you're attacked or to protect the weak. I \nrefer to how the US claim about the weapon of mass destruction (when \nthere's none) and keep messing around with Middle East (where there are \ntons of oil and $$$).\n\nAlso, yes, you do force your way of \"democracy\" and shove it up on other \ncountries's face. I mean, have some respect toward other \"way of living\" \nplease. Don't act like your way is the most superior ever and think of \nsomething like \"We're holier and better than thou\". Do you realize how \nfucked up the US system is? I mean, look at capitalism and how it has \nscrewed millions of American itself (many of them complaining about the \nevil and cruelty of that, yet no one o anything). Also, the thing is that, \nfamous economist even say that the US economy WILL going downhill. Only a \nMIRACLE could save the economy.",

It's bad and I think everyone with a common sense know \nthat war would destroy both sides in war. I don't care if you're more alive \nor something, but I think people have something called \"self-control, \nself-restriction\" from doing any bad deeds. It's something that differs us \nfrom other animal. Of course, you should be ashamed of letting your \nprimitive instinct of going to war without holding it back. I mean, look, \nif for instance, the US would press their need to be in war with other \ncountries and use their money for other stuff like education, healthcare, \nand better public infrastructure, those would be greater. However, they \njust like to be a 'world police' when they themselves had tons of unsolved \nproblem and facing an endless crisis.
