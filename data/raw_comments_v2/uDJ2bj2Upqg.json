I think the \nworst part about it all is that my mother and my sister think that long \ndistance relationships are \"stupid\", that they aren't real and they never \nwork out. The two years that we have spent together is pretty much hidden \nfrom our families because of their disapproval. It's not like it really \nmatters as we are adults ourselves, but I wish I could tell them without \nthem being judgmental about it. I want people to know about us.\n\nIt's hard enough being separate from someone in the same continent as you, \nbut seeing as he is across the ocean it can be more difficult. We have yet \nto meet face to face because of the costs, but I think we're finally \ngetting closer to meeting each other after saving up for so long. I can't \nexpress how refreshing that feeling is.\n\nBeing in a long distance relationships requires a lot of trust, time and \neffort. It's more challenging than any of the real relationships I have \nhad. However, I have never been so happy with someone before. True love can \naccomplish anything.\ufeff",

Now it's been year and a \nhalf that I'm waiting for him, hopefully he comes in July for a mounth. \nIt's hard, it hurts sometimes, this is kind of scary, but at the same time \nthis is excitng and we have an awesome relationship despite the distance. I \nlearn a lot from this relation, I feel like I'm \"stronger\" than before. \nThat sounds like bullshit anyway! For those who are in the same situation, \nhere some tips: \n-Never forget to say \"I love you\". Every single day. Since you're not able \nto kiss, to hug, having sex or anything else, this is the only way to show \nyour feelings. Use it! Even if you're mad. And even when you're together! \n-Girls, not seeing your significant other does not mean you can't use \nphysic seduction. I bought a nighty a few days ago and showed him on skype. \nHe loved it and got turned on. We'll have epic sex when he'll come, I \nguarantee it! \n-Have a goal together, it strengthens your relation. This is kinda hard to \nbe in a long distance relationship without any \"target\", the more you share \ntogether, the closer you'll be. We plan to live together. \n-You don't have anything to say about your day? Guess what, in a year and a \nhalf we NEVER asked each others how he's doing and how was the day. Most of \nthe time, we're just talking dumbshit and do a lot of stupid things, like \nmaking a dress out of a trashbag or find out how you can piss the other off \nthe most. Well, he's really good at it. This is like a game to us! Have \nyour own games!\n-I'm the party hard kind and my boyfriend is muslim, so he's the complete \nopposite. It doesn't bother him, because I always remember to send him a \nmessage like \"hey dude, I love you! And I'm kinda turned on! Have good \nnight!\". Even if I'm super wasted. It takes only 1 minute (or more \naccording how fucked up I am) and trust me, this means a lot!\n-Talk about your habits, your way of life, your friends and family! This is \npretty cool to know the other's environment!\ufeff",

I was already in a relationship and the guy was very emotionally \nabusive. I was scared to tell him no when he wanted to have sex and when I \ndid on the rare occasions he would yell and punch things. He eventually \nattempted to cheat on me when I eventually dumped him. All the while this \nwas going on, my friend on WoW was there for me and actually helped me in \nthe game. We would talk on vent and skype until he eventually asked me out \non Christmas Eve. We dated for 2 years and then an unfortunate event \nhappened between us during one of the visit that drove me to break up with \nhim. 6 went on and we went back and forth with talking and not talking. It \nwasn't until this year that we seriously started to talk again. We both \ndated other people but always found ourselves yearning for the other. He \nvisited me over spring break so we could see where we were at. Could we \nmove on or is this an actual feeling? During that visit, it was like it \nnever ended. We both refell in love with each other and now dating again. \nAlthough it has been rough with the distance, we are trying to plan on who \nmoves where. He lives in California and I live in Texas. By the end of 6 \nmonths we will both hopefully know.\ufeff",

In my case weve been together for four years, and all four years weve \nhad an extremely good but difficult time. She lives in Chile, I live in \nAustria...its tough. 6 hours of time difference is something insanely \ndifficult to get around, especially when one person doesnt have time and \nyou are basically relegated to communicating solely through whatsapp or \nfacebook just because these long distance calls (even through \nskype->house/cell phone) can be fucking expensive. \n\nits tough, but what I think helps a lot is if you know what youre getting \ninto when the relationship starts. If you know from the get-go this is is \nhow its gona be, that we wont see each other for 7+ months of the year, and \nyoure both ok with it, you dont really know too much about what youre \nmissing. All these couples, that start their relationships while they live \nin the same city or town, theyre used to being together, to simply go over \nto the others house/apartment, they get so used to it that its almost more \ndifficult for them to try a long distance relationship, because its that \nmuch more difficult. \n\nbut as long as you have a goal in sight its all worth it. For me its 10 \nmore months. 10 more months and itll be over (the long distance part), and \nthen 1-2 years later: marriage. I cant fucking wait =)\ufeff",

We're not together, sadly, but \nwe love each other still. It's hard not seeing him, not knowing how he \nsounds like...nothing. I know a lot about him, we'll sorta. We talk \neveryday...we usually talk like any other couple would but it's sad not \nbeing able to do the things you want to do with that person. He lives in \nanother country, which makes it even harder [i live in the U.S]. We want to \nmeet, once we do, we'll be a couple once again. (:\ufeff",
