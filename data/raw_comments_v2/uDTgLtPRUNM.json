It was cute in \nthe beginning, but it's getting a little old.  \n\nPacific Rim for example:  \n\nThe trailer lets you know this is not going to be a serious movie, just a \nwhole bunch of \"wham-bam, thank you ma'am fun\".  If they didn't spend \nENOUGH time on the robots, then THAT would be a sin.  Sure the characters \nare cookie-cutter... but you know what?  I like cookies, especially when \nthey're done just right.  You don't go into movies like this looking for \nthe small imperfections in the characters that you can relate to as a human \nbeing to give you some greater picture of the nature of humanity.  \n\nThese are what I like to call roller coaster films.  You don't go on a \nroller coaster fearing for your life (unless it's poorly built).  It's the \nups and downs and the sudden twists and turns that you want out of them, \ndespite the fact that you know precisely where you're going to end up.  The \nreal sins would be if they didn't deliver.  \n\nYou spend time calculating how many helicopters it would take to lift a \nJager... as if anyone is paying attention to the helicopters to begin with. \n And the 3 person Jager as being pointless despite the movie stating that \nit's the neural load they share, not control.   It's completely plausible \nthat the Kaiju went in two different directions - Cabo, Hong Kong, etc. if \nthere was more than one!  If they're coming from the middle, it's the same \ndistance!   And we know the walls are futile, they make mention of that in \nthe movie!!  And who cares if they call it the shatter dome??  It sounds \nbad-ass and that's all that matters.  Hell, I would take more issue with \nwhy Top Gun has a main character called 'Maverick'... is it because he's a \nmaverick?  Duh!  His call sign predicts all his actions in the film... and \nthat movie is a classic!\n\nAnd the fact that you bring up the whole \"Why don't they just put guns on \nthe coast!\"  Yeah, because that would make for an interesting film: \n \"Beckett, we need you to stop building this wall and sit in a turret for \nus,  our last guy got food poisoning.\"  \"Ok, sure!  Better than being on \ntop of a wall all day.\"  \n\nAll I'm saying is that you started out pointing out and complaining about \nstuff that really didn't make any sense (the eagles in LotR).  But you're \nleaving the realm of Nostalgia Critic, Angry Joe, and Angry Video Game Nerd \nand just moving into the realm of a nit-picky hater of everything.  Stick \nto bad movies, they're more fun to thrash.\ufeff",
