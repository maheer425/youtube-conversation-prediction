My 1st TomTom had a touchscreen \nin 2005 when there was no screen at all in any car, except the really \nexpensive ones. So this is not really future, but realising that it was \nmaybe about time to implement a touchscreen already. Cheaper car makers had \nit earlier than BMW, aftermarket radios even earlier. And i bet they`ll use \nthe cheap pressure screen any chinese portable GPS has instead of the more \nexpensive touch-responsive screen :D that`ll probably be a future \"feature\" \nor something. \n\nAnd voice commands... well, I had it and it is extremely fun to use while \nit is new. After some time you just don`t bother anymore because you want \nto just drive, listen to music or just the engine and not think about \nanything else. But it is definetly a cool \"dude look what my car does\" \nthing :) and a side note - if one wants to present himself as the maker of \nfuture (* a reference to the statement of to know the future you have to \ncreate it) it may be a good idea to check if all the things that count as \n\"it\" weren`t done before by someone else :) like the W212 MB which has \nvoice command since, dunno, 2009? 2010?\n\nBut whatever, I like to fool around a little and I`m looking forward to see \nthe final car even thou I like the old ones better and do not plan to buy \nit :)\ufeff",
