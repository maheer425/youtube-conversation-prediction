At best, they skim \nthrough this on a superficial level, looking for something to piss them \noff, and then when validated by a rather mundane detail, they go to town.  \nAt worst, they come here, complete with their own rigid, stubborn, \nnever-to-be-enlightened agendas, much more pleased with discarding \nthoughtful and educated discourse and opting for bold, not-thought-through \ndeclarations.  Occasionally someone will put some heart and soul into a \ncomment.  Not very often, but once in a while.\n\nLike...\n\nAs a history major, Green doesn't surprise me with concept.  Details, yes, \nbut the overarching historical and social concepts, I already have a good \ngrasp on, and I enjoy his take on them.  Occasionally he presents something \nthat I hadn't considered.  Truly, the phase of world imperialism he's \nreferring to in this video is actually rather short, only from about 1830 \nto the end of World War II.  We think of Europe dominating Africa for \ncenturies, but the reality he presents is, it only happened when warfaring \ntechnology gave the Europeans such a decided advantage.  So it begs the \nquestion, especially considering Sub-Saharan Africa, how did the UK, \nFrance, Belgium, Portugal, and any other power so deeply disturb the \ncontinent that it became a collection of nation basket cases, \npost-colonialism?  If Africa and Europe had been battling each other, each \nmore or less holding its own for pretty much all of history and probably \nbefore that, how did the European powers so deeply screw the continent up \nthat now we see them as little more than corrupt nations ignoring the \nplight of their people, one civil war after another with the occasional \nsmattering of genocide, perpetual guerrilla outfits armed by the \nsuperpowers, starving children with bloated bellies and flies on their \nfaces, and Ebola and HIV roaming the streets like the Grim Reaper \nincarnate?

            "text": "A couple things I'd like to point about this video:\n\nAlthough Europeans were incapable of colonizing Africa prior to the \nmid/late 19 century, that isn't entirely the reason they didn't attempt to \ndo so. Recall that prior to the industrial revolution, slaves were a major \ncommodity, and England was in control of the high seas, and triangular \ntrade. Triangular trade was already facilitating vast economic development \nfor the British empire through the trade of slaves for raw materials (that \nslaves produce), and then trading raw materials for finished goods, which \nwould then be distributed through European markets, and further used to \ntrade with Africans for more slaves. Europeans were already making money \nhand-over-fist through slave trade, why would they risk such a lucrative \ntrade arrangement? The answer, of course, is that they wouldn't. Once the \nindustrial revolution occurred, however, Atlantic Slave Trade/Triangular \nTrade became an obsolete business model for a number of reasons:\n\n1) Slaves weren't nearly as productive as paid workers\n\n2) There were a number of costs associated with upkeep (food, shelter, \nclothing etc)\n\n3) Machinery was quickly replacing the manual labourer. One paid worker \ncould produce more than 10 slaves in a day's work with the right equipment.\n\n4) The ability to produce more with less resulted in a surplus of goods, \nand no market for those goods, as Europe had been depleting the population \nof Africa for hundreds of years (If you look at population growth worldwide \nover those hundred years, every single other continent experienced \nexponential population growth, while Africa's population essentially \nremained the same).\n\n5) Slaves were becoming harder and harder to control. Many powers were \nlosing colonized territories to slave rebellions that Europeans were unable \nto quell.\n\nThe solution to this predicament is simple: End slavery, introduce \nColonialism. You develop new markets for surplus goods as you consolidate \nraw materials at ultra low costs, and effectively retain slavery through \nexploiting the human capital in colonized regions.\n\nAnother point: At the end of the video it is claimed that pretty much \neverything you buy comes from China, but that is only partially true. China \nis where most finished goods are produced, but the raw materials to make \nthose goods? They come from elsewhere. It's important to remember there is \na hierarchy associated with imperial hegemony. No single country can be \nassessed within the structure of imperialism without juxtaposing it to \nother countries within the imperial framework.\ufeff",
