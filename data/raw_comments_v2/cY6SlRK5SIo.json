In doing this he \nprayed no one else would meet their doom.\nThere one year, he heard a noise not familiar to this place. A little girl, \nwho stared upon him, with a smile and wonder in her face\nHe tried to run he tried to hide, but she thought it was a game. When she \ncaught him, and to his surprise, she gazed upon his face She did not \nscream, she did not die She was completely un-phased\nA witch's child, her name was Annie, the curse she was immune. When she \nlaughed, when they played, it made his heart beat as if anew.\nFor his search was over, Amumu finally meet a friend. Never was he sad \nagain, his curse was at its end.\ufeff",
