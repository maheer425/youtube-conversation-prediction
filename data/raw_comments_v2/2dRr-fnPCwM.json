The total mass of \na particle in motion comes partly from the mass of the particle itself \nknown as the rest mass (which is what the particle would 'weigh' if it \nwasn't moving) and partly from the mass equivalent of the energy of motion \ngiven by e=mc^2, known as inertial mass. Since it takes more energy to move \na heavy object than a light object, inertial mass is proportional to both \nthe rest mass and the speed of an object. Thus the more massive an object \nis, the more energy is required to accelerate it, therefore the more mass \nit has. It turns out that this is a vicious circle that prevents objects \nwith any rest mass at all from ever reaching the speed of light. Or to look \nat it another way, the lower the rest mass the faster you can make it go, \nhence the fastest things in the universe are those objects with zero rest \nmass, which happens to be the speed of light because we've named the speed \nof light after the speed of a zero rest mass particle, a photon of light. \nThe neutrino is also a zero rest mass particle and guess what it; travels \nat the speed of light too! There is one part of this I don't understand \nthough, I've often heard it said that massless particles are compelled to \ntravel at the speed of light, but never heard an explanation as to why in \nlayman's terms.",

According to relativity, if you travel billions of light \nyears at the speed of light, it will seem instant for you.\n\nYou can also think about this like that : it is impossible to go faster \nthan the speed of light because when you get near the speed of light, going \nfaster and faster does not increase you speed anymore, but it causes the \nspace to bend (shrink) before you, so the distances decrease. If you manage \nto reach the speed of light, the whole universe before you would have \nshrunk into nothing. Going at the speed of light is synonym of getting from \nthe space and time (and maybe destroy the whole universe?).\n\nI think that in this condition, talking about \"instant\" or \"length\" has \njust no meaning.

I've watched enough videos and read \nenough articles to act like I know something, but I really do not. I \"know\" \nthat, given Schrodinger's equation, if \u03c8sub1, which is simply a wave \nfunction, is a solution and some other wave function  \u03c8sub2 is also a \nsolution, then basic calculus tells us \u03c8=\u03c8sub1+\u03c8sub2: which is where \nsuperpositioning comes from (a particle being in two places at once)! I \nalso \"know\" that because of the indefinite nature of the wave function \u03c8: \nwe can only solve for the probability of finding a particle in a given \nlocation at time t. This means that regardless of how much physical \ninformation you know about an object, relative to Schrodinger's equation, \nthe best we can hope for is still probabilities! This probabilistic \napproach is in bitter disagreement with classical mechanic's deterministic \napproach (aka everything can be known given the necessary data). This very \nconsideration is what provoked Einstein to write the famous quote, \"I, at \nany rate, am convinced that He [God] does not throw dice.\" And so yes, \nobviously, it helps to be vaguely (blindly in my case) versed in QM, as it \ngives you a context for many historical events and QM interpretations. I \njust hate it when people act like they understand QM in it's entirety, as \nI'm pretty sure physicists themselves are having a difficult time finding \nthe correct interpretation of QM: assuming we're not missing pieces of the \npuzzle!
