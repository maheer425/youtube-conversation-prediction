I finally cried and cried for a while before \nsomebody put a bottle in my mouth. It tasted like formula and I didn't like \nit, I wanted milk but I was being weaned from the breast at the time and \ncouldn't understand the change. Later I graduated to using a tippy cup.\n I remember my diapers being changed. At first they were folding in a \ntriangle and pinned under my belly button, one day my father was struggling \nto get one on me, he couldn't get the ends together enough to pin them and \nmy mother had to show him how to fold it differently and pin it with two \npins because I had gotten bigger and even later after I started walking, my \nmother started using disposable diapers. The disposables had tape on a wax \npaper sheet and My mother would run out of tape so she resorted to masking \ntape. I hated disposables and would rip them off at every chance. I was \nbetween one and two by that time.\n  I remember being in my high chair and wiggling out of it because I didn't \nwant to be in it.\n  I remember being bewildered all the time, constantly trying to figure out \nwhat was going on. When babies look puzzled, they really are.\n I remember laying in my crib, sucking my thumb with my legs crossed, right \nfoot over the left knee, my dad thought that was funny.\n I remember discovering my feet and sucking my toes. I remember crawling \naround a large braided carpet, I can't remember if this was a carpet in our \nhouse or if it was my Grandmothers.\n I remember being stuck in my crib and hating it. When I got bigger I \nlearned how to climb out of it, this was especially easy if my dad forgot \nto raise the side. They lowered the mattress and I was stuck again for a \nwhile, eventually though I was so good at getting out my parents finally \nbought me a regular bed to sleep on. I was between two and three by then.\n Hope you enjoyed my walk down memory lane! :)",

And the \nSpirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.\n\nThe First Day: Light\n\n3And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 4And God saw the \nlight, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. 5And \nGod called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening \nand the morning were the first day.\n\nThe Second Day: Firmament\n\n6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let \nit divide the waters from the waters. 7And God made the firmament, and \ndivided the waters which wereunder the firmament from the waters \nwhich were above the firmament: and it was so. 8And God called the \nfirmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.\n\nThe Third Day: Dry Ground\n\n9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto \none place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. 10And God called the \ndryland Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and \nGod saw that it was good. 11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, \nthe herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, \nwhose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.12And the earth \nbrought forth grass,and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree \nyielding fruit, whose seedwas in itself, after his kind: and God saw \nthat it was good. 13And the evening and the morning were the third day.\n\nThe Fourth Day: Sun, Moon, Stars\n\n14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to \ndivide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, \nand for days, and years: 15And let them be for lights in the firmament of \nthe heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.16And God made two \ngreat lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to \nrule the night: he madethe stars also. 17And God set them in the firmament \nof the heaven to give light upon the earth, 18And to rule over the day and \nover the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw \nthat it was good. 19And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.\n\nThe Fifth Day: Fish and Birds\n\n20And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature \nthat hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament \nof heaven. 21And God created great whales, and every living creature that \nmoveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and \nevery winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 22And God \nblessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the \nseas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. 23And the evening and the morning \nwere the fifth day.\n\nThe Sixth Day: Creatures on Land\n\n24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his \nkind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: \nand it was so.25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and \ncattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after \nhis kind: and God saw that it was good.\n\n26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let \nthem have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, \nand over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing \nthat creepeth upon the earth. 27So God created man in his own image, in the \nimage of God created he him; male and female created he them. 28And God \nblessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and \nreplenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the \nsea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth \nupon the earth.29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing \nseed, which isupon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the \nwhich is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for \nmeat. 30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and \nto every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have \ngiven every green herb for meat: and it was so.31And God saw every thing \nthat he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the \nmorning were the sixth day.\n\nes Bible\n\nThe Seventh Day: God Rests\n\n(Exodus 16:22-36; Hebrews 4:1-11)\n\n1Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of \nthem. 2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he \nrested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. 3And God \nblessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had \nrested from all his work which God created and made.\n\nThe Creation of Man\n\n4These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were \ncreated, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,5And \nevery plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the \nfield before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the \nearth, and there was not a man to till the ground. 6But there went up a \nmist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. 7And the \nLORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his \nnostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.\n\nThe Planting of the Garden\n\n8And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the \nman whom he had formed. 9And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow \nevery tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of \nlife also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and \nevil.\n\n10And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was \nparted, and became into four heads.11The name of the first is Pison: \nthat isit which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there \nis gold; 12And the gold of that land is good: there isbdellium and the onyx \nstone. 13And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that \ncompasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. 14And the name of the third \nriver is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And \nthe fourth river is Euphrates.\n\nThe Forbidden Fruit\n\n15And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to \ndress it and to keep it. 16And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of \nevery tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: 17But of the tree of the \nknowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that \nthou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\n\nAdam Names the Animals\n\n18And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I \nwill make him an help meet for him. 19And out of the ground the LORD God \nformed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and \nbrought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam \ncalled every living creature, that was the name thereof.20And Adam gave \nnames to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the \nfield; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.\n\nThe Creation of Woman\n\n21And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and \nhe took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; 22And the \nrib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought \nher unto the man.\n\n23And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she \nshall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.\n\n24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave \nunto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.25And they were both naked, the \nman and his wife, and were not ashamed.\n\n\n\ufeff",
