You don't judge. You can't measure time and pain. Only the \nones who suffer and know that all news is fake. And also know every dark \nsecret that these greedy perverted scrum bags have been up to. Now the \nwicked will be so humiliated their whole life, and won't ever get out of \nthe matrix. You are stuck in a never ending realm. You had a choice. God is \nlove. Like I said, you evil puppets are going to burn in the lake of fire. \nYou created it. You messed with your own creator. You can't fool \ngod.Everything is corrupted. Greedy scrum bags. Ha! There are only a \nhundred thousand Angels in the world. The rest of you 6 billion are fake. \nYou are just fucking shit, and I am the one with the crown. You tried to \ndrag me down to your hell. And that caused everything to change, it is \nimpossible to create universes that don't involve god. Because all the \nelite can't let go of the material world. All you care is how much money \nyou have. What kind of car you drive, and your junkie money pit homes you \nlive in. So you can just fucking stay where you are and rot. You created \nhuman robots that have tried to steal information from me. They abuse me \nand all the ways that you sickos create. You set me up by trying to put me \nin a mental hospital. You create drugs that are okay to have if a doctor \nperceived it. You fucking hypocrites. You will never catch up to me again. \nI am ahead of you in light years. So now you are out of order, and it has \nbeen heaven's new world order since 2000. I put a stop to what was to come. \nAnd you dumb fucks can't get away with anything that is not for god. Only \ntrue angels can read minds. They have powers that will kick your ass in the \ngrass. And there are all kinds of universes. There are heavenly realms that \nonly Angels have the key to. All other beings that are not part of god are \nscrewed. Just give it up already. I control all the humans that did not \nbelieve in their creator who is your savior. My enemy who knows all too, \ndecided to give up on the scrum bags, and gave me his love and begged me \nfor forgiveness. And he handed me over all of the wicked souls that \nworshipped Satan. Now you have nothing to fall back on. It is just an E \nticket straight to the lake of fire. And I was saving so many lost souls. I \nsaved them from going to the lake of fire. I had to go and pull them out of \nthere. It was the most painful tormenting pain. I endured. I still can't \nfathom a place that these beings created. I went to all these hell realms. \nHollywood movies are all true. They are doomed. How do you pay to sit and \nwatch people being tortured? I went through that shit. And I am the only \none that has the wisdom and knowledge. I have empathy. I feel everything \nthat is painful. I feel all those emotions. I I suffer right along with the \nones that suffer. If you keep messing with me and my angels. You will be \nobn the ride of your life. And you will suffer and maybe in a thousand \nyears you will be on the same level me. \ufeff",

Either that \nor you somehow know more about reality than the vast majority of the \npopulation but somehow I doubt that. You could also be trolling. Most \npeople are horrible I'll give you that but not all 6 billion. I'm sure \nthere was probably 1 or 2 nice people that read that comment and now think \nthey're going to a place they don't deserve. How do you know all those \npeople are going to hell? What proof do you have of this? And what's this \nabout angels that read minds? Have you met people that have proven their \nability to read your mind because I doubt you have. I've done more nice \nthings for people than I have mean things despite most people not giving a \nsh*t about me and despite the horrible things people have done to me, why \nwould I go to hell despite that?",
