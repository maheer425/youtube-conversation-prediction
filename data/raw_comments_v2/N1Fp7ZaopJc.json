I think he's saying that the fact that the rings are mostly inside \nthe Roche limit is good because it provides evidence of the maths behind \nthe Roche limit. Bits of rings outside the limit may have drifted further \nout (for whatever reason) after the parent body disintegrated. Moons aren't \npulled into the Roche limit for the self-same reason that the Earth isn't \nsucked into the sun; they are in orbit so do not fall closer to the planet \n(although the orbit may get slightly closer/tighter over very long periods \nof time). A Roche limit does not only exist in gas planets, rather it only \nexists in planets/stars large enough to have enough mass to tear things \napart. Rings are more common in the gas giants because their stronger \ngravitational pull is able to attract many more asteroids, so the number of \nasteroids that cross the Roche limit without hitting the planet itself \nincrease.",
