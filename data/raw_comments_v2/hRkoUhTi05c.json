And I've only recently started \ndrinking straight up coffee. The best drink is probably the vanilla latte, \nthough. The white chocolate latte is really good, but it's too sweet and \nrich, so even a tall is too much. My go-to drink on a hot day is a venti \niced coffee with hazelnut, and then on a cold day it's a grande hot coffee \nwith vanilla. Both under $3 and so delicious.

Go to starbucks and ask for a \n\"Surprise venti frappachino.\" It gives them a chance to have fun/experiment \nwith the drink, you will more than likely get a drink that's not on the \nmenu (I've gotten butterfingers and reeses flavors before), and it gives \nyou a chance to make conversation with the baristas. I don't even have to \norder anymore, they just make one, and I'm also known as the \"Frappachino \nguy.\"\n\nDon't do this if it's crowded though, then you're just an ass.\ufeff",
