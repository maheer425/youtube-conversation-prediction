I have known so many wonderful women throughout my life, \nmany of whom never heard these kinds of positive words said about \nthemselves. I suppose that might be partly because I am past the \nhalf-century mark in age, and when I was growing up things were much \ndifferent. With all of the emotion that the video for women stirred in me I \nwas eager to find one for men. I was not let down. The first time I watched \nthis one I cried also. \nIt may surprise some people, but many men, in the secret places inside \nourselves where we hide these things, do not believe in themselves either.\n I know I don't.\n Viewing this video gives me hope, courage, and the will to soldier on when \nsometimes I would really just like to give up. \nYou can be anybody, of any faith, or of no faith, and get something from \nthis man's words. What is wrong with saying empowering things about every \nhuman being? Our society has become increasingly negative, and perhaps \nthere is justification for that point of view. However, hearing empowering \npositive things will definitely help us change that negative feeling. \nSo, keep spouting your words Jon and I, as well as many others, will keep \nlistening.\ufeff",

I can \nchange the world. But like the different body parts, we all have different \nroles. None less important than another.
