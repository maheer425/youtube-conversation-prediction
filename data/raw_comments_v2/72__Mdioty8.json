HK will not survive without mainland: \nwater, food, and everything. don't say HK pays for it, mainland itself is \nshort of water and does not really need that small pack of HK$ for selling \nwater. 2. if you want to shut mainlanders out of HK, ask whether HK \nbusiness men agree or not. Because of the recent ugly violent attacks, the \nnumber of mainland tourist groups has dramatically dropped, and HK shop \nowners are bleeding. when you hate, think about what mainlanders bring. 3. \nplease treat mainlanders as brothers and sisters who have the same origin \nwith HKers and just did not receive as good education and experience for \nvarious reasons. When your own family behave badly you don't just cut your \nrelation with them; instead you will teach them what is right and proper. \nPlease do the same thing to mainlanders. you are not better than any one of \nthem. you just might be luckier. I say that much because I assume you are a \ncivilized person and not just one of those HK young attackers who do not \neven dare to show their faces under the sun.",
