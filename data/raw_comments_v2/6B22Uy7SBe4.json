Star Trek is supposed to be the future \nof Earth in the 23rd century. The starship Enterprise goes on a mission to \nexplore the outer regions of space and contact other worlds. Star Wars is \nabout an entirely different galaxy in another part of the universe where a \ngroup of people try to take down their evil ruler and set up a better \ngovernment. There is also quite a bit of difference in the tone and style \nof each series as well as the extremely different technology, space \nshuttles, planets, and lifestyle of the characters.",

            "text": "I, as someone new to the Star Trek franchise, liked this movie. The women \nmade me want to smash my head and Captain Kirk made me cringe in almost \nevery scene, but I genuinely enjoyed Benedict Cumberbatch's performance. I \ndon't know whether this is a negative point for the movie or not, but at \nsome point, I just stopped seeing him as a villain. Eventhough everyone \nelse other than scotty made me cringe, I watched and enjoyed the movie \nbecause of BC. HOWEVER, his performance would've been great for someone \ncalled William Edward Michaelson, not Khan. I'm from the middle east and I \nwas trying to figure out how on earth the most british guy on earth, with \nthe bluest eyes and palest skin could possibly be called \"Khan\". The \ncasting director made the best decision in the wrongest direction, 'cause \nlet's be serious, it would've been way worse if almost any other white \nactor was playing him.\ufeff",
