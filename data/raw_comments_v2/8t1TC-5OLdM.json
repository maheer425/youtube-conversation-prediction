The Church has a history of banning things and people doing them \nanyway. Sex outside of marriage, for one, or sodomy and sloth and gluttony, \nbut also musical instruments, the crossbow, pants... many things they \nbanned for theological reasons that made no sense to anyone but the 20 most \nbrilliant theologists in Rome, so they didn't succeed.\n\nThe number 0 and the Arabic numbers, generally, were banned for being \nArabic in origin (to them) in some places, but that's not why they were not \nused by everyone, given the advantadges in calculus and algebra. It's \nbecause common people, townsfolk, street sellers, shopkeepers and the like, \ndidn't understand them. They understood one, two, four and nine in Roman \nnumbers, because it's a more visual representation; you only need to know \nI, V, X, L and C. C and M come even on their own, since it's C for Centum \nand M for Mile, and the equivalent Italian words began with C and M anyway. \nAfter that it was a matter of adding and substracting, sometimes not even \nsubstracting (IIII for 4, CCCC for 400 or XXXX for 40 were common ways to \navoid IV, XC and IX, and having to substract). And there was a lot of \npeople that could read at that time, especially in the city (although not a \nlot could write, which is what they meant when they said \"illiteratus\" or \n\"analphabetus\", and historians debate still whether this means \"doesn't \nknow how to read\" or \"doesn't understand Latin\").\n\nBut you had to learn ten new cyphers. You could count that CCCCXX was four \ntimes a hundred and two times ten. You can't count 420 as easily. The \nshopkeeper could be lying. The scrivener could be faking the numbers. My \nwill could be falsely written under my very nose, because \"I legate my XX \nbooks on medicine to Antonio\" could be understood, but 20? Why is 2 in \nthere? And what's this 0?\n\nIt was a tricky thing, and probably this is not the only explanation, but \nit's one of them. It's not as simple as \"It was the work of the devil, of \nArabs, and we're at war with them, so ban them\". After all, the Crusades \nwas the time where more Arab things and concepts entered Europe. Most \nheraldic motiffs, for one: eagles from Byzantium and lions from Syria, \nthere you have the most popular heraldic charges in coats of arms, and they \nprobably came (it's a theory, of course) from the Middle East during the \nFirst Crusade.\ufeff",

Zero thus has to be removed and the LCM is only from 1-4, \nwhich means twelve rather than zero.
