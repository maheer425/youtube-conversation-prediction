A chef of \nyour level should only use tuna slices, I mean cutted from the entire fish \nwith the bone in the middle. Am I wrong?\ufeff",

Doing this will cool the cooking side avoiding charring. At the same \ntime the movement will not allow too much heat to penetrate the middle so \nit cooks slower towards the middle.  You will end up with a highly \n\"crusted\" not burned, meat that if seasoned well will be amazing.  However, \ndelicate meats like salmon and white fish would be risky as it can lose its \nintegrity and fall apart when flipping.",

Some meats, like chicken, have a \nvery real chance of infecting you with bacteria if not cooked properly, \nwhich is why you always have to cook chicken through. It's also why chicken \ncan be a tricky meat to get right, since a minute extra on the head could \npotentially overcook it, and make it dry.\n\nYou also have to cook through any meat that has been minced, since the \nmincing will distribute bacteria through the mix. With whole cuts of red \nmeat, the bacteria you need to worry about is on the outside, and browning \nthe meat will kill those off, while the inside won't be a problem. I'm \ntalking about fresh, well handled meat, but that goes without saying.",
