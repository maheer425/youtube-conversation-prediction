So don't say \"you send them to the world\"\n4) america is not the only country that has movies and TV shows that are \ninternational. That means america receives some of your movies/tv shows too \nwhether it's good or bad\n6) if you don't like what's on TV then you either change the channel or go \noutside and do something productive. And if you don't want to see a movie \nthen don't watch it. Problem solved.",

The school shootings are bad and \nI will not joke about them but after the first 3 it got hard to feel to \nbad. Turn on sky news \"and another school shooting today\" Oh good so your \ngonna bad guns, nope there was a debate about wether students and teachers \nshould have guns. Could you imagine that \"You got detention\" pulls out a \ngun bang bang teacher dead and another school shooting, or what about \nbullying over who has the coolest gun. So the debate on gun bans happen and \nagain the gun tooting nutts get all \"its our constitutional right to bare \narms\" Fair enough, so you would rather bare guns and have schools being \nshot up then have a lower murder rate and less guns? If thats the case stop \ntrying to make the rest of the world feel bad about your monthly gun \nshootings. There was one guy who made out that England has the highest \nmurder rate with guns in the world. We had 27 that year, i believe it was \n2011 or 2012 around the Newton shooting, where about 20 children died, a \nteacher and someone else. thats 22ish in ONE shooting and then you have all \nthe other \"unreported murders\" that dont hit the news so yeah gotta love \nthat quote from a gun expert of the USA. Make America safe and get rid of \nthe guns, or keep them and let children die, we in the uk dont give a shit",
