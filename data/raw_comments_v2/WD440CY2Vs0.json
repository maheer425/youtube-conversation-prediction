So we've internalized that dichotomy and treat \nourselves as slaves to our own internal masters. \n\nThe trick to solving procrastination? Learn that there is nothing you have \nto do in life except die. You don't have to shower, consequence you stink, \nyou don't have to work, consequence is you lose your job and money, etc etc\n\n\nThere are no have to's anywhere else in life, but death.

So certain there is no \nevidence, yet when presented with evidence, he makes up excuses at to why \nhe won't look at it. \nHey, it's okay to be an atheist. But don't sit there and think your \nposition is based on knowledge. You have no argument. You have no theory. \nYou have no evidence. You are just in a position of ignorance. You have no \nway of knowing what does not exist. You barely know what does exist. \nBeing an abrasive blindfolded skeptic to try to make yourself look \nintelligent is not fooling anyone, but maybe yourself. Confidence is not a \nproduct of true atheism. Humbleness is. \nI used to be an atheist for the first 31 years of my life. I listened to \nthe religious theories, when they were presented to me. It was only after I \ncould poke holes in their theories that I would dismiss their theories. But \ntoday's militant atheist doesn't bother with investigating claims. He just \ndismisses them without any investigation. And so he is but a fool. A \nblindfolded skeptic. A drunken asshole. And so the question is, \"Why?\" Why \nis the militant atheist such an asshole? It's clear that he was \nindoctrinated at one time, hated it and is so thrilled to have escaped it, \nthat he fears every other religion or theory about spirituality. Yes, the \nmilitant atheist is too scared to have any real integrity. Fear made him \nreligious, and now fear makes him a blindfolded atheist. You're too scared \nto face reality. And that's so sad, because reality isn't frightening at \nall. There's nothing to fear, but your own imaginary fears. Because they \nwill haunt you. They will drag you through hell.

Anyway, I have been a \nprocrastinator my whole life, and this is the first time someone put it \ninto perspective, that fear can override logic and keep you from doing \nthings you have to. I think following his tips will greatly help me get \nmore things done. It is quite an accomplishment to have founded 3 companies \nby the age of 20, despite having medical conditions and ADHD (which is why \nI did not find it annoying that he kept referring to his phone often.) The \ncompanies he founded: Good Books: non-profit enterprise which aims to give \nthe gift of education to orphanages overseas, by selling donated \neducational resources in Australia. One Can Grow: One Can Grow is a \nvalues-based organization which aims to educate High School students about \nMicro-finance and social entrepreneurship. Noble Online: Noble Online is a \nmarketing company focusing on digital marketing implementation and strategy \nconsultation. I wonder how much the complainers accomplished by the time \nthey were 20? Oh, that's right, they were too busy complaining!\ufeff",
