It shows us that the very small \ndoesn't behave like the very big. For example: you can throw a ball and if \nyou know the initial conditions you will know exactly where and when that \nball will hit the floor. If you make the ball as small as, let's say, an \nelectron, you can't predict anything for certain anymore. You can however \nsay that it will land at a certain spot 74% of the time. But perhaps 15 % \nit will land somewhere in the opposite direction and 0.001 percent of the \ntime it will land a hundred miles further. That is the weirndness of the \nquantum world. However this statistical fact is in a way inversely \nproportional with mass. Therefore of you make the ball big again, the \nchance of it landing anywhere else than predicted is statistically so \ninsignificant, that if you throw the ball 1 time per second, the lifetime \nof the universe wouldn't be long enough to probably see it happen just \nonce.
