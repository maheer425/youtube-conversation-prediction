This is called genetic \nshuffling (see \nhttp://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evo101/IIIC5aShufflingdetails.shtml). \nThis shuffling requires that the genes be highly the same structurally \nbetween the two individuals; if they aren't, genes can be functionally \nbroken, causing a dead foetus. I have seen it estimated that about 1/3 of \nall human matings die before the fertilized egg even implants for this \nreason.\n\n\nFortunately, most mutations are harmless or possibly even helpful. Those \nthat are deletory kill the result. The branches of sapiens and neanderthals \nwere both still very compatible, enough so that they could successfully \ninterbreed generally.

This is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of \nevolution but ultimately taxonomy as well. Besides the fact that you used \nterms with no scientific definition, I'll do my best to explain this. First \noff, \"kind\" refers to nothing. It is not a scientific term, it is not clear \nwhat this term describes, and it therefore should not be used in this \ncontext. Nevertheless, organisms never evolve out of their respective taxa. \nA tiger is a feliforme, but neither its ancestors nor its descendants have \nstopped or will stop being mammals. In other words, every organism in the \nTigers evolutionary lineage both past and future will never be a \n\"completely different kind of animal\". But again, we have undefined terms. \nWhat exactly is a \"completely different kind of animals\"? Even a Tiger and \na Crocodile share characteristics.\n\n\"As you said, a chihuahua could still breed with a wolfhound(not that that \nwould happen, but they COULD produce fertile offspring) so why is it that \nhumans cannot breed with chimps or bonobos?\"\n\nThe potential for two isolated populations to produce fertile offspring is \ndetermined by their chromosomal relationship and the recency of their \ndivergence. Chihuahuas and wolfhounds share the same number of chromosomes \nand their divergence was relatively recently. While it is possible for two \norganisms from populations with varying pairs of chromosomes to produce the \noccasional fertile offspring (30 documented cases of fertile mules in the \nlast few centuries), it is a rarity and is not the only determining factor \nnor the most important. African wild dogs, for instance, share 78 \nchromosomes with wolves, domesticated dogs, coyotes, etc... but cannot \ninterbreed with any. To your point, the simple fact is that we don't know \nif humans can interbreed with bonobos or chimps, nobody has ever really \ntried besides a deranged soviet scientist and it's not clear if his methods \nwere concrete. What does it matter anyway? Just because we share an \nevolutionary relationship with these two species doesn't mean we must be \ncapable of interbreeding.\n\n\"And as far as evolution happening at an imperceptibly slow pace, we should \nstill be able to see evolution happening on a cellular level at least every \n20 years. But we don't.\"\n\nEvolution is a system of population mechanics and inheritance.

            "text": "+CaveFreediving Alright. There is evidence that evolution is a thing. We \nhave the fossil record which can be used to look at earlier species, the \nchemical composition of organisms (I'm going with organisms here because \nanimals only applies to those organisms within kingdom Animalia, but does \nnot include bacteria, protists, and the like) which can be compared to see \nhow similar it is across species, homologous structures can be used to \ncompare similarities and differences between species, geographic \ndistributions of related species, and the recorded genetic change in \norganisms over a span of several generations. (source: \nhttp://anthro.palomar.edu/evolve/evolve_3.htm)\nSo speciation. First we need to define what a species is. There is still \nsome debate over what exactly a species is, but the most accepted \ndefinition is: A group of actually or potentially interbreeding organisms \nwhose offspring will produce fertile offspring. Pretty much the babies can \nmake babies. Once speciation occurs the two species generally cannot \nreproduce together because of various barriers. The barriers may be that \ntheir genetic code is too different to go through mitosis and meiosis \nwithout serious problems, or they reproduce differently. For example, we \n(humans) cannot reproduce with robins because the reproduction methods are \ndifferent. Humans have sexual intercourse which involves penetration while \nbirds have sexual intercourse but with no penetration (the males actually \ngive females sacks of sperm which the females place inside a canal of \nsorts). Since the reproduction methods are different, humans could not \nreproduce with birds. There's also the issue of size: Humans are much \nbigger than birds. Now, species can actually recombine into one species \n(which is a totally different form of speciation) and sometimes two species \ncan create hybrids. Mostly the hybrids are sterile and very compromised in \nterms of health. To sum up species can't reproduce with each other because \nof behavioral differences, genetic differences, reproduction differences, \nparts don't match, or geographic isolation. Now, I do agree with you on the \ndog breeding example. It can't really be used to prove speciation, but it \nis a handy example of how variation can occur and how selection (in this \ncase artificial selection) can happen.\nWe have actually observed evolution in action with fruit flies and \norganisms with sort generation periods. With fruit flies we can watch \nspeciation happen because a generation period is relatively short and they \nproduce lots of offspring. Since generation period is short we can observe \na genetic change as it passes through the generations in a small period of \ntime, say 10 generations in a week. That's enough time to see how the trait \naffects the adaption of the organism to the environment. This is, of \ncourse, an example of artificial selection.\nThe part of evolution that takes million of years is the change in whole \nkingdoms and the bigger classifications of organisms (domain, phylum, \nkingdom, class). Sometimes speciation takes million of years because of \nenvironmental conditions (environment refers to anything that affects the \norganisms. That is ecosystem, other organisms, weather patterns, food, etc) \nfluctuating quite a bit.\nScientists have lots of evidence of evolution. It may be called a theory, \nbut in science a theory is when a hypothesis has enough evidence to be \nconsidered fact and thus other hypotheses are based off of it. Evolution is \na scientific theory meaning that its scientific fact. It's is not, however, \na scientific law. In order to be a law, we (scientists) must be able to \npredict that it will happen and then observe it happening. We have proof \nthat verifies evolution, but we have no way of predicting when it may \nhappen or how it will happen. This is unlike gravity where we can predict \nthat if we drop a bowling ball from a certain height that it will hit the \nground at a certain speed and time. Just because evolution is called a \ntheory does not mean it is not fact. If it was a hypothesis it could be \ndisproven. \nAnd scientists can't directly observe evolution, but we observe its \naffects. It's like wind. We can't directly observe it (with vision), but we \ncan observe its affects upon the world and measure those affects. ",

Mammals have XY but birds \nand most reptiles have ZW. One of the X chromosomes has a gene that is on \nbirds Z chromosomes. I am not saying that mammals evolved from a platypus, \nbut the platypus is kind of what's left of mammals before they started \ngiving birth to live young! Obviously, giving birth to live young proved to \nbe more beneficial in mammals because the rest do it! So all the other \nmammals that use to lay eggs died out, but the platypus survived. Echidna \nevolved from platypus and also lay eggs. Then after that there are two \ntypes of mammals that give birth to live young, marsupials and placentals. \nMarsupials give birth to live young, but at a very early stage. So \npregnancy is short, and the baby has to grow outside the womb. They \ndeveloped in South America, but because Australia is now isolated they \nflourished there! From fossil records the birth canal is small on early \nmammals and so they probably gave birth like marsupials. Placental mammals, \nhave a placenta and carry young for a long time before giving birth. \nPregnancy is harder on than on marsupials, but considering the fact that \nmost mammals do it this way, it is obviously beneficial to species \nsurvival! Mammals evolved from reptiles just like birds did. When the \nruling reptiles (dinosaurs) fell, mammals and birds were able to rapidly \ntake over and diverse. There were mammals before the end of the dinosaurs, \nbut if the dinosaurs hadn't fallen they may not have amounted to much. Just \nlike marsupials did better in Australia than in South America because they \ndidn't have competition from placental mammals. So that is part of the \nreason why people can't see a reptile turning into a bird, or mammals. When \nthere is already something filling the space or role, it's hard for a new \nthing to come in and take over. It's better when there is space that is \nopen. And come on doesn't that whole process just seem awesome! ",
