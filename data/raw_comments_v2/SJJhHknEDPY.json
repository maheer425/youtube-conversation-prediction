This video explains dimensions WRONG. A 1D \nworld cannot curl up on itself in if there is only 1 direction to move \nalong. A string would not bend if it was constrained to one direction of \nmotion. Multiple dimensions are constituted of multiple orthogonal \ndirection vectors. This means that each measurement of spacial direction \nmust be 90 degrees from each other so that neither one involves another. If \nwe are all living on a 1D line of space that is curled up then, A) There \nmust be 3 dimensional directions available in space for the line to curl up \nthough. or B) There must be multiple 1D lines connected all points along \nour 1D line so that we can take free form paths to get from one point to \nanother instead of being constrained in every potential motion.\ufeff",

And \nwhen the atoms that make up our bodies displace space/time, it envelopes \nus, and that's what gives everything gravity.\n\nThe classic example is the Earth/grid example. Imagine the Earth on a 2D \ngrid, and it's mass is creating a dip in that grid. That dip is what \ncreates gravity. If something gets close enough to the dip, it will fall \ninto it. Now, this 2D grid is a simple example of what is happening in \nevery direction imaginable.\n\nSince space/time is a 3D idea, one can say that it is stationary relative \nto you as it is expanding as the universe expands. So when you walk a few \nsteps, you're displacing that space/time you're walking through, which is \nwhy you and everything with mass has gravity. And everything with gravity \nhas an effect on everything else with mass.\n\nIt's wild to think about it, but when you simply jump up, your gravity is \npulling the Earth towards you to an extremely extremely minute degree as \nthe Earth's gravity pulls back on you. It sounds crazy, but science proves \nit. The amount the Earth moves towards you would be 0.0000000000 onto who \nknows how many figures, but it happens.\n\nSame sort of physics and gravity principles that are behind the moon \ncreating tides on Earth and minutely affecting its position.\n\nI'm no physicist, just interested immensely in the topic, I'm an aerospace \nengineer (so I know what I need to know about physics, but what I want to \nlearn is the PhD type stuff), and what you were saying sounds a lot like \nwhat happens when matter displaces space/time.

Following that logic, any N \ndimensional universe can be traces back to a 1D folded universe in N \ndimensions, which is bizarrely awesome. I deal a lot with big sets of data \nat work (I'm a financial analyses), and I applied this idea to tables.

I was referring more to the looks of it.\n\nI think now I understand what you mean by folded. The 1 dimensional world \nwould touch itself everywhere, and those touch points would serve as \nwormholes. There would be no difference from a 3D world. Makes sense. No \nneed to go through all the trouble of making a flash animation, but thanks \nso much for helping me understand it now :D\n\nIf you are right, we can argue that any world with N space dimensions \n(where N is higher than 1) can be equal to 1 dimensional world arranged in \nin a N dimensional space.\n\nHere is my final question: something has to have  perfectly arranged this 1 \ndimensional world in a N dimensional space so it feels like it is N \ndimensional world. Any disturbances would look like spacious errors. If so \nis true, what natural forces could cause such arrangement?",

            "text": "+Lucas Balaminut I've watched interstellar (Pretty much a better Gravity in \nmy humble opinion), but it is still fictional. To determine what a wormhole \nlooks like, we need to witness one in reality (Although, I do believe that \nit will look somewhat like it did in Interstellar). I don't think it's what \nwould happen if we travelled through one, however. I'd imagine it'll be \ninstantaneous depending on how close the dimensions were folded \n(Instantaneous if the two folds were in contact). I don't think I can \nexplain it in the comments, but I'm sure if a 1-dimensional reality was \nfolded through 3 dimensions so that it pretty much covers every point you'd \nexpect to achieve in a third dimension, every atom, photon, fundamental \nparticle and field would instantaneously travel through to another point in \nthe 1-dimension and seem like it's moving through 3-dimensions because the \nfolds are in contact with every possible point.\n\nI could try to do an animation to help visualize it because it's hard to \nexplain unless you're experienced in the physics of lower and higher \ndimensions, but in the meantime this comment is going to be as much \ninformation as I can convey.\n\nE.g. an ant on a piece of paper, a 2-dimensional world. If I fold the two \nends through the third dimension, the ant can move across the 3rd dimension \nto reach the other end, but to the ant, it will still look like a 2d world. \nNow, If I get a sheet of paper and fold it five times so that it is 32 \nsheets thick, the ant can move alongside the 2-dimensional tops, but will \nbe able to go up and down, still likely without knowing it's traveling \nthrough 3-dimensions, but that's only if only senses through movement. If \nit could detect photons, which would also pass through the points where the \n2-dimensions are folding, the photon would carry the information of another \nsheet, so the ant would see another sheet, despite not being there. If an \nentity evolved in the folded dimension, it would be able to comprehend the \n3-dimensional folds, and be able to experience a 3-dimensional reality \nbecause it\u2019s utilising the particles that are falling into the folds.\n\nNow, image the 3-dimensional world is actually constructed of instead of 32 \nfolds, an infinite amount of folds so that it covers every point in the 3rd \ndimension, so photons would travel through the folds, atoms, electrons \netc... That would appear to be a straight line when looking at it in \n3-dimensions, but in the 1-dimensional realm, looks like it\u2019s appearing \nthen vanishing in an instant, which it would be in reality. We would evolve \nto detect those and because they're travelling across the folded \n1-dimensional space through the 3rd, we can't help but comprehend a \n3-dimensional universe because of the nature of the universe and how we \nevolved in it; like time dilation. We can't comprehend when there's time \ndilation affecting us, because we slow down with it. We would be able to \ncomprehend time dilation if we were extremely large beings with some form \nof organ that 'ticks' however, because we'll be able to compare how fast \nit's 'ticking' compared to another part of your body. So in summary, yes, a \n1-dimensional being would see it as completely distorted space that makes \nno sense, but we don\u2019t comprehend the 1-dimensional universe because we \nevolved through the result of the folding through 3-dimensions and utilise \nthe mechanics of how folded dimensions work.\n\n\nAfter saying all that though, it would still mean the universe has to have \n2 extra dimensions so that the 1st dimension is able to fold through. I \nthink Henry just worded it awkwardly. As I said before, I\u2019ll try and see if \nI can make a Flash Animation to help visualise it :)",
