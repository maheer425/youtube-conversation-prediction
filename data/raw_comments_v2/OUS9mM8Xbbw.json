The Constitution was amended in \n1961, but the first relevant election was in 1964.  The electors don't all \nmeet together in one meeting. The founding fathers were thinking about \nelectors being people other than the senators or representatives, who would \nbe in DC and know the individual presidential candidates better. \nNevertheless it states in the Constitution that the electors for each state \nmeet in their respective states. So the electors for New York don't meet or \nsee the electors for Kansas, Texas and Oregon and everywhere else.\ufeff",

To watch porn and \ntalk shit to people? You keep thinking small scale change and go improve \nyour local park, I will continue focusing on the big picture and find like \nminded people who want to create a new paradigm for our children to shape \nin the future. \n\nFinal thought: Bringing to light the problems within our system and digging \ndeep into them so that we may identify the root and remove it is \nacknowledging the problem and addressing it collectively to form a solution \nto the problem. If the problem persists due to a failure in it's \nacknowledgement caused by a cognitive dissonance which tells you to dismiss \nit as just complaining, leaving you to reduce the problem to an individual \nand there lack of involvement on the local scale then said problem will \nonly grow larger and more out of control with nobody there to even \nacknowledge it, it will eventually take over and there will be nothing that \ncan then be done to combat this problem. Good luck with your gardening. I \nhope the murdered children of Palestine and nations abroad haven't caused \nyou any type of financial stress due to your continued contribution to \ntheir death.

The United States isn't even a Country, it's a corporation, \nthat's why we have a President.

Freedom is the biggest lie ever sold and \nidiots drink it right up. The people's liberties are trampled over like \nit's fucking black friday at Wal-Mart! Try collecting rain water, try \nrefusing to give your child shots to their school, hell try and not take \nyour child to school and find out who that child belongs to. get caught \nwith marijuana, shit get arrested for anything and you will quickly find \nout how innocent till proven guilty you really are, stop paying car \nregistration or property taxes and find out how much you really own. Even \nif the Electors cast the vote for who the state's citizens voted for it \ndoesn't matter because you only have a choice between plan A and Plan B, \nboth of which arrive at the same place just take slightly different routes \nand any elected president that thinks he will take a detour from his set \nroute, well let's just say that doesn't happen since Kennedy was made an \nexample. The president is nothing more than a corporate talking head that \ntells the people what they want to hear and takes all the blame for \neverything wrong with the business but like all major corporations there \nexists a board of governors that are in place to make the real decisions \nand monitor their *Chief Executive*! Americans need to wake up and realize \nthat they are slaves, we were sold off over 100 years ago and that we don't \nown a fucking thing least of which is the choice of our president!

We are the richest country next to \nrussia of eastern europe, and there are more people living below the \npooverty line in the uk then in romania. fucking brits, hate them. if you \nwant to see a real documentary about romania you should watch \"the real \nromania\". both of these are free on youtube. mabye to see how discusting \nthese brits really are.",

The electoral college was not \ndesigned the way that CGP Grey describes it. CGP Grey then calls the \nelectoral college a 'failure' because it doesn't fit in with his distorted \nconcept of a nationwide popularity contest. Yes, the electoral college is \nin the US Constitution. Many nations around the world have used the US \nConstitution as a basis for their own constitutions. So Americans can't all \nbe dumbasses like you say. CGP Grey distorted and omitted important facts \nto make the US government look bad. You are wrong \ud83d\udc4e when you call me a \nright winger!

There was a terrible BBC propaganda \"documentary\" about \nRomanian immigrans in the UK (and bassicaly made us look like illegal \nmexicans), and all of those \"Romanians\" were actually gypsys, but the \navrage viewer  wouldn't know that. So, there was a protest in the UK by \nRomanians against that show, we stood up, and you don't.

The other states with different laws; way of living from those \nthree don't have a say so because their state population is so small. \nFounding fathers really weren't able to really have a stablish government \nuntil after 1812 because it wasnt really fair for smaller state. That's why \nwe have two houses. Congress is for the bigger states and the senate is for \nthe smaller states to elect two senators to repersent the smaller state, \nwhile congress is base on on how many county your state have. houses have \nThats why both houses have different powers to equal out the \"BEST\" way we \ncould base on a country with states. \n\nIn other Countries don't have to worry about the complex of laws in each \nstate because Germany is one State one country system so it can be base on \nmajority. EU is more like the US system but I believe EU is way complex \nthen the US and sortof of out of balance in many ways.\n\nVoting works in the same way, to try to be fair as possible for all states \nand the people that live that state. Each State has their own laws and \ntheir own values of people. (Hint is why our country is called the United \nStates) Each colony was different from the other and they all join together \nto become one perfect Union. Federal level (Washington DC is the power to \nhold them United by law)\n\n yes your house repersentive can vote either way but The majority of people \nof that state have the power to remove that resentive if they feel that \nreperstive is not serving them. Look what happen to the govenor of \ncalifornia.\n\n Its a circle of power. That is why the president isnt the most powerful \nperson in the US. The most powerful government is the supreme court that \nhas to go on the base of the Bill of Rights\n\nSo for example if we were to vote majority. If you live in the state of \nRhode Island with different values from the people from California or \nTexas, Tuff shit your values is worthless your state is meaningless in our \n form government. That is how our founding fathers from rhode island felt \nback then.\n\nNot by information travel from this video pointed out ..lol agree of course \nit was slower back then but that wasnt the main reason.

            "text": "+DeathWatcher I wouldn't go so far as to say Germany is one state, one \npeople. While the federal government has much more say with the laws in the \ncountry, the regions of Germany are quite different, as I'm sure you know \nhaving lived there, particularly in terms of culture. Germany didn't even \nexist as one country until the 1800s, so the regions have unique \nidentities. I mean look at language. At least in the United States, you can \ngo to California, Minnesota, and Alabama, and everyone's English will be \npretty much the same. In Germany, the dialects can be so different, even \nGermans have a hard time understanding each other unless they are speaking \nHochdeutsch. The differences between Bayerisch and Plattdeutsch actually \nshocked me lol. \n\n\nAnnnnd I'm not sure that you could say that only California, Texas, and New \nYork matter and would be the only states to decide the presidential \nelections. They made up 20% of the total votes (far from a majority), and \nit isn't as though the entire state voted the same way. In 2012, of the 13 \nmillion votes in California, Obama got 7.8 million and Romney got 4.8 \nmillion. To get a majority, you have to add up the total votes Obama \nreceived from about 43 states. So If Obama had campaigned in each state \nneeded to win a majority of the vote, he would have needed to do so in 43 \nstates---a lot higher than the number of states the two political parties \ntarget currently (maybe 10?). Also of interest, Florida actually had more \nvotes than Texas and New York in 2012 and 2008.",

So I have a better concept about \nother governments and cultures.\n\nYou are right on many points. Stereotype of Americans not caring about \nworld and cultures is sort of right. It's not because we are very vast, I'm \nnot saying this is all Americans but the ones I witness why they don't \ncare. Because people always say what is the point? If you put your self in \nAmericans shoes what is the point learning another language? You have \nCanada in the north mostly English speaking and corner speaks French. \nSouthern nations of American's are Spanish speaking.   Majority of US \nAmericans will never be able to visit Europe or any where. Europeans are \nright about American stereotype of idiots on world affairs.  Americans love \nfight with other Americans vs with other world cultures. Also have to look \nat other Americans not US Americans on this issue. Mexicans majority only \nknows Spanish little English. They only know one language. Canadians I have \nto say they are very into British still because they are still connected \nwith the queen. Majority only knows English and French.\n\nIn Europe You have many cultures and people and it is sort of required for \nyou to learn about other cultures and learn more then one \nlanguage.  Europeans care about other cultures while in America I believe \nAmericans don't have that issue because we feel like we are to far away \nfrom all of that. A normal American only worries about what type of job or \nfield he is going to get him/her self into. Family , kids and American \nlife. (right now we are in a battle What is the American dream and American \nlife these days?) That stereotype on Americans on being idiots on world \naffairs is sortof true what I've witness in my country to be fair. It's not \nall Americans but great number is.\n\nIf you watch video's of Europeans visit US is sorof true. Europeans are \nlike a rock star here. Americans love Europe because of stories of families \nwhere a lot of us migrant from. I'm Polish, Romanian, Irish, German and my \nfamily is confuse if we have Ukrainian or Russian in my family when the \npolish borders was switching. Europe is like where we came from kind of \nfeeling for a lot of us Americans.\n\nI had a German ex-girlfriend (She wasn't really German but raised in \nGermany) She got bombard with stupid questions from Americans. Foreign \nstudents and my pinpal from Germany was bombard with stupid questions. You \nare right on the stereotype.. lol\n\nOne thing you said that is right on, Internet is making our world alot \nsmaller. Cultures and people are able to connect more, play games and learn \nfrom each other. I think that's why European have a dislike of Americans \nbecause before movie and influence of American corporations in Europe seem \nlike Americans understood you guys but reality we do not. It is \ndisappointing being feed American influence when Americans know nothing \nabout you.\n\n If you really hung out with Americans we mostly put down our selves all \nthe time how we are not the best. Watch on tv how Americans fight each \nother how we are the worst nation in the world. I think when Americans say \nthat idiotic answer we are the best nation in the world, is because all we \nhear is from our own people and put down our nation all the time its hard \nto hear someone in another nation say it to our faces so then we put them \ndown..\n\ni think its a ego thing if you ask me. I'm just saying this what I've \nwitness there are many people with many reason but i believe majority its a \nego thing, reason Americans say we are the best to other countries. we have \nto be the best, but reality that person is probably also puts down the US \nall the time when talking about politics :) We know we are not perfect but \nno one is either.  It's a ego thing in This whole thing Americans think we \nare the best is stupid. Europe is uniting EU (sortof) lol and the power of \nthe internet people are learning more and more about each other. I feel \nlike our cultures are connecting more and learning about each other \nmore.Hope our governments can catch up and learn from the people. :)\n  ",

            "text": "Sry, I wasn't responding anymore.\nI was mistaken to begin with. As with many youtube comments, I expected \nsomeone to post something biased without any sources or knowledge on the \ntopic.\nSo when I read \"one country, one state\", I figured it was written by some \nguy who is like: \"Yeah other countries don't matter. Basically New York \nalone is bigger than all of Europe and countries like Germany are so small. \nThey are like a state in the US.\"\nI'm sorry, but I have encountered Americans with that opinion quite a lot \nrecently. And yes, when I told someone that there are actually 80 milion \npeople living in Germany, he responded with: \"Well, just New York has like \n200 milion inhabitants, so you really can't compare Europe to the US\".\nI am not kidding you.\n\nSo as I said, when I first read your comment, I thought of another \nuneducated American individual, and this being the internet, of course I \nhad to present my superiority by correcting your statement.\nDoesn't it feel good to be the only sane person in a pool of idiots?\nActually, it shouldn't. I knew what I was doing, and still, I acted like an \nasshole.\nWhy?\nMy only answer to that is: This is the Youtube comment section.\nSomething about this place where people with different backgrounds meet and \ndiscuss their opinions, makes it a place full of hate, egocentric world \nviews and idiocy.\nSo, you can either blame me, or blame the youtube community, which shaped \nme and you.\nBut after all, the interaction we can have on the internet, is the biggest \ngift of our time.\nAnd maybe, just maybe, this whole mess in comment sections is a good thing.\nOf course people are mean and stupid on here, but at least they care.\nAt least they try to discuss important topics and to see things in a bigger \npicture.\n\nInterest is very important. The most dangerous thing to humanity is not \ncaring about it.\nAnd Germany is a fine example of this. The latest elections on Saxony had a \nparticipation rate of 50%. That's terrible.\nEven with 7 major parties, which had a chance for seats in the Landtag in \nSaxony (and 6 of them got over the 5% mark), half the people still felt \nlike none of these 7 parties was worth voting for.\nIf 7 parties can't make you interested, then what can?\n(btw, 4 parties even got over 10%, one was at about 9)\nI love the fact that we have a system were many parties have a chance to \nwin, but somehow, our politicians fail to make the people care about their \nwork.\n\nAnyways, I'm rambling about things that are not on topic.\nI just wanted to apologize for my false impression.\nWith your next posts, you proved that you are actually quite well-informed \nabout many things and actually care about the world.\nWe need people like you.\n\nPS:\nAbout the whole Americans vs. Europeans thing.\nThe internet lately has been a gang war.\nHating on Americans has become fine entertainment for all other people, \nespecially Europeans.\nAt first, I thought this was a good movement. Many Americans don't get a \nchance to visit other nations that often, because their country is so vast. \nSo it's good if people on the internet make them challenge their world \nviews.\nHowever, nowadays people are not correcting you to educate you. They just \nfeel great when they make sure Americans feel bad.\nMost of us from the old continent believe that in every issue, we always \nhave the best solution, the best system, the best point of view.\nIf you look at it closely, Europeans on the internet have become much more \nnarrow-minded than other people.\nBecause we used to be so open-minded, we began thinking that we're better, \nand that made us the opposite.\nIt's still kinda a good thing, because this pro-Europe pride brings the 50 \nnations on this continent closer together than ever before.\nBut even if it is for a whole continent, it's still nationalism. Europeans \non the internet have become what they initially were fighting against. A \ngroup of superior feeling people.\nAnd I am also European. I also feel superior.\n\nBut your post made me realize that I was wrong. I realized what I've been \ndoing for the past years and that it has to stop.\nWe Europeans need to wake up. We have been looking at others so much that \nwe forgot to see the fault on our own side.\nThank you random American for reminding me that there is no \"best\".\nThere are many answers to the same question, and all we need to do as \nhumans is consider them all and care about the impact our actions have on \nour lives.\nLet's keep our minds open and embrace the fact that we can interact with \nfellow humans like never before.\n\nI salute you, Internet. Keep amazing me.\nAnd to all of you, have a nice day.\n- SPm",

Education structure is not \nbase on government, What kids learn is the only thing governments touch on \nin all nations. UN has a education requirements for all nations also :)\n\n\nI went to a public charter school. charter school means I can leave off of \ncampus and also shorter school hours, mostly your school work is done at \nhome. If you are not responsible you would be kicked out and go to a normal \npublic school. Either one I would still have to learn the same things and \npass the test with the same knowledge either or. there is example right \n there, that has nor bases on how the country is run by laws. in public \nschool, charter or a private school we have to learn certain subjects in \nall of them.\n\nI'm talking about in the US laws structure like Nevada can gamble and have \nprostitutes. Those things would put you into prison if it was in another \nstates.\n \nTexas you can shoot some one on your property that trespass and can get \naway with it. In other states you can't do that.\n\nCalifornia you can have Maryjane licenses While fedral law says its illegal,\n\nYou can't sell alcohol in Utah on Sundays.If you do you would be put into \njail Drinking laws are different in each state. Some bars have to close at \n2am and others can stay open 24/7. Some states does allow minors drink with \nparent guardians around in their homes. Some states say its against the law \nmatter what, State can take your child away if younger then 18, 18 you can \ngo to jail. Guam US territory you can drink as 18 years old.\n\ndriving laws are very different in each state in the US.\n\nIn Germany the law for driving is the same across the country, at age 16 \nGerman minors can drink beer or wine with out their guardians across \nGermany. its the same laws across the board across all the region's. \n\nEducation is a different structure on the learning base on the individual \nin the WORLD.

Go to north east of US its different laws and \ndifferent values. When I was in Germany the Germans in the east were the \nsame people in the west. laws are pretty much the same :) Like I said it is \none country.

Yes, the right of the electoral college \nto vote against the outcome of the popular vote exists in part because of \nthe difficult practical realities of life in US antiquity.\n\nBut they ALSO exist because the founders were equally as frightened of a \nconcept called the tyranny of the majority as much as they were the tyranny \nof aristocracy/monarchy/theocracy/individual all-powerful rules, etc etc, \nthat we are all so familiar with. There are times when the majority is \nwrong. And there's a reason there are virtually NO direct democracies on \nthe planet. They just don't work. There are numerous occasions on which a \nhuge number of people like something that is blatantly bad for them, and \nultimately deleterious to civic order.\n\nThus, it is completely unacceptible to pass a view point that the electoral \ncollege is just some antiquated artifact of a bygone set of conditions. The \nvery real threat of the tyranny of the majority still exists and can be \nseen in modern legal precedent. A great example of this coincides with the \nlong held tradition in the US that civil rights are NOT up for a vote. They \nare owed. Think about what would have happened in the 1960's if the \nconditions lobbied for by the civil rights movement had been put up for a \nvote: do you really think white people, and specifically white people of a \nnow outdated point of view, would have voted to allow minorities to have \nthe full share of civil rights they enjoyed? So you can see that a system \nof direct majority rule can be every bit as tyrannous as an out of control \nking and that, in the genuinely great tradition of the US government \ninstalling checks and balances to power, the electoral college is NECESSARY \nfor our form of (Jeffersonian) Democracy to exist.\ufeff",
