            "text": "I'm a singer/guitarist in a band and I've taken no lessons for either. \n I've been playing guitar for only 4 years and I've been singing for even \nless time.  Not to toot my own horn, because I'm not that flexible, but I \nwould say I'm fairly good at both.  I'm a firm believer that if you want to \nplay music, the best way is to learn only how to hold an instrument, and \nthen take it into a room and start to figure it out.  Then only AFTER \nyou've gotten your head around kinda how it works, and how to hold it, \nfigure out what you music you want to play, and then just start learning \nit.  The first song I ever learned on guitar was Thunderstruck by ACDC.  I \nhad an old acoustic guitar with a REALLY warped neck, and only 1 string, \nwith no guitar pick.  So i fashioned one out of a broken CD case that I \nmade into a triangle.  The string my guitar had was the second lowest and \nsecond largest string, the A, and Thunderstruck is played entirely on the \nB, the second highest and second smallest string.  So i tuned the A string \nup to a B note and looked at a tab for which notes to hit.  And slowly but \nsurely, I figured out how to play it.  Not very fast or clean, but I could \ndo it.  About a month or 2 later I convinced my dad to buy me an electric \nguitar, since the music I wanted to play was rock music.  And with only \nplaying for about 2 months on a 'real' guitar, I could already play things \nthat my friends that had been taking lessons for over a year, could not.  \n\nThe only little artifact that I've acquired that would be considered \n\"wrong\" is that I also learned Highway to Hell by ACDC shortly after I got \nthat guitar, and there is a D over f# chord that you play the low F# with \nyour thumb, followed by a G chord in the main riff, that I also played with \nmy thumb on the low G.  I saw angus do that in a live video, and to this \nday I still play G chords with my thumb because of that, unless I can't \nbecause of a change that requires a standard G, but it's still my go to \nfingering for a G chord.  \n\nSo in short, I would agree whole heartedly, that learning from a teacher \nmakes it much much slower to learn than figuring it out on your own.  \ufeff",

Couldn't care \nless if the person sitting adjacent plays violin at a certain grade level. \nSome people in the group may be playing at a higher/more technical level. \nOur job is to get through a few church hymns with a good sound. \n\nOn Christmas went to a dinner gathering. In the room were at least 4 people \nwho \"supposedly\" passed Gr. 6 piano at the conservatory level. Yet not one \nstill plays piano. Many people grew up taking music lessons as an academic \nexercise. They would get song books suggested by their teacher. Once they \nare done with each book then what comes next? Even when they get to play a \nChopin Nocturne they are following an expert teacher in Classical music as \nif there is just 1 correct way of doing the piece.\ufeff",

But how many children have access to an accomplished \nmusician?\n\nIn the US schools take music seriously as a subject and recognise it's \nbenefits. As a result music is everywhere and American musicians \ncontinually inspire aspiring musicians throughout the world.\n\nPerhaps in Ireland if Music Education was treated with greater importance \nas a subject, on par with science and maths, then maybe we too could have a \nbetter music industry as a result. How do you feel about this?\ufeff",

However \nI think what Victor was getting at was the whole language analogy and \nlearning music through conversation on our instruments.\nThat experience can only happen, as Victor points out, by having access to \nother 'expert' musicians as we learn and then in expressing ourselves in \nour language in a band or jamming situation. Most students I have would say \nthey prefer the interaction of a one on one lesson over self study in front \nof a computer.\n\nAgain if you take the language analogy, we don't learn to speak our native \nlanguage by listening to audio recordings of our family. We learn by \ninteracting, making mistakes and learning how to use this new language to \ncommunicate in our own individual and creative way. We learn how to express \nourselves as individuals through this process. If we all could learn music \nin that way perhaps it would be a far more natural process? \n\nThere is room for both I feel but I think we must never lose sight of the \nneed to come together and learn how to speak to one another through music.\n\nDo you agree?",

            "text": "*Music as Language - Victor Wooten*\nVictor Wooten is an amazing musician and a passionate educator. \nMy son +Felix Stickland posted this a couple of days ago and I  love what \nVictor has to say about music and children.\nPersonally I am so distracted by his amazing playing on this Ted video that \nit's difficult to appreciate the simple and elegant point that he is \nmaking, so I found the transcript. His words stand on their own.\n\nI see music, drawing and dance as intrinsic human languages and the way we \nnurture them in our children is crucial to whether we retain, enjoy and \nshare their use throughout our lives.\n\n\n\"Both music and verbal languages serve the same purpose.\n\u2022 They are both forms of expression.\n\u2022 They can be used as a way to communicate with others.\n\u2022 They can be read or written.\n\u2022 They can make you laugh or cry, think or question and can speak to one or \nmany.\n\u2022 And both can definitely make you move.\n\nIn some instances music works better than the spoken word, because it \ndoesn't have to be understood to be effective. Although many musicians \nagree that music is a language, it is rarely treated as such. Many of us \ntreat it as something that can only be learned by following a strict \nregimen, under the tutelage of a skilled teacher. This approach has been \nfollowed for hundreds of years with proven success, but it takes a long \ntime. Too long.\n\nThink about the first language you learn as a child. More importantly, \nthink about how you learned it. You were a baby when you first started \nspeaking and even though you spoke the language incorrectly you were \nallowed to make mistakes.\nAnd the more mistakes you made the more your parents smiled.\n\nLearning to speak was not something you were sent somewhere to do only a \nfew times a week. And the majority of the people you spoke to were not \nbeginners. They were already proficient speakers. Imagine your parents \nforcing you to only speak to other babies until you were good enough to \nspeak to them. You would probably be an adult before you could carry on a \nproper conversation.\n\n*To use a musical term, as a baby you were allowed to jam with \nprofessionals.*\n\nIf we approach music in the same natural way we aproached our first \nlanguage we will learn to speak it in the same short time it took to speak \nour first language. Proof of this could be seen in almost any family where \na child grows up with other musicians in the family.\n\nHere are a few keys to follow in learning or teaching music:\n\n\u2022 In the beginning embrace mistakes, instead of correcting them. Like a \nchild playing air guitar, there are no wrong notes.\n\n\u2022 Allow young musicians to play and perform with accomplished musicians on \na daily basis.\n\n\u2022 Encourage young musicians to play more than they practice. The more they \nplay the more they will practice on their own.\n\n\u2022 Music comes from the musician, not the instrument.\n\n\u2022 And most importantly, remember that a language works best when we have \nsomething interesting to say. Many music teachers never find out what the \nstudents have to say. We only tell them what they are supposed to say.\n\n\u2022 A child speaks a language for years, before they even learn the alphabet. \nToo many rules at the onset, will actually slow them down.\n\nIn my eyes, the approach to music should be the same.\nAfter all, music is a language too.\"\n\n#education   #children   #music   #language  \ufeff",
