I hate when \npeople calling someone a fat ass, ugly, stupid, gay, or any other freaking \nname they can think of. \n\nI was bullied in the third grade. A kid in the my class used to tease me \nand take my stuff. He would call me names like \"fugly\" and \"retarded.\" One \nday he punched me in the gut and I wouldn't tell my parents or anyone about \nthis because I was scared. I was scared he would get mad at me and punch me \nagain. This all went away until last year when I was in the 6th grade. I \nwould ride the bus home everyday and a kid in 8th grade would always throw \nthings at me and call me names. This year he is in 9th grade and i am in \n7th, and he was still making fun of me and now my friends. One day he took \nit to far and made fun of my friends, and he throw something that hit my \nfriend in the face and there was a giant bruise on his face. That was the \nday I decided to stand up for myself and my friends and I told him to shut \nthe hell up. This was also the day that he decided to grab me, push me into \na seat, and put me in a headlock. He choked me to the point where I \ncouldn't breath. My bus driver just sat there. I later informed the dean of \nstudents and although he saw the bus tapes he didn't punish the 9th grader. \nTo this day, he is still making fun of me. Please don't be a bully\ufeff",

I'll \ntell you what, the words do hurt. It feels as if you were put under a long \nsession of inexplicable pain and torment. You feel shot. Ripped apart. \nStabbed in the chest. The words create deep wounds that will sting. This \nsame process happens every day. Yet you guys don't know that. It is a pain \nthat will be different for others. You can't measure it. It happens on the \ninside. Not out. There isn't a way to treat the wounds you receive. You'll \njust get more the next day. Next day. Next day. Next day. Always the same. \nSome hurt more than others. A lot more. To all of you dislikers, have you \ngone through the pain? Have you ever experienced the agony? Did it linger \non so you'll never forget the cruelty that you've suffered? No. You've \nnever felt the torment before. The shots. The pieces they torn off of you. \nThe stabs that were left on your body. Yet you can't see it. It is \ninvisible. Yet, people who have done so all of the torment see it on them. \nThey feel out of place. They see one and only remedy to stop it all. To end \nit all. Yet, the remedy came with a large price. It be your parting. A \nbargain for your life in trade of relief. Suicide.\ufeff",

I've been picked on, \ncalled rashface and other immature things, and I won't lie. It hurt. But \nthen I tell myself, if I didn't have this, someone who may not be as strong \nmight. And I'm glad that I was born with this, because I'm taking it from \nsomeone who might not be able to handle the ridicule, the self \nconsciousness, the feeling of everyone staring, not at your face, but at \nyour arms, your neck, your legs as you walk away. I have been made stronger \nthan others, I have been given a reason to be a beacon for those who feel \nthey *can't.* You have been made stronger too. Anyone who feels that they \nare ugly, fat, dumb, not good enough... You have been given these \ninsecurities so that you can *overpower them.* You have been \ngiven obstacles so that you can climb to the top, be your best in the worst \nsituations, and along the way you build a rope of courage and confidence so \nthat you can help others on their journey to the top.
