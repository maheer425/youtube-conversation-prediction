For bread and crackers, \nalways check the total carbs on the box for the appropriate serving. Some \ncorn tortillas allow for 3 per serving and others 1. Also keep in mind \nother sources of carbs such as green beans, corn, sugary squashes that \ncontribute to the carbohydrate count. A diabetic may feel like eating more. \nKeep in mind, if you are eating more than \u00bd C carbs per meal, you should \nreally talk to your doctor about reducing your meds because more than \u00bd C \n(or 30 carbs or less) is what is appropriate for a meal. We are spoiled by \ndishes like fried rice and sushi that have much more rice than allowed. \nJust because your meds allow you to eat more doesn't mean that you should. \nFinally, keep in mind that the body changes ALL carbohydrates to sugar, as \nthat is what your body uses to keep you going. Before eating that extra \u00bd C \nrice or slice of bread, look on it as sugar added to the body.",

A lot of people when they move to a new place often put on weight \nbecause they're eating different foods and leading a different lifestyle. \nMy family hosted international students and we always sent them home a few \nkilos heavier from eating our kiwi food. I've spent the last year working \nhard to lose weight and don't want to ruin all my hard work. I want to \nenjoy the different food available in Korea but I'll try to balance it out \nby joining a gym. I'd love to know more about how gyms work in Korea so if \nyou have since tried out a gym since making this video and find out more \nabout it please make a video about it. \ufeff",
