I've \nheard people say you can't feel a tampon if it's inserted properly, but I \ncan still feel it the entire time I'm wearing it. The cramp it causes \ngenerally goes away within 30 minutes of putting it in, but I can still \nfeel it, especially when I sit down, or stand up from sitting, or move in \ngeneral. Even if I ignore the cramps, there's still the constant ache in my \nlower back, the fatigue, the insomnia, the upset stomach that leads to a \nwhole host of issues such as diarrhea, constipation, and gas. Yeah. I get \ngassy when I'm on my period. It's really annoying. Even though beans and \nbroccoli are staple foods in my diet, I'm generally not prone to \nflatulence. Like, I might fart once every few days at most normally. But I \nalmost make up for it when I'm on my period, and I feel like that's worse, \nbecause I can always tell by smell that I'm on my period, and I worry that \nit makes it glaringly obvious that I'm on my period.
