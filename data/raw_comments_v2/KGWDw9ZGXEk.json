I don't \nthink that \"greatness\" is a myth, really. I don't buy that there are a few \nhandfuls of individuals that history remembers purely by \nchance/circumstance. I think \"greatness\" in the \"being remembered by \nhistory\" sense comes from leading a life that affects so many other people \nthat culture takes notice of it. I think of the world like a pond, every \naction (and some cases of inaction) a person takes causes a ripple that \naffects everyone else to some degree eventually. Some people make a huge \nterrific great wave of a splash that changes the whole composition of the \nbody itself, or simply a series of larger ripples that go on long enough to \naccomplish the same feat. Those are the lives we remember because they had \nsuch impact, not because they were more \"interesting\" or \"passionate\" than \nany other person. Maybe it could have been anybody to invent the telephone, \nbut it was Bell. Maybe it could have been anyone to travel around the globe \nin one continuous voyage, but it was Magellan. It could have been anyone to \nconquer Asia, leaving countless bloodshed and *ahem* descendants in his \nwake, but it was Ghengis Khan.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not advocating the \"Great Person\" view of history, which \nis obviously wrong just by way of being too broad and not subtle in any \nway, shape, or form, I'm just trying to point out that you can't really \ndeny that the people we do remember have a larger than average effect on a \nhuge number of people. So it's not like those people are in some way \ngreater than anyone else, but it's more like they were great to more \npeople.\ufeff",

But even that isn't quite right because that just \nleaves you wondering by what mechanism you choose and you are back to \nsquare one waiting from something to jump out at you to help you choose.\n\nSo I like the idea in your video that you choose whether something is \nimportant or not because we assign value to things otherwise they will all \nalways all have the same objective value of nil. I feel like it's an \nawfully fragile sort of thought but maybe choosing to make something your \npassion, and accepting that maybe it'll turn out not to be quite exactly \nyour passion...is ok? Like the worst that could happen is that It'd give \nmore form to something I can be passionate about.\n\nThank you, maybe none of that made sense but it's like in games when you've \nbeen misunderstanding a mechanic or a puzzle and it suddenly slides into \nplace and a sensation of new options/areas/objects becoming available is \nexperienced. \ufeff",
