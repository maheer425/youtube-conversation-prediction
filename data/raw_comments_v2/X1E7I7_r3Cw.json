Also, to know that his original formula was talking of (unit) \nsquares somehow makes things more comprehensible. Everything was golden in \nPythagoras's perfect little world, until root 2 reared its ugly head. It \nconfused me that the legs had to both be even, yet the rules of how a \nsquare works magically filled my head ( after watching it 3 times) and blew \nmy mind. Go irrationality! I liked to see that everything can and was (at \nsome point) broken down to a simpler, nicer way.
