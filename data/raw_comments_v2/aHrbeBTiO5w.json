I don't see it, friends told me. This is not \nconscious. And when I speak with a girl, it not really happens (like \nsometimes she knows something more than me, but I can debate with her) .

The only thing that \nfollows from the premise, I think is that I think, which is merely a \ntautology. If you want to warrant the conclusion that I exist then you need \nmore premises.

It already assumes there really is an \"I\" in the first \npremise.
