However for the sake of maintaining a myth this salient \nfact is brushed over, sloppily.\nLet's remember who initiated the war, the United States, and that their key \nintention was a swift and decisive victory in Canada.\nThe fact the precise opposite happened should tell you who really won.\nThen the focus is thrown onto the British counter offensive into US \nterritory and it's apparent \"lack of success\". For fighting what started as \na defensive war only to end utterly repulsing the attackers and tearing a \nnew arsehole right across the aggressors territory, that is categorically \nNOT failure. British troops were operating on US soil right upto the war's \nofficial and technical conclusion (Capture of Fort Bowyer). There was no \nkicking out, simply an exit after causing terrible damage to the aggressor. \nThe fact that the US launched an offensive to start the war only to end up \nfighting a desperate defensive war as far South as New Orleans shows you \nwho really won.\n\n*Common misconception* #2: \"The USN defeated the Royal Navy\"\nThe US enjoyed some early frigate victories in the war against the \nstretched out British Naval Squadron operating out of Halifax. And later on \nhad success attacking British whaling and the likes in the Pacific and near \nthe Galapagos/ Western seaboard of South America. \nThis only happened for the wars first year. After the capture of the USS \nChesapeake by the HMS Shannon a trend set and the British evened the score \nin frigate actions. The Royal Navy went on to impose a devastating economic \nand trade naval blockade on the US, thus wrecking the US economy. The raids \nconducted under the supervision of John Borlase Warren terrified the \nChesapeake region and the British caught more prizes than the US.\nVentures like that of David Porter against British whaling ships in the \nPacific were put to an end when his ships the USS Essex and USS Essex \nJunior were taken by James Hillyar on the HMS Phoebe and HMS Cherub.\nThe total effect on the British maritime economy by the War of 1812, with \nBritish whaling recovering well, was negligible and didn't amount to more \nthan a scratch. \n\ufeff\ufeff",

Nor did ether party care about the well being of the other \nbeyond their value as allies against a common foe.\nLETS BE PERFECTLY CLEAR!\nThe USA did not commit genocide against natives because they were allied \nwith British. You slaughtered them because you wanted their lands.\nThe USA did not invade Canada cause the British were provoking Natives to \nbe Hostile to America. Your Nation did it because they wanted all of North \nAmerica.\nThere was never any substance to Madison's claims. No proof to back them. \nYou actually need proof before you can claim its a fact. I can provide \nquotes from Multiple War Hawks proving they intended conquest.\nTo continue to act as if Natives had no right to defend their lands \nregardless of any relationship with Britain is the very definition of \nRACIST. Boasting about \"Crushing\" Natives is disgusting. You should be \nashamed.\nLoosing an entrenched invasion force to a force half your size in a bluff \nwith scarce a shot fired is WAY worse then suffering high casualties to an \nentrenched force. One is cowardliness the other foolhardy, & wouldn't have \nhappened except for the lucky shot taking out the British commander who \nwould otherwise called off the attack earlier.\nDemilitarized the lakes in 1818. When you had the advantage. The USA \nstarted the 1812 war with control of the lakes because you had 10X the ship \nbuilding capacity then Canada did. You really can't boast about WINNING \ncontrol of the lakes from the British with out embarrassing questions as to \nhow the Hell did Britain get Control. They were sailing around in American \nships they took from you in the first weeks of the war. Do you get my point?\nSo long as you guys had better ship building capacity there never should \nhave been any contest on the lakes & WHY GIVE THAT ADVANTAGE UP?\nThe War was an American land Grab while Britain was fighting Napoleon. \nEverything else was just excuses to that end.",

It is racist to portray the \nNative struggle as a British plot. You really should know better in the \n21st century.\n3) The USA started the war with control of the lakes, lost it when the \nBritish captured your ships & while true the USA did manage to win control \nback pretty much lost it again with the Demilitarization of the lakes in \n1818. Once the Lakes were open to ocean traffic with the locks system its \nnow controlled by Canada. You Can't get to the lakes except through \nCanada's St. Lawrence Seaway.\n4) The Battle of New Orleans is over hyped as the same British force went \non to capture fort Boyer & was preparing to attack Mobil when news arrived \nof the USA giving up. Only memorable for the British lives lost.\nIn Comparison the Siege of Detroit captured not only the fort but the \nentire American invasion force 582 regulars 1,600+ militia\n& 30 guns.

And they do not have control of \nimmigration into their lands, nor can they stop English workers or \nentrepeneurs from moving in and starting up industries and businesses, the \nCanadian government does.\n\nI never said that you were racist for wanting to reverse those policies, \nyou're racist because you depict a whole ethnicity of this country's \npopulation as having the same character, habits, morals and faults, that's \nracist. It's literally the definition of racism. I can go get the \ndefinition from the Oxford dictionnary if you aren't convinced.\n\nAnd no it's still not racist for me to not feel obligated to conform to \nyour culture. How the hell does that even come close to racism? It would be \nracist for me to judge you and your people as inferior because we have \ndifferent cultural and ethnic backgrounds, something you have repeatedly \ndone to me.\n\nAgain, I'll tell you to practice what you preach. Dont call me racist if \nyou yourself are a racist scumbag, especially if your discriminatory ideals \ncloud your judgement and your ability to reason normally.",

Give all your land back? And where are you gonna \nsend the 35 million people who aren't Native, M\u00e9tis or Inuit? Back to \nEurope where there's no room? There's plenty of space for both of us to \ncoexist here, and we do have as much as a rightful claim to this land as \nyou do. I would understand your outrage if we just started taking over this \nland like 50 years ago, but some of us has been around for over 400 years. \nYou may have been here before us, but now, we're as native as you are to \nthis land, start accepting that as a reality that won't change.\n\nAnd what government that excludes Native participation? There are no laws \nestablished that prohibits a Native, M\u00e9tis or Inuit from taking part of the \ngovernment, you can go to university  and get law and political science \ndegrees like anyone and run for office, except that we have to pay 20 000$ \nof tuitions (in Ontario anyways) each year, and you don't have to pay a \ncent, and you have priority over everyone else when it comes to getting \naccepted in programs. Hell I'm surprised a majority of you aren't doing \nthat right now instead of complaining on the Internet.\n\nAnd yes the Indian Act is gonna take some time to change, because it is a \nwhole set of laws that has to be modified, but it is constantly changing \nand improving for you. Surely someone as educated as you is aware of the \nFirst Nation Acts that have been passed from 1999 to 2006, which opts out a \nlot of the restrictions that were imposed on you by the Indian Act.\n\nAnd French Canadians were put in the same situation as you were in the \nearly 1900s. The R\u00e8glement 17, prohibited us from using our own language \nfor educational purposes, but we fought back and were able to eventually \nreverse the law. We only started opening French schools outside of Quebec \nin the 1980s, and still today we are restricted in resources and in our \nbudget by the government, but it is improving because we're constantly \npressuring the government. Remember that we French Canadians suffered a lot \nof abuse too under the hand of the government. We've been lied to and \ncheated as well. Believe it or not, you're not the sole victim in all this.\n\nAgain my racist laws? I don't recall ever personnaly passing any laws. I \nwasn't even born when the Resadenchal scools were closed down. Oh, and \nbefore you call anybody else racist, at least practice what you preach, and \nyou yourself stop having prejudices of the Canadian white population. \nYou're as contradicting as a member of the KKK calling a member of black \nperson racist.\n\nStop being a hypocrite and start living up to your own code of honor. \nBecause right now, you sure as hell aren't speaking the truth.",
