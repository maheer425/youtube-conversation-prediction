For clarification, I was \nreferring to the majority of them, but not all.\n\nI will try to word this better: Too few physicists are trying to actually \nexplain the mechanisms of the universe. Most of them are satisfied with \nperforming mathematics alone.\n\nI was also trying to give you my own personal opinion on the matter which \nis that it should also be the job of physicists to explain. Being a student \nof mathematics and physics myself, I do not hold the same opinion as the \nmajority. When they say it is the job of ONLY philosophers to explain, they \nare trying to pass their job off to someone else.\n\nMy question to them is this: Why is it that in all other branches of \nscience it is required to explain an event, but in physics it is not?\n\nI understand that maybe you don't even care about my opinion, but I felt \nthe need to give it anyway since it is relevant to your post.",

You were friendly and \ndiscussing kindly, but now there's ignorance in your post all of the sudden.\n\nFirst, you said that *most* physicists don't know philosophy. Then you said *literally \nno one* knows physics and philosophy. Then you said *in general*, \nphysicists don't know philosophy. Now you are saying in capital letters: *NONE \nof them* explain physics and philosophy. Now you are also saying \n*university* physicists don't know philosophy. I can't keep up with this. I \ncan't tell which physicists you're talking about.\n\nSecond, when I said *\"And this does make sense because physics is the study \nof HOW the Universe works, and not the WHY,\"* this is not my 'thought' as \nyou said above. This is the definition of physics. Taken from dictionary.com: \nphysics: *\"the **science** that deals with matter, energy, motion, and \nforce.\"* So when you told me *\"If you think this is so\"*, I can't reply to \nthat because it's not an opinion. I'm talking about physics... not my own \ninterpretation of physics.\n\nThird, you then asked me why I was concerned with \"it just is\" being a lazy \ncop out. This doesn't have to do with my definition of physicists. I'm not \narguing that physicists are at fault. This is a misrepresentation of me \nagain. I'm saying the video is wrong with the statement \"it just is.\" \nWhether the people in the video were physicists or philosophers, the answer \nis still wrong. I didn't say 'physicists need to solve it!' I said the \nstatement is wrong and that is all I said.\n\nThen you said that the physicists I researched who were knowledgeable in \nphilosophy were only the greatest in their field who contributed greatly. \nChris... you don't know who I've researched and who I didn't research. You \nknow each physicists I've researched. So you can't say this my friend. You \ncan't tell me about the physicists I've researched and if they contributed \nin my field. I can tell you, however. But you can not tell me my physicists \nbecause you don't know who they are.\n\nAlso, even if this is true (that the physicists I've researched are only \nthe ones who contributed greatly and were the top physicists), then this \nshows that there do exists physicists that know philosophy, because you \nsaid earlier that *NONE* of the physicists explain the WHY (aka philosophy).\n\nAlso, many of your statements begin with the phrase: \"According to me.\" \nThis doesn't benefit me because, according to them, physicists don't need \nphilosophy (if your statement about them is true). If you have evidence, \nthen that should be posted here. Opinions have little-to-no argument value.\n\nWhether physicists should be required to take philosophy or not is a \ndifferent discussion. I was only saying that they are not allowed to say \n\"it just is\" because that statement is false.",

And the \ntheories which are trying to be passed off as explanations are still not \nexplanations. Once again, this is because they do not understand the \ndifference between the two. They think math explains -- it does NOT.\n\n\"And this does make sense because physics is the study of HOW the Universe \nworks, and not the WHY.\"\n\nIf you think this is so, then why are you saying the statement \"it just is\" \nis a lazy cop-out? If its not the physicists job to tell us why (explain), \nthen they need not be concerned with it.\n\nAccording to ME, they should be asking the WHY questions as well, but they \ndo NOT in modern physics. And this is exactly why we are now in this \ncurrent situation of not understanding the way things work -- just as you \nyourself pointed out earlier.\n\n\"But the more books and articles I read, and the more physicists I research \nwho are not known commonly, the more I see they had knowledge of both.\"\n\nThese are only the ones who were the greatest in their field -- the cutting \nedge guys who contributed to the field greatly. We're talking like a dozen \nguys out of thousands. A degree in physics nowadays requires little to no \nphilosophy whatsoever. According to me, certain philosophy and logic \ncourses should become standard requirement in physics and all of science \nfor that matter. This would prevent us from leading to logical \ncontradictions like \"beginning of time\", Copenhagen Interpretation, etc.\n\nContrary to popular belief, there is not one \"mainstream\" physicist who can \nexplain how a magnet works, or how gravity works, or light, or anything for \nthat matter.\n\nAnyone arguing in favor of the currently proposed theories (i.e. \nRelativity, Higgs Field, Newtonian, etc.) does not understand that they \ndon't explain anything -- they describe.

By saying both can happen, \nsuch a person is now shutting off their logic and is now willing to accept \nanything ever. If we accept that something can be moving and not moving at \nthe same time, than what is stopping us from illogical claims, such as one \nclaiming they drew a 4-sided triangle? This is not logical and we reject \nsuch a claim.\n\nEven if this results in the multiverse mentioned above, there's still \nproblems here:\n\n2. Saying a multiverse is the solution is running away as this is never \nprovable. It's not the only solution to the problem in the video... so why \ndo we jump to that conclusion and not any other answer, such as saying \nthere was a reason for its existence? We should use common sense and say \nthat contradictions do not exist in the Universe, and such a case cannot \nexist. Something cannot be dead and alive at the same time. Saying a \nmultiverse is something not provable, so the one making the claim is not \ncertain of his answer and should be questioned as to why they chose that \nanswer over any other answer.\n\n3. Even if the solution is a multiverse, this still gives us more questions \nthan answers. Like, if a cat was alive and dead at the same time, and you \nsaw the dead cat in this Universe we are in right now, then this brings the \nquestion again... why do you see a dead cat in this Universe and not the \nlive one?

We just call things that can pull each other without \nconnections \"magnets\". Everything with weight pulls everything else a \nlittle bit - you only notice it with things that are as heavy as a planet: \nThat is called \"gravity\". Magnets can pull noticeably when they are small \nlike a pinhead.)\n\nI'm not saying the video isn't true or interesting.\n\nWhy do children ask why the sky is blue but not why tomatoes are red?\ufeff",

But seriously though, if quantum physics allows a particle to \nshare 2 spatial references at the same time, and carry them in verbatim for \nlong astronomical distances, what is stopping a yet unforeseen particle \nfrom amassing as the wave or chain to pass through a nucleus in a \nsubduction cascade from polarization in a chain reaction causing the now \nmarked particles to react more dominantly to that particular nucleus or \nnuclei. Oh man I am talking out of my ass bad here and it shows! Such a \nhypocrite I am.\n\nOkay I'll watch this video... it better not have links to Veritasium, I \nhate those guys.\n\n-edit\nOHGODAMMIT!\ufeff",
