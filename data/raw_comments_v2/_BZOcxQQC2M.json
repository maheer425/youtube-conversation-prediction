            "text": "It is just crazy that you have to pay $60,000 for a sports car  ! Who the \nHell can afford that ? who buys these cars except someone who makes \n$100,000 or more a year not your average Joe on the low wages today . No \nwonder young people have no interest in sports cars today or even older \nadults they just are not affordable not even at $35,000 too much money for \nthese cars . The price makes it a no fun car ,you are either rich or stupid \nto pay this much for a car unless you enjoy being in debt for 5 years or \nmore. I say the Hell with the Hellcat , I can get a nice restored 1960s car \nfor under $18,000 or so. I do not need the speed or tickets either like \nthis car, A waste of money in my opinion . Gone are the value of the dollar \nand 1960s muscle cars .Dodge motor company Thinks everyone makes big \ndollars do they look at the current economy ? though people buy this car I \nam amazed . I guess I am the only one not making a six figure income.\ufeff",
