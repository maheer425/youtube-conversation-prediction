Like in many native american \nlanguages you can't say \"hand\", you can only say, \"my hand\" or \"her hand\" \nor at best \"somebody's hand\", the idea of a hand is inseparable from it's \nownership. Or there  might be one word for 'palm' and one for 'fist' but \nnone for 'hand', and so on. Plus any response you get could be wrapped up \nin all kinds of unexpected grammar. Look up 'foot' in a Welsh dictionary \nand you'll get \"troed\" but point to someone's foot and they might well \nanswer \"'nhroed i\" 'my foot'. And of course there are the stories (probably \nsome of them true) about names on the map where the explorer asks \"what do \ncall that mountain?\" and the native mutters in his own language the \nequivalent of \"buggered if I know\" and that gets written down. Actually I \nknow one genuine case. The largest primate of Madagascar is called the \nIndri, to science it's Indri indri indri, or the family Indrididae etc. \nWell it seems when an early explorer was travelling through the Eastern \ncoastal rainforest, this spectacular creature came bounding through the \ncanopy above (as they do) and all the natives shouted \"Indro izy!\" which \nmeans 'look at that!' but was misinterpreted as \"That's an Indri\".

In Japanese, I've done the same for a couple friends.  The same \ncan be said for not practicing what you learn at frequently enough or, \nespecially, in real conversation (I'll admit I have that latter problem). \n Just look at online national language test records if they ask the \ntest-takers for the amount of time spent in the language.
