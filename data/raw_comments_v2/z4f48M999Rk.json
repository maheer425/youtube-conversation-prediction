            "text": "it just means you're nervous there's a difference between how a liar and a \nnervous person reacts, and even a lying nervous person. Micro-expressions \nare just ques that tell us someone is thinking of something, and are most \noften generalized with lying because that's what we're looking for. When \nyou ask a person a question they're likely to do one if not all these \nthings: Look away to the side usually to their bottom right or to your \nbottom left and also rub their hands or touch their face, depending on how \npersonal the question is they may be guarded and you can tell if they \neither fold their arms or put their hands in their pockets, and if they're \nsitting they cross their legs. If they look to their bottom left or your \nbottom right they are probably trying to make something up and often times \nwill shrug their shoulders with their hands in their pocket, most often \nthey're making something up if they don't tell you right away they don't \nknow. A socially awkward, nervous liar believe it or not can be quite calm \nwhen they lie as since they try over compensate for their nervousness, but \nthat causes them a lot of stress, if you strike right away with the forward \nquestion that they are going to lie about they will look you in the eyes \nwith a furrowed brow and answer hostilely, if you take your time and ask \nsimple small questions the hostility won't be great but after a few it will \nbe obvious of their growing hostility, their edge of their lip will rise \nupwards in animosity for a brief moment and then they'll start to break \ndown and answer hastily and hostilely, and after answering as few questions \nas they seem fit they will try to leave the conversation right away and any \nmore question asking after they want to leave they'll take as harassment \nyou should by that point figure something is up. Also a good thing about \nMicro-expressions is that the person doing it doesn't realize they're doing \nit, I've garnered much success and failure in this art with experimentation \nor \"field study\", if you're not a Sadistic person you start to feel guilty \nbeing able to read people, even sad that people are so easily read, which \nwill makes you feel distrustful of yourself, don't go into this thing \nhaphazardly you'll only hurt yourself and without proper knowledge start to \nfeel paranoid of the gazes of people. You'll learn general stuff about this \nin your year one psych class in college.",
