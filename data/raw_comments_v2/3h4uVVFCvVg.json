They all serve and obey a queen and the honey \nmaking process is super complex, too. My question is how do they know how \nto do and behave accordingly? Are they taught, like humans, how to \nintegrate into society? If so, who teaches them? If not, how else would \nthey just instantly know what to do and how to do it? I understand that the \nqueen uses pheromones to control her hive but that still leaved the \nquestion of how the queen even knows she's a queen. How does she know how \nto lead a hive and so on?\nThat was more than one question, but as you can see, this video just \nsparked my interest in honey bees. Thanks for that!\ufeff",
