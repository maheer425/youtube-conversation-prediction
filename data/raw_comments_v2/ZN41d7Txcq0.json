            "text": "+Ben Miller Hello Ben, Highschool Music Teacher here. To answer your \nquestions in order:1/1 is mathematically the same as 4/4, but they have a \ndifferent rhythmic feel. 1/1 would have one strong beat and three weak \nbeats, (S w w w) and would generally be played a lot faster than 4/4. It \nshould also be noted that 1/1 rarely, and I mean RARELY exists. 4/4 on the \nother hand has two strong and two weak beats (S w S w), and is THE most \ncommon time signature. \n\nAs for you second question, 2/2, 4/2, and even 6/2 exist, but are rarer in \nmusic after ~1850. anything with 2/# will have a march-like feel to it (two \nfeet, and two beats, often used with marching bands). Anything with #/8 \n(almost always 6/8) will have two main beats that are divided into three \npulses (S w w S w w). This can be heard in the Pirates of The Caribbean \ntheme song, as well as in popular songs like 'Say Something' by A Great Big \nWorld. \n\nWe use notes other than a quarter note (crochet in UK) as the beat unit \nmainly to organize the music in easier ways to read. Since eighth notes \n(quavers) can be joined by a stem, time signatures like 6/8 are much more \ncommon than 6/4, simply because we can group those two main beats \n(remember, S w w S w w) into three joined eighth notes a piece. Our brains \nlike reading this better than six 'loose' quarter notes. This is a \nsimplification, but I think it gets the point across. Im sure google images \ncan illustrate this point if you searched both time signatures. \n\nJust in case you're curious, there are others as well. 12/8 is really a \nfaster 6/8 with twice as long phrases. 3/4 (and 3/2, 3/8) have one strong \nand two weak beats (S w w) and originally were for waltzes and dances. 5/4 \nand 7/8 are irregular times (look up mission impossible theme song (5/4) \nand Money by Pink Floyd (7/8 time signature in the verse). Don't worry \nabout the denominator when listening to these, just try to count the beats \nand see if they add up to 5 and 7 respectively. \nHope this helps! \nMr Lenk",
