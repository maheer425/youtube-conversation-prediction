Ranger seemed to be made \naerodynamically, resistance wouldn't be as enormous as you suggest, and \nwe're talking about the black hole, which as you pointed time and time \nagain has so strong gravitational field that light cannot escape, i don't \nthink he'd have enoguh time to lose all his speed if he was going in fast \nenough. I haven't seen precise calculations, but possibility is enough to \nsuspend my disbelief.\n2) Even if plants didn't use oxygen to brieve as you suggest it would have \nbeen mistake on my side, not a paradox. But i assure you it's not a \nmistake. Plants use carbon dioxyde for photosynthesis, not breathing. and \nbyproduct of this is oxygen but plants still use oxygen to breathe. When \nthere is no sunlight, and photosynthesis is impossible, the plants breathe \noxygen just like any other living thing, and even when there is sunlight \nplants still breathe oxygen, but globally the oxygen created from \nphotosynthesis is much grater than the one plant uses to breathe. Just a \nlittle biology lesson for you.\nBack to the topic what is the actuall paradox you keep pointing out? You \nkeep pointing at the loop and calling it paradox. We used the wormhole to \nsurvive, then after huge ammount of time we mastered gravity, and \n5-dimentional space alowing us to create the wormhole, what ensured our \nsurvival. You're not saying that there is something wrong with the \nequation, you're saying that the equation shouldn't be there to begin with. \nI say that as long as all elements of the equation are present it still \nstands. You don't know how actual time-travel would work, so you cannot \nclaim that this one is wrong until you poit out definite flaw or \ncontradiction. This movie assumes that time travel was part of timeline to \nbegin with, and that's one possibility. I've seen several paradoxes \ninvolving time travel, but while it comes close to onthological paradox, \nwhen object or information exist because of time travel, without being \ncreated it comes only as far as close.",

Is that a \nparadox?\" well YES, it's a paradox, because plants DO NOT use oxygen to \nbreathe, but carbon dioxide (co2). oxygen is a side product of the \nreaction, like co2 is for us.\nthere is no way you can explain how 1+1=2 but 2<> 1+1, because it is simply \nimpossible. it's a plot hole, pure and simple.",

And unlike you i remember \nthem saying that this is gentle singularity, which means that tidal forces \nnear event horizon are weaker than normal making slipping into hole \npossible, sure it was rough like hell, but not impossible. This was \nexplained in the movie, and as far as my understanding of physics go, it \nwasn't wrong. and like i mentioned, what happesn AFTER getting through \nevent horizon is speculative. Physics we knew 300 years ago goes out of the \nwindow with speed close to light speed, it's not impossible that physics we \nknow today goes out of the window when gravity is so strong that even light \ncan escape. No means of checking it, therefore it's open to speculation.\nAs i already mentioned spaceships do not stop or lose speed when they run \nout of fuel. He sped up the Endurance when ranger was still attached, so \nboth ranger and endurance had the same speed, and like you said ranger \ndetached AFTER speeding up endurance. Lack of fuel adds nothing to the \nequation, because he had speed already.\nPlants use oxygen to brieve, but without plants there is no oxygen, because \nplants create oxygen as well. Is that a paradox? No. As long as both sides \nof the equation are present, everything is fine. Humans transcending would \nbe impossible without wormhole, so they created wormhole in order to be \nable to transcend. If the wormhole was already there, allowed humans to \ntranscend, and then future humans from the future destroyed the wormhole in \nthe past that would be paradox, because without the wormhole, they would be \nunable to transcend to destroy it. But since both wormhole and future \nhumans exist at certain points of time the timeline is sustained. You are \nthinking of seperate timelines, when one timeline must exist before the \ntime travel and time travel can alter other timelines, but that one \npossible scenario of time travel, the other when time travel was part of a \ntimeline from the begginning, is what i called closed time loop, and that \nscenario was used in the movie. No confirmed real-life time travel happened \nso far, so we cannot know for sure how it exacly works.",
