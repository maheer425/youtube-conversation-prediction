Please explain to me how a 600 HP car (at \nthe crank) manages to have 93.34% efficiency delivering hp to to the wheels \n(claimed 560 WHP at the end of the video). No such car exists that can do \nthat, obviously his claims about the car being 600 HP are NOT correct, it's \nprobably closer to 659 HP at the crank (85% efficiency average). And before \nsomebody comes to tell me that they're simply rounding up 560whp and \ncalling it 600 Hp (which is probably what they're doing) that is still \ngiving out stupidly inaccurate data. WHP and HP are inherently different, \nhence why one specify at the wheels, do a better job and learn to specify \nwhat you are talking about to not give out these misguided claims\ufeff",
