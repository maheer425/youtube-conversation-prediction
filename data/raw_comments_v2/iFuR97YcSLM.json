That as One goes \nfurther expanding Ulam's Spiral ever outward to vast distances in all \ndirections: that each Equation's fragment though still containing only a \nlimited number of Primes: nevertheless approaches infinity if Ulam's Siral \nis extended far enough out, but that It Does nevertheless increase that \nlimited number of Primes, but never reaches  it for each and every equation \nout there From Here To Infinity? Or that on the average for all equations: \nonly a CERTAIN MINIMUM AND CERTAIN MAXIMUM  is attainable for how many \nprimes for each line segment, each formula?  Is the minimum AT LEAST 2 \nPrimes? or some higher number like 100? According to Euclid, only 2 points \nare needed to establish a line: must every line fragment in Ulam's Spiral \ngive out at least 2 primes? But that some line way out there in Ulam's \nextended Spiral a certain Diagonal will give out 100 Primes but no more? \nThen another line, say, 2 light years away in actual further extension of \nthe actual Ulam Spiral on this Video will then give 1000 Primes but no \nmore?
