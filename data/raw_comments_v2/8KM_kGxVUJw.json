I watch Comedy Central \nto laugh, not watching someone say \"keep it one hundred\" 15 times. \n\nI liked when Steven was actually using his satirical gift to make fun of \nthe more serious topics, like Jon does. Even though I don't think Jon's \nreplacement will be like Larry [I hope not..], I still think Jon Oliver \nshould of taken over. He is well known and actually makes me laugh. Trevor \nNoah was only introduced around a couple years ago, and now he is taking \nover this show. I'll still watch it but I am hoping he doesn't let me down \nlike Wilmore..\ufeff",
