If we look back to the beginning, we see that \nthe real division within the American Colonies wasn't black and white, but \nrich and poor. And it's no different today. But, I guess it's just human \nnature to find somebody to look down on, when you're getting shit on. The \nfact is, that while blacks were being imported as slaves, whites were \ncoming to the colonies as indentured servants. Probably 75% of whites who \narrived, came as indentured servants. And, as bad as the black slaves lives \nwere which was really shitty and made worse by the knowledge they had no \nway out, the white indentured servants were often treated worse. The \nmajority didn't survive to claim their freedom. Why? Because, they were \ncheap compared to the black slave, who was an asset to be preserved. Also, \nthey cost the master money for the payments required at the end of service. \nSo, if they didn't survive, well, there was always more where they came \nfrom.  Logic might suggest that those at the bottom of the food chain would \nfind common cause. Unfortunately, those same indentured servants forgot \ntheir mistreatment at the hands of the wealthy and their common cause with \nblacks,and in the South chose to fight for states rights during the Civil \nWar, even though they rarely owned slaves themselves. Their descendents \nwere the victims of labor violence in Ford Motor Company, Carnegie Steel, \nand Peabody Coal, just to mention a few. But I guess when the ruling elites \nconsider you disposable fodder for their money mills, and you become hill \nbillies, red necks, poor white trash, shanty Irish, and any other \nderogatory term they chose to use, then finding some other group even lower \ndown the totem pole makes your own situation a bit more bearable. So, now \nwe have the ruling elites on top, and the rest of us disenfranchised \nwhites, blacks, browns and yellows expending all our energies against each \nother while the rich and powerful continue to look down their noses at us \nand laugh all the way to the bank..\ufeff",

Who is the most prominent Black Republican in office?  I guess \nJustice Clarence Thomas, do you think they see him as a slave? \n\n-There are Republican who actually think Blacks would be BETTER OF AS \nSLAVES... that's not a party that Blacks could support unless they don't \ncare that so many in the party have a visceral distaste toward our \nethnicity.  I've never heard a liberal say that slavery was a blessing in \ndisguise, or that segregation was great, or interracial dating is wrong, or \nblacks bring down educational standards... I'm an Independent, social \nlibertarian, military member.  As such I agree with a portion of the \nRepublican platform, but if I had to pick a political party, it would be \nthe one that doesn't have members who talk like they hate me... that's just \ncommon sense.",
