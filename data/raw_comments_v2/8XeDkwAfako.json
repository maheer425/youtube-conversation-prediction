Nguyen i guess in a way, a good amount of people speak english in \ntaipei, places like metro station counters/info desk, major attractions \nlike the national palace museum and taipei 101. so yeah, basically most of \nthe major, most well known areas of taipei speak english, except a few like \nwhen you go to Shilin night market, that place is a more local attraction \nwhich is why people dont really speak english there even though its \nbecoming a very big tourist attraction. hope this helps you a little :D",
