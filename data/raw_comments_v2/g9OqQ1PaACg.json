The air and the water will recover, the \nearth will be renewed.\nAnd if it\u2019s true that plastic is not degradable, well, the planet will \nsimply incorporate plastic into a new paradigm: the earth plus plastic.\nThe earth doesn\u2019t share our prejudice toward plastic. Plastic came out of \nthe earth.\nThe earth probably sees plastic as just another one of its children.\nCould be the only reason the earth allowed us to be spawned from it in the \nfirst place.\nIt wanted plastic for itself. Didn\u2019t know how to make it. Needed us.\nCould be the answer to our age-old egocentric philosophical question, \u201cWhy \nare we here?\u201d\"\ufeff",
