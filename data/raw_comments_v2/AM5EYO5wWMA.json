Technically, the goings-on of the \nscene is incredibly minimal - in the world of the movie, not much is \nhappening. The same kind of goes for films like Jaws and Halloween - just a \ncouple of characters in a relatively confined area trying to solve a \nsingle, direct problem. And yet, the tension is unbearable and the payoff \nis spectacular. It's really a technique that isn't heavily utilized anymore \nin the bigger-scale films made nowadays, and it goes to show that when it \ncomes to good storytelling, character development wins out over effects \nwork every single time.\ufeff",
