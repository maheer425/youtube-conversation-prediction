Some \ntanks have even gone as fast as 60 to 70 miles per hour for short periods \nof time.

The sign in Santa Cruz is a perfect example of how \nextremely rude many beach goers are.  They have to be told, like little \nchildren, how to behave in public so as to not be too loud, obnoxious, \nannoying, irritating, intrusive and etc., etc., around other people trying \nto relax and enjoy the weather, the water, and the view.  Litter is another \nhuge problem left behind by these jerks. (I already have several horrid \nyoung neighborhood families that act like teenagers living away from home \nfor the first time.  The parents and their kids all act like spoiled brats \ntaking over and trashing the neighborhood, like 1830's MO.religion wars, \nsee Gov. Boggs executive order 44.  We don't want people like that ruining \nour neighborhoods or beaches.) There have been many times when many of us \non the beach wished that there were more sings like this that were enforced \nto keep rude idiots off the beach.  Who wants to get hit by a stray \nbaseball or other flying objects while  minding their own business on the \nbeach? Maybe you do, but no one else does.  There are still many sports and \nbeach party activities allowed there. \nAlso, I believe, women are allowed to go topless which I have seen many \ntimes there.  So, if this beach is too boring for you, especially if you \ndon't like girls, cause there's thousands of them all over the place there, \nthen go somewhere else where you can be rude and annoying to yourself. That \nworks doesn't it? Cause it sounds like you want the right to be rude \nanywhere and at anytime you want, and that nobody else has any rights at \nall to be free from it.  IF PEOPLE WOULD LEARN & PRACTICE COMMON COURTESY, \nTHERE WOULDN'T NEED TO BE SOO MANNY SIGNS, RIGHT?\ufeff",
