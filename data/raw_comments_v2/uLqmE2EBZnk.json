I just wanted to \nshare with you something in my school we had career day were everyone picks \na job so I picked a material scientist and I did a demonstration and guess \nwhat I did I did the acetone in the wig head with a cup in it and wrote the \nscientific method steps and presented it kind of like you and don't worry I \nsaid to everyone yah steve spangler is the one who has taught me all this \nand I told all of them to go check you out online and on YouTube. You are \nthe most creative cool kindhearted person so thank you so much for always \nliving by your motto MAKE IT BUG DO IT RIGHT GIVE IT CLASS P.S. I always \nuse that motto yah and another thing is we are having science fair and its \ncoming up pretty soon I was wondering if you can send me an email to an \naddress that I can give you and maybe you can give me some ideas bc I can't \npick there are WAYYY TO MANY CHOICES AGAIN THANSK YOU SOOOOO MUCH \nSincerely, Adina.
