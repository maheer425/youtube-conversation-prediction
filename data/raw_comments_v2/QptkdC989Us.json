Various sources \nclaimed something around $25 millions for BB and $30 millions for Psy. \nDespite thas, YG income in 2012 was not even half of SMEnt one, and this \nmade me think that, considering that both Psy and BB have been around the \nshowbiz for very long time, their \"sharing profit tax\" with the label is \nactually lower than an average KPop Idol. Thi because of all the side \nincomes a part from the musical productions one. Action, modeling, advs, \ncommercials etc. all stuff where the label earning is moderate. Therefore, \nYG was not earning a big part of those incomes. And in 2012 out of Psy and \nBB, YG roster was not really profitable unlike the SMEnt one. Same happened \nwith Rain who, before being enlisted, was ranked #1 richest Korean Star but \nhis label (JTune for the pros, JYP for all of us normal folks LOL) income \nwas not even half of his personal one.  Mixed sources so handle with care \neven though we can surely say that GD and his pals are tremendously rich \nnowadays :D And that Kpop idols usually get richer in time.
