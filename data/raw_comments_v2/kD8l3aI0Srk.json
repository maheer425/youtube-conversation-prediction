For one, those charities \nreceive rather substantial donations throughout the year, and many have \nschool groups, and private fundraisers. The P4A allows the lesser known \ncharities to receive donations. However, I think that instead of the three \ncharities on the first day to be per-determined, the candidates are \npredetermined, and we vote for those, as well.\ufeff",

In other words-to tell us what \nwe are voting for. We want to know our money is going to an amazing place, \nand under the previous formatting, we were allowed to make these kinds of \ndecisions, although they were, perhaps, occasionally railroaded by popular \nvoting rather than educated voting.  And while I trust you, I don't trust \nmany big charities.  So, for example, Save the Children or Water.org have \noften received a part of the pie through Nerfighteria's voting system.  I'd \nbe willing to bend for them. But, someone like the Komen fund, not so much.\n\nHowever, I'm also worried that because of the donations to the big \ncharities, the little charities will not receive as much.  The big \ncharities have big marketing campaigns that bring in money year round, and \nthe matching companies are going to match other people and perhaps the same \ncharities, but the little charities don't have these kinds of machines to \nbring the money in. For many, this is their big chance to make a difference \nfor the year.  I'd hate to see that chance dwindle.\n\nI'm sorry if my thoughts are a bit messy.  I'm very tired, and maybe sick, \nbut those are my personal worries.\ufeff",

            "text": "I've actually been thinking about this a lot lately. I didn't really want \nto post anything until I had sorted out my thoughts more, so sorry this \ncomment is a little bit late. I've been participating in the P4A since \n2007. I have seen it change and grow over the years in many amazing ways.\nI do agree that spamming via comments no longer actually works, which makes \nme so sad. I think meaningful conversations sound like a nice idea, and I \nmight add in that it may be a good idea to hijack other social media sites \n(twitter, facebook, whatever else people use these days) because I feel \nlike spreading awareness about charities is a core part of the P4A.\nInitially I was a little unsure about donating to the 3 big charities the \nfirst day, but after considering it and reading some of the other comments \nI have somewhat come around to the idea. I think it is okay to involve big \ncharities, as it will allow for more donations going to good charities and \nthus doing more good. The P4A has always been different in that it really \nsupports the underdogs and often gives money to charities who wouldn't \nnormally get big donations. I don't want that part to change. I guess I \nwonder if the large corporations wouldn't donate to these charities anyway, \nand does making that a part of the P4A actually make a difference in how \nmuch money is being donated?\nHonestly, the biggest problem I am still having has to do more with the \nfact that we are allocating all of the first days funds to bigger \ncharities. Most donations come in on the first day, and some people won't \nwant to donate to bigger charities. Now, lots of people will just say \"well \nthen save your money and donate the second day\" which sounds perfectly \nreasonable... except when you add in the perks (I am assuming you are still \nplanning to have perks for donations?). Lots of the perks are limited and \nmay go fast. Let's consider a hypothetical situation where a person wants \nto donate to smaller charities so they plan to wait until day 2, but a perk \ncomes up on day 1 that they want and if they wait until day 2 it'll \nprobably be gone. This person is left to choose between a perk they are \ninterested in and where they want their money to go. I'm not sure if there \nis a good way to work around that. I suppose you could not have perks the \nfirst day, but that would probably result in significantly fewer day 1 \ndonations. Possibly there might be a way to allow people donating for perks \nto decide if they want their money to go to the first or second day fund \n(like a pending donation?). Or this just might have to be a decision people \nhave to make.\nSo yea, those are my general thoughts about this. Thanks for reading :)\ufeff",

            "text": "So, in preparation for my comment I went back and watched videos about the \n2007 Power Project for Awesome. In his 2007 video, Hank describes PP4A as \nawesome because every Nerdfighter involved was promoting a charity of their \nchoice that they believed reduced the amount of suck in the world. The goal \nback then was to fill youtube with the things that we care about and raise \nsome money in the process. And I think that\u2019s where my problem with this \nplan comes in.\n\nJohn\u2019s suggestion to spend a day raising money for three pre-determined \ncharities is valuable, but I think the thing that makes me feel weird about \nit is that at that point it ceases to be P4A and starts being just a \nfundraiser. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with a fundraiser!! But that\u2019s \nsomething we can do any ol\u2019 time of the year.\n\nThe way I\u2019ve always understood it, P4A is about individuals digging deep to \ndetermine what charities they want to share with Nerdfighteria in order to \nraise awareness and invite each other to reduce world suck. It\u2019s about \nhaving important discussions about the value of charity and educating one \nanother about the problems plaguing our world today. During P4A, the \ncommunity chooses who deserves contributions based on the quality of the \ncharities and the qualities of the videos being made. Having a focus on \nthree pre-determined charities makes it less democratic and implies that \nthe international charities that might be chosen are inherently more \nvaluable and worthy of donations than any charity a Nerdfighter might want \nto talk about during P4A. And that\u2019s just not right.\n\nFinally, I just want to say: I know that matching donations are exciting \nand valuable, but Nerdfighteria is too powerful to discount simply because \nit's hard to match general fundraising with grants that usually call for \nspecific things. Call us to do something amazing this year and we will rise \nto the occasion. Expect us to donate little, and we will happily donate \nlittle. Expect us to donate much, and we will fight to the gritty end until \nwe have come out victorious. But in order to unlock our potential, you have \nto believe in us first.\ufeff",

(This is also a \nthing many nerdfighters already do outside the community) But P4A is about \nsupporting smaller charities handpicked by nerdfighters.  Getting large \nsums of \"matching money from wealthy private donors\" seems like a great \nidea but many of these people have a chosen amount of money that they will \ndonate to a charity regardless of the P4A. I really think that our focus \nshouldn't be on drastically increasing the amount of money we raise, \nhonestly the money has been doing that on its own pretty well for the last \nseven or so years of the P4A. We should instead place it on helping smaller \ncharities in need of support with causes we agree with. I'm open to being \nwrong though.\ufeff",

I am concerned about the \nweighting of day one versus day two, but I know the team will space out \nperks and so on so that the majority of the money doesn't come on the first \nday. I'm sure whatever charities are selected for the first day will be \ngreat ones since presumably you all will be doing that choosing? (Or will \nwe vote on that somehow ahead of time?) Thanks for starting this \nconversation.\ufeff",

            "text": "Having three predetermined charities is understandable, I do have one \nquestion, though. And this is less about the splitting of funds from the \ntwo days and more about the charity themselves; why can we only promote a \ncharity during P4A and not a specific project said charities have? Ex: I \nknow most people are familiar with UNICEF, and it is a great (and pretty \n\"excellent and efficient\") charity, however UNICEF has had several projects \nover the years that are specific in what cause they help, like the \nEliminate Project (which aims to eliminate maternal and neonatal tetanus \n(MNT)) or The Six Cents Initiative (aiming to bring clean water in \ndeveloping countries). Both are great causes, but donating to UNICEF itself \nsplits the funds one might donate to them between their individual projects \nas well as just administrative costs. However, if you donate to the \nspecific project you are donating to that cause alone, and you then know \nwhere your money is going and if it is going to the cause you wish to \nsupport. Would it not be more understandable to have P4A not only promote \ncharities but also their projects? I don't know if there is a reason that \nP4A is just for the charities and not the projects, if there is please tell \nme! Thank you. \ufeff",
