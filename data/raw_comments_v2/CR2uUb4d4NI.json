I mean the VXR came last because he expected it to be dreadful \ncompared to the previous model! Huh! He has proven it to be better around \nthe track coming No.1 without the VXR mode on.  Then he says Megan is the \none to take to the track.  VXR is better looking of the 3 but as everyday \ndrive Ford takes the lead. So this test just highlighted that VXR and Megan \nare neck to neck.  True hot hatches ready for the track and lack a bit when \ncomes to everyday drive but good enough.  Ford is your everyday drive kinda \nhot hatch but not hot enough for the track.  So it tries to give you the \nbest of both world but it doesn't.  It doesn't even stand out but reminds \none that word ugly exists.\ufeff",

The Abarth straight from the factory though easy to \nfix had many things I disliked but I loved the looks it got and the wow \nfactor once upgraded how fast it seemed.  The ford is much faster but feels \nmuch less zippy than the Abarth.  I know why am Im comparing these 2 cars \nwell my Abarth cost me 28K the Focus ST3 26K much better value the fit n \nfinish much better the recardo seat are the real deal unlike the Abarths \nunfinished leather seat.  On a tight road I would give it to the upgraded \nAbarth but for everything else the ST has it in every other situation.
