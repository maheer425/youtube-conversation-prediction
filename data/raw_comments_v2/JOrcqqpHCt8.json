I'm 17 years old, and about a year \nago I came across this video by chance whilst on YouTube, and at that point \nI knew nothing about the church and the gospel at all... I come from an \natheist household were religion just was not part of our lives, but when I \ncame across this video I had so many questions and an urge from the depths \nof my heart to learn... Unfortunately due to my mothers beliefs I cannot \nattend church or be taught by missionaries until I leave home when I'm 18 \nin August, and this breaks my heart, but this has not stopped me. I try to \nlearn and live to the best of my ability through the gospel and our Saviour \nJesus Christ and I pray to our Heavenly Father to guide me and help me to \ngrow into the young women I hope to become and I pray for patience and \nstrength over the coming months. I know that I am a child and daughter of \nGod.. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. \u2764\ufeff",

            "text": "I came here from the shaytards channel , i didnt know about mormon until i \nsaw their channel! I have christian parent and we go to church at \nchristmas  and rememberance day - i go with school at easter and christmas. \nBut i dont know how i think of it. I feel i offended my music teacher once \nwhen I said I didnt beilive in it and I didnt like a certain church to a \nfriend one which hw was a leader of - I feel so bad about it and i always \nthink og how bad i was. I dont think i belive the jesus story about god \nmaking Mary pregnant , I he was joseph and marys son but was told to have \nhim was maybe when she became pregnent God decided this child shall be my \nspeaker for example. But i do believe in God i think although I tell \neveryone i dont probably because of how i see the jesus story. But I \nbelieve in evolution and the big bang. So although I am kind of christian \nim not. I love this song as it holds my beilfs - I am a child of god as am \none of his people in his planet that he sees or watches over but im my \nparents child more than his. But im not sure where im going with this \ncomment but its nice to maybe tell someone. and if you got to here then \nwhats baptisim?\ufeff",
