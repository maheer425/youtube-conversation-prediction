Follow me here - \n\nThe force of gravity is stronger the closer you are to the source of \ngravity. \n\nWhen you are standing on the surface of the Earth, if you want to escape \nwithout further propulsion, you would need an instantaneous velocity of \nabout 11.2 km/s to escape (this ignores drag). The escape velocity would be \nbigger if the Earth were more dense. If you made the Earth just a little \nbit smaller, but kept the mass the same, you would be CLOSER to the same \namount of mass, therefore the gravity would be stronger, and the \ninstantaneous velocity required to escape the Earth would be larger. Say 50 \nkm/s. What if you made the Earth even smaller - still keeping the mass the \nsame? The escape velocity would get even bigger. \n\nSo, the question is, how small would you have to compress all the mass of \nthe Earth to where the escape velocity from the surface was equal to the \nspeed of light (300,000 km/s)? The answer to that question is the \nSchwarzchild radius. And it's about the size of a peanut for the Earth.\n\nIf an object is SMALLER than its schwarzchild radius, then obviously, from \nthe 'surface' of that object, you would have to be going faster than the \nspeed of light to escape - ergo, you have yourself a black hole.",
