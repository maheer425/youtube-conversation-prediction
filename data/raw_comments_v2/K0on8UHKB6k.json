            "text": "When Justice Roberts asked the proponents of same-sex marriage if four \nlawyers could marry they replied \"that is not what marriage is.\"  How did \nthey come to that conclusion?  What is marriage?\nJesus says in reference to being challenged about divorce, if it was \nlegal(?), and the adversary knew it was legal, \"From the beginning God made \nthem male and female for each other.  Thus a young man shall leave his \nfather and mother and cleave to his wife.  And the two shall become one \nflesh.  What God has joined together let not anyone put asunder.\"  (Mark \n10.7)\nSame-sex marriage is going to be the law of the land, no doubt.  But let's \nbe consistent.   If you advocate same-sex marriage you are certainly not \nfollowing the definition of marriage that Jesus gives. \nI would ask, as it was brought up in the movie Philadelphia, if sodomy is \nthe same moral equivalent as natural sexual intercourse?  Now don't get \nbent out of shape.  But isn't that suggested by saying that same-sex \nmarriage is equivalent with traditional marriage?   As Washington said in \nthe movie, \"Explain it to me like I was a child.\"  Because that is what we \nwill be telling our children in school sex education that one is just as \nacceptable as the other.  Maybe we can even encourage them to try both and \nsee which they like the best.\ufeff",

Homosexuals don't have the right to marry. \nMarriage is a biblical institution. Your comment about discriminating \nagainst straights was truly astounding. Yes, Heterosexuals who are the \nfuture of the human race are the real problem. I know you aren't quite \nbright enough to get this but Homosexuals can't pro-create. You see \"mother \nnature\" seems to have selected them for extinction if you believe in that \nwhole Evilution \"survival of the fittest\" thing. Which you would have to if \nyou've denied what God and Jesus said about Marriage and the abomination \nthat is Homosexuality. If Evilution was indeed true then no trait which \ngenetically excludes someone from pro-creation could survive evilution(if \nit were indeed a genetic trait WHICH IT IS NOT, IT IS A CHOICE!!!!!) So \neither Homosexuals would have had to adapt Homosexuals genitalia which \nwould allow them to pro-create through Homo sexual \"sex\" or they would have \nbeen completely wiped from the gene pool if natural selection was indeed \ntrue. I know that all Christians are stupid and can't think for themselves \nand are \"hateful\" too but maybe you should think about that for a second. \nStraight people are so last year. They think they're so awesome just \nbecause they are the only way for the human race to continue. HOMOSEXUALITY \nIS A CHOICE JUST LIKE ANY OTHER SIN!!!! I KNOW EVILUTION WASN'T ABLE TO \nOVERCOME THE CHOICE OF HOMOSEXUALITY BUT YOU CAN WITH JUST A LITTLE SOCIAL \nJUSTICE RIGHT!!! THE LEFT, INVENTING VICTIMS FOR THE LAST 100 YEARS!!!!!!!\ufeff",

In pressing their \u201ccreation order\u201d argument, some Christians \nare fond of saying, \"God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve!\" To bolster \ntheir position, they often cite Jesus\u2019 words in Matthew 19:4-5, where he \nresponds to a question about whether divorce is permissible:\n\n\u201cJesus answered, \u2018Have you not read that the One who made them at the \nbeginning made them male and female, and said, \u201cFor this reason a man shall \nleave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two shall \nbecome one flesh\u201d? Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one \nseparate.\u2019 \u201d\n\nFrom these words, some Christians draw the conclusion that heterosexuality \nis the creation norm and, thus, heterosexual marriage is the only \nlegitimate way for people to form romantic relationships. Ironically, \nJesus\u2019 own words in this very same passage refute these conclusions.\n\nAs the dialogue continues, Jesus\u2019 disciples are disturbed by his strict \nteaching on divorce. The disciples say that if divorce is not a ready \noption, perhaps it would be best for a man not to marry a woman. Jesus \nresponds:\n\n\u201cNot everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom it is given. \nFor there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs \nwho have been made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have made \nthemselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept \nthis who can.\u201d (Matthew 19:11-12)\n\nHere Jesus identifies three classes of men who should not marry women. \nTaking his categories in reverse order, first, there are those who have \nmade themselves \u201ceunuchs\u201d for the kingdom of heaven, i.e., those who \nforeswear marriage to better serve God. Second, he mentions those who have \nbeen \u201cmade eunuchs by others,\u201d an apparent reference to castrated males. \nBut Jesus mentions a third category \u2014 eunuchs who were born that way. Some \nmight argue that Jesus was referring to males born without testicles, but \nthis would be extremely rare. Moreover, this interpretation ignores how the \nterm \u201cborn eunuchs\u201d was used in other literature of the time.\n\nIn the ancient world, including ancient Jewish culture (as reflected in the \nTalmud), \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cborn\u201d eunuchs were not associated with missing \ntesticles. Rather, they were associated with stereotypically effeminate \ncharacteristics and behavior (just like modern gay men), and were thought \nby Rabbi Eliezer to be subject to \u201ccure\u201d (just like modern gays). Moreover, \nas we have also seen, eunuchs were commonly associated with homosexual \ndesire. (For a complete discussion of the term \"born eunuch\" and the \nconnection with homosexuality, see The Early Church Welcomed a Gay Man.) As \na reasonably informed person of his time, Jesus would have been aware of \nthis common view of eunuchs. Yet he very matter-of-factly asserts that some \npeople are simply born that way. The implication of his statement is \nprofound \u2014 God created gay people the way they are! Jesus says so.\n\nUnlike Rabbi Eliezer, Jesus feels no need to \u201ccure\u201d these born eunuchs. He \nspeaks no words of condemnation. Rather he lists people born gay alongside \nanother honored class (eunuchs for the kingdom), and accepts them as a \nnatural part of God\u2019s creation order.\n\nThus, when Matthew 19 is read as a whole, we see Jesus teaches that most \npeople are created for heterosexual marriage. (We too accept this as God\u2019s \npredominant creation paradigm.) But, unlike some modern Christians, Jesus \ndoes not see this as the only honorable way to live. He acknowledges that \nsome human beings have been created by God to follow a less common, but \nequally legitimate path. There are some who have been eunuchs from birth \u2014 \nmade that way by God.\ufeff",

Of course, political safeguards have and \nshould be insured to protect minorities against the whims of the majority. \nBut does this automatically entail that we invariably have to espouse \nthe views of the few because it is supposedly the right thing to do? In \nthis regard, as David Letterman would like us to think, we are not talking \nhere about the scourge of slavery where the whip, torture and segregation \nwere the order of the day. We are talking about a rather new \nphenomenon that encroaches on the deep seated values of family life and \nreligion from which this country benefited so much and even bloomed.\n\nI fully realize that those views, all conservative they may sound, might \nnot appeal to the more liberal voices. To abdicate them however, even so \nslightly, would only signify that they always were retrograde and thus all \nthe more disposable.

I can see no valid reason \nwhy gay marraige should be allowed and incest should not be allowed, if gay \nmarraige should be allowed than incest should also be allowed there would \nbe not rational reason why it shouldn't be. Gay marraige shouldn't be \nallowed because gay people are involved in vile behavior involving their \nbuttholes, that has nothing to do with being married. And if they are \nlesbians what they do is pee on each other. and in each others mouths. What \ndoes that have to do with being married? NOthing. Anyway gay people can \nalready get married. A gay guy can  marry a lesbian. So they are nnot being \ntreated any different. They just want special treatment.  Gay people cannot \nhave kids and they should not be allowed to adopt kids and if they do have \nkids their kids should be taken away from them. So why should they need to \nbe married? The only reason marraige exissts is because back before they \nhad dna tests it was illegal to have sex without being married. And that \nwas because women get pregant and the community needed to know which guy \nhad to support the kid and the woman was pregant. So they said you can only \nhave sex if you get married so that way everyon will know who the dad is.  \nGay couples connot have kids so there is no reason for them to get married \nto each other becuase the community does not need to know who the dad is \nbecause there is no dad.",
