He is apparently a major \ncar junkie and great stunt/ race/ cross country driver depending on why he \nwants to be behind the wheel.  He has been known to spontaneously jump into \nhis car drive from Illinois to California and back for no other reason than \nhe just enjoys being behind the wheel of a car. \n\nAlthough the scene before this one where they were driving in the parking \nlot was being done by a stunt driver because the director managed to make a \ndeal with a car company to allow them to fill up the entire parking lot, \nbut the problem was that they were all literally right off manufacturer and \nreleased that same year. So the entire parking lot was filled with top of \nthe line latest models of that year completely unused and they weren't \nallowed to get a single scratch on them. The Director admitted to being \nterrified the entirety of the filming for that scene praying to god that \nthe stunt drivers don't accidentally hit one.",
