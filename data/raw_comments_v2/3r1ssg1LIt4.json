What causes my eyebrow to be raised is that you \ntheorist have a lot of holes in your character, as well.  I\u2019ll tell you \nwhat is truly Satanic. What\u2019s Satanic is illuminati theorist being racist \ntowards Jews and falsely accusing them of being in the illuminati, which is \nwhat you illuminati theorist have done.  Illuminati theorist saying stuff \nlike \u201cI heard Alex Jones wife is in the illuminati\u201d and Alex Jones is a \nsecret government agent. I mean? Really? Alex Jones!? Alex Jones, one the \nmost out spoken illuminati theorist, is now being accused of being in the \nilluminati. The confusion is just rampant and pathetic. One illuminati \ntheorist girl said that God put 4 year old girls in Hell for having bad \nhair. So her whole testimony just went out the window with that one \nstatement.  God does not put little kids in Hell. With out a doubt Alex \nJones has to be demon possessed. You can just see the hatred steaming off \nhis eyes. God said hating is the same as murder and will send you to hell. \nWhile Muslims chant that they are going to take over the world just like it \nwarns about them in the Bible, you guys say nothing. Illuminati is not \nconquering nothing. The Bible indicates that the Anti Christ will come from \nIshmael and rule the world for 7 years.  The demonic Quran says their \nMahadi will rule the world for 7 years. You see the similarities? \nYes,  you do love to accuse people of being in illuminati for the mystery \nand excitement of it all that or you psyched yourself into believing it. \nLikely, both.  Of course your not going to admit that. It\u2019s just like a \ncrazy person would never admit that  he is crazy. ",

The very same Alex Jones that make such \nwild conspiracy theories about the illuminati. Saying stuff like. \"I heard \nAlex Jones  has got a Jew wife and is a secret agent of the illuminati\" I \nmean what the? Let me tell you something. Muslims chant all the time at \ntheir rallies that they want to conquer the world day in and day out and no \none barely says a thing. I caught on to what Satan is trying to do. Motown \n25 is what started his fame. Muslims have already taken over parts of the \nU.K. through intimidation and the freedom of speech of U.K's democracy. \n Quincy Jones had to beg MJ to do Motown 25, because MJ wasn't interested \nin doing it. Humble beginnings that's what it's all about. Like when Moses \none of God's prophets, didn't want to preach, but God gave him the ability \nto preach any way. Just like my pastor Mr. Eric NewBerry after he was \nsaved, God called him to preach, and he didn't want to do it, because he \nthought he couldn't but God gave him the ability. The point is God usually \nblesses humble people usually most of the times and I've notice that it is \nusually people that don't even want the job. ",

If you are in the illuminati, that \nwould make you extremely demon possessed and selfish, yet MJ bared the \nfruit of humble Christian.
