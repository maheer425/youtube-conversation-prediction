I live in a fairly small town, so I figured that I could \nwalk home from wherever I ended up.\nThe problem is, I didn't know just how far my high school's boundaries \ncovered. I started getting nervous when the bus I got on went into the bad \npart of town, then got on the highway, then went past a bunch of power \nplants and factories. After about fifteen minutes, I had no idea where I \nwas. I was in the middle of nowhere.\nI eventually admitted to the bus driver that I had \"accidentally\" gotten on \nthe wrong bus. She wasn't that surprised, since she didn't recognize me as \none of her regular riders. She had to stop the bus and we sat there for at \nleast ten minutes (delaying all the other kids who wanted to get home), \nwaiting for her boss to show up and drive me home. He dropped me off near \nthe school, and I walked home. Luckily, my mom wasn't home to notice that I \nshowed up late, so I didn't have to explain my little adventure to her.\nThe title of this video made me think of the story.\ufeff",
