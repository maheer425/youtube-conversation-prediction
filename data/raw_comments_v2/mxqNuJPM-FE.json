In 1977 it was estimated that some seven million gallons of \noil ranging in thickness from seven to seventeen feet in the soil and \ngroundwater underlying a portion of the former Bayonne site alone.\n\nChristie emailed the judge to tell him to not rule on the settlement, he \nhad settled with exxonmobile. Christie settled for $250M instead of \nreaching for the nearly NINE BILLION DOLLARS in the suit. Christie had \nintended to steal this $250M and put some/all into the states general fund. \nThis was to cover the huge shortfall in the budget. That shortfall was \nChristie's fault. Incompetence - probably, embezzlement - maybe, \nmismanagement - surely, ... any and all the ways crooked politicians rip \noff the people who elected them.\n\nChristie settled for less than 3%.  *A potential difference of $8.65 \nbillion dollars* the state and citizens of NJ would never see. The NJ state \nsenate is taking steps to block this.\n\nOh yea, exxon contributed $500,000 to the republicans governors association \nlast year, Christie was the chairman.\ufeff",
