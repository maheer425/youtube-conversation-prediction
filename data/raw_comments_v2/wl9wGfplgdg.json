Firstly, I think the Bentley is quite distinctive and has \na lot of character, and I doubt you'd mistake it for a car from any other \nmarque. For me, the Bentley is a lovely car and the Audi S4 is ugly. I find \nall Audi's to be so. I strongly dislike their styling. Secondly, I think \nthe ultimate Q-ship is probably the Mercedes E63 AMG Estate wagon, rather \nthan the S4. In my opinion,it looks better, has better acceleration and \nhandling, and has a great exhaust note as well.\ufeff",
