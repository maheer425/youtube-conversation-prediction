And he had a fiance'.\n\nThere has been a lot of chatter about the number of combinations, who broke \nthe code first, etc. If you are taking only your information from this \nmovie, then realise that while this movie is much more accurate than the \noriginal novel and book from the 90s, it *still* took far too many artistic \nliberties with the real facts to be of much use. An Alan Turing expert was \ninterviewed on the Aperiodical blog and corrected a LOT of what had been \nsaid in, of and about the movie facts. Not only did Hollywood's script take \nartistic liberties, but they also did a LOT of time dilation, which created \nevents that didn't even happen in some instances.\n\n\nIt's a very informative and entertaining blog posting: \nhttp://aperiodical.com/2014/07/an-alan-turing-expert-watches-the-the-imitation-game-trailer/",
