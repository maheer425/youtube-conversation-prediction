Your front wheels are normally \"snowplowing\", \nyou want to reverse that and have them point outwards instead. This will \nnot hurt the car.\n\nThe car won't track quite as well in a straight line, but it's barely \nnoticeable. When you hit a corner though, my God does it turn in well. If \nyou have a car that just plows into corners, this is a really easy cure.\n\nBeware though, having your steering towed out removes some of the safety \nfactor built in to your car's handling. It will corner much more easily, \nbut if you get too carried away with your cornering speed you'll be dealing \nwith 4 wheel drift or oversteer instead of plowing, and that requires some \nskill to manage.\ufeff",
