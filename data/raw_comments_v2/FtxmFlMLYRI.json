After reading a \nlot of the comments below, I'm guessing there is a lot of debate in the \nmathematical community on what is better to use when discussing circles. \nWhat is the function of tau? It can't be the same as pi; I don't understand \nhow that would be possible. This video was very visually appealing to watch \nas well as informative. I think that I am going to go look up the debate on \ntau and pi now! When I put tau into google, the first articles that come up \nare all about the comparison between pi and tau. It is crazy to me that I \nhave just been taught to accept pi! This isn't right! One should always \nquestion what he/she learn. All of this obviously means that this video \nhelped me question math.
