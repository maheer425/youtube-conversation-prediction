The guy behind the counter politely tried to explain that \nthe customer had to wait until the manager came over to explain the problem \nto him. Immediately the customer started cussing the poor guy out and told \nhim that if he didn't get his money NOW he was gonna punch his lights out. \nThe service worker\n told the jerk that if he laid one finger on him he was gonna kick his ass. \nSo the jerk began screaming at the top of his lungs-which of course brought \nthe manager running. He then began a BS story almost word for word like \nwhat is shown here. I couldn't believe it when the stupid manager actually \nstarted to fire the worker right then and there! Well hell, I'll be damned \nif I'm gonna stand there and let that happen to the poor guy! I told the \nmanager that the customer was a goddamn liar and that if the manager fired \nthe service worker then it was ME who was gonna be calling the corporate \noffice to complain, at which point two customers behind me (who had been \ntoo shy to get involved) spoke up and backed me.
