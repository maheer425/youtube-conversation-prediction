If you look at the way Danish does numbers you can see that \ntheir 50, 70, and 90 have \"halv\" in them, suggesting to someone who doesn't \nspeak any Danish that their system is based on a unit of 20 too - vigesimal \n(apparently the word for that) as opposed to decimal. Also in English \npeople did say things like 3 score and ten, so English and French are not \nthat far apart really. Also there are differences between English English \nand American English - we (in the UK) say one hundred and ten, whereas in \nthe US I think the \"and\" is not said, so we too have our difficulties. \nLastly it's interesting to see that the Japanese number system doesn't work \nin thousands but in tens of thousands - a million is hyaku man - 1 hundred \nten-thousand. The way to say numbers can be quite complicated? Oh, a last \nalso - in Switzerland septante, huitante, nonante are used and in Belgium \nseptante and nonante.\ufeff",
