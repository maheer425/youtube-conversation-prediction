Mhm thats how sneaky \nhe is, he sacrificed one year to finally lure you to his hideout but the \nlimo driver didn't listen to his instructions when you were blindfolded and \nyou arrived to that restaurat and not to the place where he prepared \nsacrificial altar for you. And by the way he had to fool everyone else so \nthat noone could warn you so he had to make all the proposal preparations \ntoo. And since you were really fooled for the first time ha thought to \nhimself \"oh what the hell lets go with that option\"\n\nAnd they lived together happily ever after. End of the story.\n\nI hope you can understand my english :]\ufeff",
