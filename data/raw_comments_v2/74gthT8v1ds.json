            "text": "Little facts for the novices.\n\"Production car\" yet they plan to produce only \"10\" per year,  check \nBugatti company and see how many they produce per year across the world, \nAhem.\nI think they should do some business and learn what's real production is. \nBugatti sold about 5 in it's 1st year and 44 in it's 2nd year and has \nmaintained this production figure over the subsequent years.\n\nBugatti worked with NASA just for its tyre production, and the reason for \nits aerodynamic and weight is to increase deceleration during breaks, when \nwe speak of bugatti as a fast car we speak of it as a \"quality car\"\nAnd Koenigsegg follows that same very thought about their car \nproduction,The reason why so is that the heavier a car, the better \ndeceleration and greater control can be achieved when gravity gains power \nas speed reduces, this is known as weight-shifting and it's very important \nfor smooth driving. They never wanted to build ONLY the fastest cars, they \nwanted to build FAST but also drive-ready car which won't cause trouble on \nthe road.\n\nThe same can't be said about Hennessy Venom GT which looks like a car with \nweight removal, tuned up engine , The wheel is racing spec with no over \nlayers just for the sake of weight reduction to gain than 1 mph over the \nbugatti veyron. \n\nTheoretically speaking for a car to be driven 'safely' above 240mph, it \nneeds to have about 1.300-1.400 Kg. I think the american producer didn't \nbother about security unlike sweden and german did.\n\nSo basically what i'm saying \n\nBugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse  - All Drive-able fast car - 2nd fastest \nacceleration to Hennessy Venom GT, very good handling and brake technology. \nKerb weight 1,800 kg                                                       \n                                            Has undergone NASA test and \nweight shifting test to ensure it will become the world drive-all  fastest \ncar. if they now wanted to make it a racing spec\n                                                                    that \ncar wouldn't even be at 1,800 kg :)  See 1st PS3 and 2nd version of PS3? ok \ngood.\n\nKoenigsegg Agera R - All Drive-able fast car -  Relatively good \nacceleration still even a Zonda has a better acceleration than this car- \nPossibly have the highest top speed due to its unique 8 engine symmetry, \ngear clench but that's why it does also fall a bit behind in acceleration , \ngood handling Kerb weight  1.400 kg. Koenigsegg company never really took \npart into Guinness world record set, but the fact still remains, this car \nhas the highest top speed and this is a generally agree by everyone even \nthere's no Guinness record about it.\n\nHennessy Venom GT -  \"Concept\" and \"TUNED\" car -  Fastest  acceleration \n1mph above Bugatti - No quality investment in brake system , lack of weight \n1,200 kg, has actually undergone \nweight reduction for 'RACING SPEC' to achieve this speed, using FOREIGN \nengine  ADDED superchargers to make it beat Bugatti by just 1mph. \n\nSo \"Fastest Tuned Car' , since Bugatti and Koenigsegg never really bother \nthemselves to tune their quality car to beat that Venom GT but taking the \nfact as it is 1mph is really nothing, it's actually funny. \n \n\n\n \ufeff",

Also, in the Tudor \nUnited Sports Car Series, the corvette racing team had won recently in \n2014. Second about horsepower, America makes some of the fastest race cars \nin the world, with the highest amount of horsepower. We don't need to \n\"corner\" in the U.S., we invented drag racing. Top fuel dragsters have over \n10,000 hp and do 0-315 mph in 3.2 seconds. In fact, half of drag racing's \nprofessional drivers consist of European drivers.This hennessy venom gt \nuses a lotus interior which is in fact from Europe, so your technology \nargument is rubbish. So I believe I've covered every aspect, so let's see \nyou come up with an argument now.",
