Everyone gets caught up in who the fastest is when no one cares \nwho is having the most fun. And that's what the internet has done. Fanboys \nof every loyalty sling mud at each other in the form of G force, top \nspeeds, 0-60 times, and lap records. Fun cannot be quantified, so there's \nno point in trying to argue with it. It's the reason that people would \nrather spend $50,000 on a stock SS Camaro from 1976 rather than a brand new \nSS with modifications. It's what those fanboys don't understand. A true car \nenthusiast cannot decide on their favorite car. I've bounced around from \nclassic muscle to modern JDM to classic Euro to modern Euro to classic JDM \nto modern muscle so many times in the span of a short week. Honestly, I'd \nsomeone offered me any car in the world right now, I'd be evenly split \nbetween a 1971 E-type, a 2008 BMW Z4 M coupe, a 1997 Dodge Viper, a 1967 \nCorvette Stingray, a Datsun 240Z, an R34 GT-R, and a Pagani Zonda F. It's \ntoo hard of a decision for a true gear head. That guy who will always argue \nthat Corvettes are the best or that GT-Rs are the best doesn't et the \npoint, usually because they've never owned one. There is a fun factor. So \nthe next time you're at a car meet, remember that a 1999 Honda Civic with \n$5k in mods could be more fun than a $250k twin-turbo Gallardo.\ufeff",
