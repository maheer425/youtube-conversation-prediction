I don't \nmind some vlogers because there are people who don't have the money or time \nto go to big places like Disney land or and different country and it's nice \nto see what it's like.\n\nI understand where you are coming from and for some points I agree. But the \nCEO's would've had to work there asses off just to get that promotion or to \nbuild up their company the ones who automatically get it from family and \nfriends those are the ones I don't like.\n\nNow musicians and actors... to a degree. People follow their lives and \nstalk them if there really famous. 1 wrong word and their whole career can \ngo down the drain, so I don't feel as good for putting down there price a \nwhole lot.\n\nSoldiers and doctors. I do agree that they should get a higher pay check \nbut there are some really bad soldiers and soma really bad doctors that \ndon't deserve that at all. They don't deserve to be called a doctor or a \nsoldier, but if we raise the bar to much then not too many people will want \nto do those things, but we'd need to raise the bar up if they're gonna be \npaid more.\n\nBut if we think about it if everyone was paid the exact same amount of \nmoney, why would someone try to get that higher role where they have to do \neven more work? That doesn't seem all that fare.\n\nOverall there isn't really anything as fare. We take life as it is and we \nhave to suffer through it. There isn't going to be any change any time \nsoon. Things will become corrupt and companies will fall to the ground, but \nthere isn't really anything a few hundred people can do, not without going \nto the extreme, and even doing that wouldn't help.

Neither do sports stars, musicians \nshouldn't either.\nHell the CEO's of companies shouldn't get paid as much for the little they \ndo, and when they fuck up they shouldn't get golden parachutes either like \nthe ex-CEO of Target getting a 75 million exit fee.

I'm just saying that YouTube is \na job, and it's the same as Directors. There are some/most movies that you \nmight hate but others absolutely love or some directors and even actors \nthat you feel the same way and others the opposite. Through other peoples \neyes they are the ones that they will follow even as there ship goes down. \nYou mightn't find them funny or entertaining but other people do and it's \nthe exact same thing for movies.\n\n3) I'm sorry if it sounded like I was saying that YouTube would manage to \n'disable Add Blockers' or something but I mean that they will figure out \nanother way to pay the YouTubers. For example a really good YouTube channel \nhas millions of subscribers and gets millions of views but they don't get \nmuch money because of Add Blockers. So they might try and find another way \naround it. So maybe if a subscriber watches a video depending on how much \nthey watch their videos and for how long they may give them money.\n\n4) But thats the thing, we're humans and even though we know that these \nthings will end we try our hardest to keep them alive, to live longer. The \ninternet was supposed to never really worked but here it is. People never \nactually thought that a computer would be popular and that millions of \npeople would buy them. But guess what, they are. Yes some things die out \nand most of the time people give up on them, but if/when YouTube dies \nsomething different will be created heck other things are being created \nright now and some are on the web right now. We create new things it's what \nwe do. And if what you say is true when do you think we will really stop \nmaking new content? Or making things better? 10 years? 100 years? whatever \nyou say it's a 1 in... well a long number that it's right. Oh, and sure in \nyour opinion I'm the stupid one.

Sure there are people on youtube that make videos and deserve \nto be paid, those are the people I turn my adblock off for. But people like \nLet's Players, people who read the video game news for views such as \nReviewtechUSA, people who act like complete dumbasses like Boogie and his \nFrancis character, they don't deserve to be paid. Sorry but that is not \nreal work.\n\n3) You honestly think youtube will find a way around adblock. Are you \nserious? The open source community is the one that created the adblock in \nthe first place, and they have taken companies to Microsoft to task and \nproduced better software than even the richest corporations. You are \ntalking about a community that turned a hobby OS Linux into something that \nruns 98% of the internet servers in the world and produces a OS that even \nValue along with other companies are taking notice as the user base grows. \nThis same community has helped create the worlds leading mobile OS android. \nThe same community that found a way to play Netflix on Linux when Netflix \nthemselves weren't going to allow it. The same community which has created \nWINE which can run Windows applications in Linux and that improves every 2 \nweeks. You think Google is going to beat them? Forget it, people like Hulu \nand Blip tried and failed miserably. They may get it blocked for a short \nwhile but the community will ALWAYS beat them. It's just a fact of life.\n\nYou are the moron here my friend. You think that people Boogie deserve to \nbe paid huge dollars for acting like a fucking spaz, you are the one who \nneeds to live in the real world. The youtube bubble will crash, it's \nalready beginning to crash as Google themselves have said they are not \nmaking money off youtube despite the billions of views. They are making it \nharder and harder for the \"content creators\" to make money off this site \nwithout giving them a bigger cut. Eventually Google is going to say fuck it \nand give these guys nothing, nowhere does it say they have to, and the \nbubble will burst. Then people like DSP,RTU, Boogie are going to have to \nface the real world again. Just like the housing bubble in 2004, it looked \nlike the good times will never end, everyone was making huge money on wall \nstreet and then October 2008 the bubble burst. Same thing happened in the \nlate 90's and early 2000's with the dot com bubble in which it was to never \nend and that bubble burst. It's happened time and time and time again \nthroughout human history, you are just too stupid to realize it.",
