            "text": "Many years ago (1999) I asked myself, \"If mathematical equations can be \ncombined, why can't I combine physics equations?\" in a fit of excitement, I \ngot my college physics books out and perused them for physical laws I could \ncombine. Newton's Force of Gravitation (F=GMm/rr) looked strikingly similar \nto Coulomb's Electromotive Force (F=KQq/rr) I set them equal to each other.\n\nI know what you are thinking, because I have heard it all before, \"Gravity \nand charge operate on totally different scales.\" Although, gravity \ndominates on the cosmic scale and charge dominates in the atomic scale; \nisn't it reasonable to assume, there exists a scale somewhere between where \nthey are somewhat comparable. Perhaps the scale where charge and gravity \nshare similar quantities is the engineering level. For example a maglev, or \nan elevator, or static electricity making your hair stand out like a \ndandelion.\n\nWhen I put Coulomb's Electromotive Force equal to Newton's Force of Gravity \nwith algebra, a dichotomy happened. Fortunately, the distance squared \nbetween the two objects, rr, canceled in both equations. Unfortunately, so \ndid the units of force. I thought, \"a physical equation without any units \nisn't very useful.\" So then, I multiplied by Einstein's Energy Equation \n(E=Mcc). There was two really good things that happened when I did this. \nGood thing one, I got some units back; instead of force it was an energy \nequation now. Good thing two, the capital M, the big mass, also cancelled, \nleaving me with the equation...\n\nE=LQq/m where L=ccK/G=1.2105e37(Kilogram*meters/Coulomb/Seconds)^2\n\nAs you can see by the units in L and the variables in this energy equation \nthat the mass in the denominator will cancel just one Kilogram in the \nnumerator and both Coulombs in the denominator will cancel with both \ncharges in the numerator. This leaves Kilogram * meters^2 / seconds^2 being \nthe same units for Joules, a measure of energy.\n\nThere are many implications made by my energy equation I call \"The \nAlgebraic Mesh of Three Physical Laws.\" One of them is for two non zero \ncharges and at least one of the objects having zero mass, an infinite \nenergy comes out of this equation. This is similar to the big bang. \nBasically asserting a new universe is born with every photon. The need for \nthe universe behaving in a modally different way from what we observe is no \nlonger needed. This lends to the idea that the universe has always been \nhere, forever behaving as we see it now. The reason we do not see an \ninfinite energy coming from a lightbulb is because almost all of it is \nexhibited outside our velocity bubble { the part of Einstein's energy \nequation that keeps everything in our visible universe within the speed of \nlight [ (1-vv/cc)^0.5 ] }\n\nMy equation with the velocity bubble included becomes simply...\n\nE=LQq/m(1-vv/cc)^0.5\n\nMy equation also has something to say about Dark Energy and Dark Matter. \nThese mysterious forces all around us are the gravitational effects of \nobjects outside the velocity bubble. In the same way a Black Hole's gravity \npulls light into it, transcending light's speed, Dark Matter's gravity \nreaches into our visible universe to hold the matter of galaxies together. \nDark Energy, the stuff that seems to be accelerating the universe apart, is \nagain objects outside the velocity bubble tugging on matter here in our \nvisible universe, only very far away. In summery, Dark Matter are objects \nclose by and Dark Energy are objects extremely distant. We can only observe \nthe effects of their gravity because they are moving faster then light.\n\nIf you break velocity in the velocity bubble into the discrete components \nand solve for time you get the true meaning of time.\n\nt=d/c(1-[LQq/mE]^2)^0.5\n\n...where t is time and d is a distance vector from v of the velocity bubble.\n\nIf there is a way to force LQq/mE to equal the value 1 time gets warped and \nyou could find yourself in limbo, a place where time stands still. Inside \nthe temporal asymptotes, on either side of zero, is a place where time \ncould be moving in a very different way from how we normally experience it, \nor possibly backwards.\n\nThe assertion that the universe was in a categorically different state in \nthe distant past \"The Big Bang\" is a fallacy. In light of this new equation \nit seems that the universe is infinitely old and has had no other state \nthen the one observed.\ufeff",
