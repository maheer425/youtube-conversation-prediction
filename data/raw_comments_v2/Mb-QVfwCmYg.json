Now, I have never worked with them, because I do not eat peppers \nas I have a very sensitive mouth (even the softest peppers cause me pain). \nWell I am pitting these and creating a sauce that is so strong just \nsniffing it makes your nose burn and eyes water. Well, I did not wear \ngloves, and did not know that peppers secreted an oil that stays on your \nhands even after you wash them. Well my hands were washed and I rubbed by \nupper lip at some point. I started to feel a tingly sensation and it got \nworse, it felt like it was burning. So I rubbed water on it (note that I am \nstupidly using my infected hands for this). I even used milk, but I \neventually got so frustrated, I decided to wash my face... not a smart \nmove. My eyes stung and I couldn't open them, the skin around my eyes \nstarted to go red, blotchy and bubbly and my hands were on fire. To cut a \nlong story short, I used bred on my face which absorbed the oil and reduced \nthe burning and my hands burned for two days straight getting worse any \ntime they touched water. As such I do not go near any pepper. If I ate the \none you guys ate just now I would die.\ufeff",
