            "text": "+assassinneo We have Black Series SLSs here in the 'States. The cars are \nstreet legal. And just like with any powerful car, people can have them, \nbut they would face consequences for something like being pulled over for \nspeeding or racing on the street. But we have drag strips and track days to \nreally allow us to drive our cars hard. And occasionally people do canyon \nruns where they drive a little faster than the speed limit, if you know \nwhat I mean. A co-worker of mine has an F430, and he tells me stories about \nhow he and his buddies get pretty crazy speed-wise on some of the canyon \nroads here in Southern California. So, sadly, we do have a speed limit, but \nif someone drives the pants off their car and doesn't hurt anyone or get \nnailed by the cops, then fun will be had. Luckily, here in the 'States, we \ndon't have the sort of fun-killing speed cameras that the Brits do. So \nhere, if you drive hard in the canyons and don't get caught, then \neverything is good. And again, we have drag strips and track days if we \nwant to attend those and get actual times driving on a real track.\n\nAnd I know there is an aero benefit from the aero parts on a Black Series, \nhowever I don't think I'll ever be driving so quick that the benefits of \nthe aero would have much of an impact. And even if there is a great aero \nbenefit from those pieces, I would make the trade to have a regular SLS \nbody over a Black Series because the lines of the \"regular\" SLS AMG are \ngorgeous, and like I said before, almost a perfect modern day \ninterpretation of the 300SL gullwing cars of the '50s. I would gladly give \nup the aero benefits of the big splitter, canards, boy-racer-looking mini \nGT3 fixed rear wing, etc, to have the classy, clean lines of a \"regular\" \nSLS AMG. And it would be a unique \"sleeper.\" The body would suggest regular \nSLS AMG, however under the body work, it's all Black Series. Motor, lighter \nbackbone, titanium exhaust, suspension...all the non-aero go fast parts of \na Black Series with the clean lines of a \"regular\" SLS.\n\nIf I were to take the car to Willow Springs here in California, and raced \naround the fasted of the three tracks (Big Willow), I think the differences \nin lap times between a car like I want and a full on Black Series would be \nnegligible. Even if the Black Series was 5 seconds quicker (which it \nprobably wouldn't be), I'd still rather have the custom job.\n\nThis is a car I'm going to be taking to work, and I really don't want my \ncoworkers seeing me drive around in a Black Series with that fixed mini GT3 \nrear wing, canards, etc. To them, it would just appear to be a nice clean \nMercedes SLS AMG, but with the grunt of all the Black Series internal \ngo-fast parts of a Black Series.\n\nAnd I see you're a fellow BMW fan as well. Am I right when I say that the \nmore performance minded models (like the M cars) are incredibly fun to \ndrive?\n\nI mean look what has happened to the original E30 M3 (from the '80s, for \nthose who don't know). They used to be cars one could buy for a few \nthousand dollars. Now they are going for 40k on average. Word is that the \nsame thing is going to happen with the E46 M3. The price spike is going to \nskip the E36 M3s and the numbers for E46 M3s, which can be had now for \nabout 12-15k, are going to skyrocket as well, into that same sort of 40k \nprice range that E30 M3s go for nowadays.",

The body kit is not just for better look, but also for aero \ndynamics and stability, you should know that. Also I assume you are an US \ncitizen, and as far as I know these cars are no use for streets, because of \nthe speed limits. In my country (Bulgaria) speed limits are just like \nwarning signs. Everybody drives at the speed limits his car is capable of, \nno matter the road and conditions. On the other hand it's a proper choice \nif you're gonna use it on a track. As for the BMWs I agree, as fan and \nowner I'd say BMWs give you pretty good experience on the road and on the \ntrack even if it's just stock.",

            "text": "+viktorftw You're right for the most part. But I don't think you're giving \nBMW or the i8 enough credit. Firstly, BMWs, particularly the E46 M3 and the \nfirst-gen M Roadster are amazing cars to drive. If you haven't driven a \nperformance (M) BMW, I definitely recommend it and I think you would change \nyour mind about BMWs.\n\nAnd with the i8, it's not just about the styling or not being a track \nmonster, it's about the concept of having a car that can hold it's own at \na track day and it's a green sport-hybrid with 357 hp and 400+ lbs./ft. of \ntorque. And emissions-wise, it would be nice knowing I would be doing my \npart for Mother Earth. i8s only emit 50g of CO2/kilometer. An average human \nbeing emits the same amount of CO2 with 50 breaths!\n\nSo, with the i8 option, it's more about balancing having a fun car that is \ngreen. The other two (and a used 458) are also great options, but that's if \nI want to go all and out track monster.\n\nYeah, so we kind of agree. But again, if you've driven one of BMWs M cars, \nyou would not get out of it thinking it has no soul to it. BMW may seem all \ntypical \"German efficiency,\" but the cars themselves have a lot of soul. \nThey are torque monsters. Like with an E46 M3 for example, there is no need \nfor a downshift if you want to pass someone on the highway. Just put your \nfoot down, even at low revs, and the tach needle speeds to redline. \n\"Ultimate Driving Machine\" right? If you were to drive the right BMWs, \nyou'd see that BMW isn't overstating things with that tag line. Some of \nthem may not be the quickest cars, but the driving experience is awesome. \nIt's kind of like how driving an MX-5 lets one drive the car hard and feel \nlike they are going superfast, but are actually going reasonable speeds. \nCertain BMWs are like that, but with more power.\n\nThanks for the advice though about a used 458. I hadn't even thought of \nthat. Now the decision is tougher! \u263a",

It \ndepends what you are out after, do you want a monster machine that sounds \nlike godzillas dad and looks stunning + is an eyecatcher I would not even \nthink about it and go for the SLS.\nGT3 is a great driving machine and porsche only makes quality cars. \n\nI8 for me is a little boring even if it looks like a space machine compared \nto the others, but its not a driving monster machine like the others, feels \nlike it has no soul.\n\nBtw tbh I would buy a used ferrari 458, its a great car for the price.\n\nFirst: SLS\nSecond:GT3\nThird:i8",

As for the studying aerospace engineering, it might \nseem tough at times, but the technology you'll be working with like CFD was \nsomething my generation had to adapt to. When I started, we still relied on \nwind tunnels and models as our best guess at a result.\n\nBut if you're studying it now, they're going to teach you all about CFD and \nall the newer computer stuff. All I can say is don't give up. It's a \nchallenging and rewarding career.\n\nLol, I can remember when CAD/CAM seemed like the most amazing thing ever \nand there was no way such technology could be topped.\n\nAnd I'm pretty sure they're still gonna teach you the older stuff, \nthe fundamentals. Depending on who you go to work for, you might still well \nbe using wind tunnels along with CFD.\n\nBut nowadays there's rapid prototyping, CFD, more advanced CAD/CAM. I'm not \nsaying those things are going to make things a walk in the park, they are \ntools that your bosses are gonna expect you use to come out with the latest \nand greatest possible.\n\nBut yeah, it's a great career, lot's a challenges, even some fun, lot's of \nfulfillment, so just keep studying!
