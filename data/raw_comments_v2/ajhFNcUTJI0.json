But as far as SR goes, *c* is \nconstant.\nIf this doesn't help, think of the Pythagorean theorem. We define the \ntriangle as a right-angle triangle. It might *not* be, in which case we \ncan't use the theorem. But for everything that the theorem describes, the \ntriangle has a right-angle.\nI hope this helps.

            "text": "The false justification of Einstein's relativity ( 0:29 ): \"Before Einstein \nwas even born, physicists showed that the speed of light was one of those \nabsolute things which can't be changed by a switcheroo. So any switcheroo \nwe do has to keep light moving at the same speed...\"\n\nNo physicist has validly shown, both before and after Einstein was born, \nthat the speed of light is constant. For instance, according to Maxwell's \n19th century electromagnetic theory, the speed of light (relative to the \nobserver) varies with the speed of the observer:\n\nhttp://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/Chasing.pdf \n John Norton: \"That [Maxwell's] theory allows light to slow and be frozen \nin the frame of reference of a sufficiently rapidly moving observer.\"\n\nhttp://culturesciencesphysique.ens-lyon.fr/XML/db/csphysique/metadata/LOM_CSP_relat.xml\n \n Gabrielle Bonnet, \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon: \"Les \u00e9quations de \nMaxwell font en particulier intervenir une constante, c, qui est la vitesse \nde la lumi\u00e8re dans le vide. Par un changement de r\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel classique, si \nc est la vitesse de la lumi\u00e8re dans le vide dans un premier r\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel, et \nsi on se place d\u00e9sormais dans un nouveau r\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel en translation par \nrapport au premier \u00e0 la vitesse constante v, la lumi\u00e8re devrait d\u00e9sormais \naller \u00e0 la vitesse c-v si elle se d\u00e9place dans la direction et le sens de \nv, et \u00e0 la vitesse c+v si elle se d\u00e9place dans le sens contraire.\"\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Time-Stephen-Hawking/dp/0553380168 \n Stephen Hawking: \"Maxwell's theory predicted that radio or light waves \nshould travel at a certain fixed speed. But Newton's theory had got rid of \nthe idea of absolute rest, so if light was supposed to travel at a fixed \nspeed, one would have to say what that fixed speed was to be measured \nrelative to. It was therefore suggested that there was a substance called \nthe \"ether\" that was present everywhere, even in \"empty\" space. Light waves \nshould travel through the ether as sound waves travel through air, and \ntheir speed should therefore be relative to the ether. Different observers, \nmoving relative to the ether, would see light coming toward them at \ndifferent speeds, but light's speed relative to the ether would remain \nfixed.\"\n\nAlso, in 1887 (prior to FitzGerald and Lorenz advancing the ad hoc length \ncontraction hypothesis) the Michelson-Morley experiment unequivocally \nconfirmed the variable speed of light predicted by Newton's emission theory \nof light and refuted the constant (independent of the speed of the source) \nspeed of light predicted by the ether theory:\n\nhttp://www.philoscience.unibe.ch/documents/kursarchiv/SS07/Norton.pdf \n John Norton: \"These efforts were long misled by an exaggeration of the \nimportance of one experiment, the Michelson-Morley experiment, even though \nEinstein later had trouble recalling if he even knew of the experiment \nprior to his 1905 paper. This one experiment, in isolation, has little \nforce. Its null result happened to be fully compatible with Newton's own \nemission theory of light. Located in the context of late 19th century \nelectrodynamics when ether-based, wave theories of light predominated, \nhowever, it presented a serious problem that exercised the greatest \ntheoretician of the day.\"\n\nhttp://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/1743/2/Norton.pdf \n John Norton: \"In addition to his work as editor of the Einstein papers in \nfinding source material, Stachel assembled the many small clues that reveal \nEinstein's serious consideration of an emission theory of light; and he \ngave us the crucial insight that Einstein regarded the Michelson-Morley \nexperiment as evidence for the principle of relativity, whereas later \nwriters almost universally use it as support for the light postulate of \nspecial relativity. Even today, this point needs emphasis. The \nMichelson-Morley experiment is fully compatible with an emission theory of \nlight that CONTRADICTS THE LIGHT POSTULATE.\"\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=JokgnS1JtmMC \n Relativity and Its Roots, Banesh Hoffmann, p.92: \"There are various \nremarks to be made about this second principle. For instance, if it is so \nobvious, how could it turn out to be part of a revolution - especially when \nthe first principle is also a natural one? Moreover, if light consists of \nparticles, as Einstein had suggested in his paper submitted just thirteen \nweeks before this one, the second principle seems absurd: A stone thrown \nfrom a speeding train can do far more damage than one thrown from a train \nat rest; the speed of the particle is not independent of the motion of the \nobject emitting it. And if we take light to consist of particles and assume \nthat these particles obey Newton's laws, they will conform to Newtonian \nrelativity and thus automatically account for the null result of the \nMichelson-Morley experiment without recourse to contracting lengths, local \ntime, or Lorentz transformations. Yet, as we have seen, Einstein resisted \nthe temptation to account for the null result in terms of particles of \nlight and simple, familiar Newtonian ideas, and introduced as his second \npostulate something that was more or less obvious when thought of in terms \nof waves in an ether. If it was so obvious, though, why did he need to \nstate it as a principle? Because, having taken from the idea of light waves \nin the ether the one aspect that he needed, he declared early in his paper, \nto quote his own words, that \"the introduction of a 'luminiferous ether' \nwill prove to be superfluous.\"\ufeff",
