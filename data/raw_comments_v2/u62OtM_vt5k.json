Marriage as an institution is about \nstable, long-term relationships, which we know encourage health, reduce the \nrisk of some diseases, and promote healthy families. All health \nprofessionals know that in those with chronic and severe illness, care \nalmost always relies in part on family. And when things get really \ndifficult, as when life and death decisions need to be made, physicians \nknow that talking with a patient's partner is not legally the same as \nworking with a patient's spouse. Many same-sex couples are now raising \nchildren, and the health of those children demands that their parents have \nthe full rights and protection of marriage. In our society, marriage is \noften essential to obtaining and keeping adequate health insurance coverage \nfor both members of a couple and for their children. \n\n.....The Supreme Court should require the full recognition of same-sex \nmarriage throughout this country. If the Court rules otherwise, whatever \nthe legal logic, a clear injustice will result. And that injustice would \ndamage the health and welfare of millions of Americans.\"\ufeff",

Even the ones you don't like. Duuuh. \nGetting legally married give a couple a huge number of important RIGHTS and \nlegal PROTECTIONS. And we cannot make laws just to deny rights and  legal \nprotections to a targeted group of people when it doesn't serve any legit \npurpose for a law. And nope, satisfying some stupid bigot is not a legit \npurpose for a law. \n\nAnd guess what? Gay people are tax paying citizens who have been \nsubsidizing YOUR lazy selfish ass by footing the  bill for YOUR marriage \nbenefits, bitch. Don't be so damned selfish. And guess what else? These \nlaws are not being overturned to \"make you accept it\". You really think any \ngay couple anywhere who has been working to get laws changed so they have \nequal legal treatment for their family (or any of the millions of other \npeople who support their rights) gives a flying fuck what you \"accept\"? \nNope. It's not about you, princess. Don't be so fucking self-centered and \npetty. You can still be a childish bigoted little shit stain if that's what \nyou want to be.

God is not on the internet, he \nis not watching Youtube, he is not tweeting on Twitter(well, technically he \noccasionally is, but let's just keep that hushed up for the time being.) \nSince God is not here, you do not have the power that is given to you by \nyour God here. You may be blessed with the powers to heal cancer and make \nblind men see and lame men walk, but here you are equal with we lowly \nmortals. Do not think that because I am not straight that I am not \neducated, that I have not read The Bible, that I have not stepped foot \ninside your holy places.  When we are inside your hallowed grounds, you may \nhave power above me, but seeing as we are not, you have none. You are no \nbetter than us, you have not the power to speak out against us, and you do \nnot have the right to speak over us or about us as if you are greater than \nwe are.  You are our exact equals.  There are things that you have done, \nMr. Glynn, that can and will be considered vile.  The actions you take \nagainst other human beings are, in fact, \"wrong.\" Not only are they wrong \nin the eyes of our law, they are wrong in the eyes of your God, and they \nare wrong in the eyes of your equals, both inside and outside the church. \nThere are other Pastors and Priests and Nuns that will look at this \nstatement and be ashamed that you would make the statement that you have \nmade under that title.  Because when you call yourself a Pastor, right \nbefore calling us \"wrong,\" you do not shame us. We are not afraid to be who \nwe are. \"The sodomites are out in force.\" If that is what you see us as, \nthen indeed, we are out in force. You could simply say that people who \nbelieve in the equality between each and every human being, are out in \nforce.  You will not force us to retreat back into the shadows, into our \nclosets of shame and fear and pain. No, we are out and we will stay that \nway. We will no longer be victims of your harassment, whether you are a Man \nof God or not. Welcome to a brand new world, Mr. Glynn. If this is your End \nof Days, then so be it, because it has always been stated that the End of \nDays cannot be stopped.  If you believe that this is the End of Days, then \ndo not try to stop it, because if you do, then you are claiming that you \nhave power higher than that of God.  If you do not believe it is the End of \nDays, but just a passing fad, then let it pass. Leave it alone, leave the \npeople to be who they are. Let them live their lives in peace, for if you \nbring them Hell, they it shall be Hell that is brought unto you at the end \nof the day.

It's just a \ntype of superiority complex that simply picks politically correct excuses \nto physically or verbally attack people.\n\nI am happy that hatred towards homosexuals is ending but I find it sad \nencouraging the acceptance of a disorder as being normal. It's like saying \n\"cancer is normal\". We don't hate cancer patients but no, it's not normal. \nI believe we now have this wave of \"being gay is normal\" idea simply \nbecause we have a population problem. Anything that decreases the rate is \nconsidered fine by higher ups and gay marriage does decrease the rate.\n\nI also don't like the fact that this started to turn people into \nhomo-addicts. Some people want homosexuals in every movie, book, game etc. \nthey see and when they don't, the producers are instantly hated for being \nhomophobic. This is ridiculous. Many things can be requested same way, race \nbeing the first that comes to my mind. How about we expect 1 example from \nevery race in every media and label producers to be racist when they leave \neven 1 race out? Some media will have homosexuals, some won't. Just learn \nto calm down, stop trying to turn it into a superior thing when claiming \nequality.\ufeff",

It changes nothing. But \neven if granting a marriage license to a same sex couple actually DID have \nany effect on procreative activity, it's still irrelevant because denying \nthe protections of marriage to same sex couples would STILL be a harmful \ndenial of Equal Protection and would still have no justification and would \nstill be unconstitutional. Understand? Those 'arguments' are all irrelevant \nto whether the ban would comply with the Constitution. And again, THAT is \nthe issue. Not anything to do with birth rates or any desire by the state \nto either increase or decrease them. The same sex marriage bans are being \nruled unconstitutional because they caused unnecessary harm to a targeted \ngroup, which violates the important constitutional principles of \"Equal \nProtection\".\n\nRegarding your odd comments about 'cheating', do you consider it cheating \nwhen a straight couple decides to use assisted reproduction? If not, why \nthe double standard that you only apply to same sex couples? But \nregardless, how other couples choose to go about this and how children \nenter into any family (whether by both people procreating together, \nassisted reproduction, step parenting or adoption) is, frankly, none of \nyour business. And it's certainly not any reason for our government to make \nlaws that harm and disadvantage some families in this basis. The government \nalready knows this. Why don't you? Again, \"Equal Protection\".\n\nYou don't seem to understand anything at all about the topic of RIGHTS OF \nCITIZENS or our CONSTITUTION. Why is that? Do you live in some other \ncountry that has nothing like a \"Bill of Rights\" and has a government that \nis based on the idea that people are some kind of 'property of the state', \nwith no recognition of their inherent rights as free citizens? Here in \nAmerica, our Constitution places great importance on the rights of \ncitizens, and places great importance on placing limits on the state's \nability to interfere with a citizen's autonomy as a free individual, free \nof unnecessary interference from the state and its laws.

Organizations don't agree because some people in charge want \nhomosexuality considered normal.\n\n3.For example Dr. Evelyn's test is suspicious. That's why all the peers' \ndecisions are suspicious. Continued on 8.\n\n4.Asking for evidence for obvious things makes you less believable. You \ndon't need evidence to know SOME gays did that because homosexuality was \nconsidered abnormal and gay marriage was not permitted. A gay won't marry a \nstraight in an environment where people tell gay marriage is ok and \npermitted and this is all the evidence you need.\n\n5 & 6.You still don't get my point or intentionally twist it. Marriage with \na new person with already existing kid is ok. What I mean is, gays will \nmarry other gays if everyone around tells them that it's ok and laws permit \nit. They won't have time & reason to marry a straight person to procreate. \nAnd once they married a gay partner, they shouldn't cheat on their partner \nso they can't make children from a third person. This is why gay marriage \nhas to effect birth rate, they won't have that children from straight \nrelationships prior to their gay partners because they will be directly \nmarrying with  gay partners, they will skip straight partners thus no kid, \nthus less birth so it's one reason they are letting it. I seriously don't \nunderstand what's so confusing here, unless you are intentionally doing it.\n\n7.Yes, and that's why I am focusing on science instead of law because law \ncan depend on science when it provides a valid reason. That's why it's more \nimportant to discuss science first to see if their conclusions are genuine \nor not, after that we can discuss law accordingly.\n\n8.Tell me then. According to the summary of the experiment, some scientists \nare asked to define homosexuals and straights depending on their results in \nthe test. Do you seriously think animal/kid lovers can't also pass the same \ntest? As far as I know animal/kid lovers are also socially function just \nlike any of us. If that test is enough, why don't they declare animal/kid \nlovers normal and people stop hating them? I am not saying harm should be \npermitted but at least nobody should consider them \"insults\" anymore \nbecause they will pass the test. Why then? Where's the difference? This is \nsuspicious conclusion on scientists end. They are certainly following \norders, bribed or something.

            "text": "+Azad Ward 1. No, you don't need to wait until same sex marriage is \n'everywhere' to see the facts. In places that have had same sex marriage \nfor ten or fifteen years, there is ten or fifteen years of data. And the \ndata shows that allowing gay couples to get a legal marriage instead of \nliving without those protections has had no effect on the procreative \nactivities of ANY citizens, gay or straight, and has had no effect at \nall other than to provide these couples with EQUAL LEGAL TREATMENT.\n\n2. And things that are not a disease obviously cannot have a cure, so the \nreason nobody is finding a 'cure' is because homosexuality is just a \nnaturally occurring and normal variation of human sexual expression. And \nit's interesting to note that you are now referring to homosexuality as a \n\"disease\". Where is your evidence of that? Why don't any health \norganizations agree with you?\n\n3. You are now suggesting that some gay people have bribed hundreds of \nthousands of health care workers and researchers to falsify research data \nfor many decades, from the lab assistants to the top of the World Health \nOrganization. That is not a serious argument and it makes you sound like a \ncrazy conspiracy theorist. It's baseless nonsense.\n\n4. Of course some gay people have married the opposite sex. But there's no \nevidence that these gays did so because the government was encouraging them \nto do so by denying them a legal marriage license document with a same sex \npartner, and THAT is the point. And even that website makes it clear that a \ngay person marrying the opposite sex is a bad thing, and that straight \npeople should marry straight people and gay people should marry gay people. \nOtherwise you have people being miserable in dishonest marriages, and \nthere's obviously no states interest in making that happen. It serves no \nbeneficial purpose and it DENIES EQUAL TREATMENT WHICH VIOLATES THE \nCONSTITUTION.\n\n5. There is absolutely no evidence anywhere to support your claim that \ngiving gays a civil marriage license causes fewer births 'because it makes \ngays adopt instead of marrying and procreating with the opposite sex'. \nThat's not the reason the laws are changing. They are changing because same \nsex couples who were being HARMED by laws that denied them marriage went to \ncourt and had the law challenged and the court ruled that they were right, \nthe law was unjust, harmful, unnecessary and unconstitutional. THAT is why \ngays are marrying. Because the law that prevented it was unconstitutional. \nThat is a FACT.\n\n6. No, just as I said above, the bans on same sex marriage are all being \nrepealed because they violated the Constitution. The government had no \nauthority to make such laws because they were a needless restriction on a \ntargeted group and denied them equal protection for no valid reason. It has \nnothing to do with the government wanting to either encourage gays to marry \nthe opposite sex because of your idea that 'it's wrong to not want to do \nso', or to marry the same sex to 'encourage a reduction in birth rates'. It \nis because the law violated the Constitution.\n\nAnd yes, anyone is legally allowed to procreate regardless if they are gay \nor straight or married or not. It is best to raise kids in a stable married \nhome, regardless if both parents are biological, or if one is, or if \nneither are. So it's best to allow all couples who are raising kids to \nmarry. There are MANY cases where a woman marries a man and has children, \nthey divorce, and then she gets honest with herself that she is really \nattracted to women. So she meets her new partner, another woman, and they \nraise her kids together as a couple, with one biological parent and one \nstep parent. Like lots of opposite sex couples with one biological parent \nand one step parent. And  denying them the protections of legal marriage \nwould needlessly harm their family. And that's why those bans are being \noverturned.\n\n7. Yes, there CAN be cases where the law is allowed to treat some people \ndifferently, when there is a valid reason, but NOT when there is no valid \nreason. For example, you can make a law denying a drivers license to blind \npeople. Yes, this treats them differently than other citizens, but it is \nnecessary to 'advance the states interest' in public safety. You CANNOT \nmake a law denying a drivers license to people with red hair, or people who \nare left-handed, because there is no rational justification for treating \npeople differently on that basis. Just like there is no rational reason to \ndeny the protections of marriage to couples based on the fact that they are \nthe same sex. Doing so is not rationally related to a legitimate goal for a \nlaw. It merely imposes harmful discrimination for its own sake and has no \nlegitimate useful purpose. THAT is why the courts are overturning those \nbans. Got that?\n\n8. So now you still won't accept the results of peer-reviewed scientific \nstudies unless you can personally contact every participant in these \nstudies and re-create the entire study yourself?  Do you understand what \n'peer-reviewed' means? These studies have already been subjected to \nrigorous challenge by other researchers. But whatever, you are free to \npersonally insist on clinging to some made-up personal 'theory' that \nhomosexuality is a 'mental disorder' or a 'disease', even though decades of \nresearch by every major health care agency proves this wrong, and even \nthough you are basing this idea on rationale that has nothing to do with \nhow something like that is actually determined, and instead basing it on \nnothing more than the baseless assumption that someone has a 'mental \ndisorder' or a 'disease' simply because they have no interest in having sex \nwith and procreating with the opposite sex. If that kind of delusional \nthinking makes you happy, knock yourself out. \n\nWhen you say it's \"unbelievable\", you are basing that on the assumption \nthat everyone \"should\" be straight and everyone \"should\" want to procreate \nwith the opposite sex. That is just your bias and there is no reason to \nautomatically believe that everyone \"should\" do so. The fact is that some \npeople are just gay. They always have been. And there is no reason to \nassume that they \"should\" be straight. Are you aware that in the past, \npeople thought that everyone \"should\" be right-handed and they went to \ngreat effort to force ALL children to be right handed? This was a biased \nassumption about what everyone \"should\" be based on some religious dogma. \nSome people are gay, and there's no reason to assume that they \"should not\" \nbe gay.\n\n8. You end with more delusional conspiracy theory nonsense with zero \nevidence\n\n\nLook, we can go on with this forever, and there is no law that says you \nhave to change your views, but the bottom line is that laws which denied \nthe protections of marriage to gay couples were unjust, needlessly harmful, \nand violated the Constitution's requirement for providing our citizens with \nthe equal protection of our laws. That is a proven fact, fully documented \nin over forty recent state and federal court cases all across this country. \nYou don't have to like it, you don't have to understand it, you can ignore \nthis truth if you want. But the fact remains that these laws could not be \nallowed to continue harming gay citizens by depriving them of their rights, \nand THAT is why they were overturned. Not because of anything to do with \nbirth rates. They were overturned because we do not allow pointlessly \nharmful and unconstitutional laws to remain in effect. They get taken to \ncourt, proved unconstitutional, and they get overturned, and we continue to \nmove toward our constitutional ideals of liberty and justice for all \ncitizens.",

            "text": "+TheDavep2 1.I was thinking these things happen in turns. So until \neverywhere permits gay marriage, other things are far away. However once \nthis happens, they'll start permitting other things as well gradually. \nYou'll have to wait and see for this one. I must have told that we may not \neven see this in our life times, it's not an instant process afterall.\n\n2.Every disease has a cure, just not discovered yet.\n\n3.There are various ways to stop, like bribing or threatening. Do you have \nany access to private lives of these scientists? Who knows what's really \nhappening behind walls.\n\n4.That happened in history. Check www.gayhusbands.com for example. Numbers \ncould be exaggerated but do you seriously think this stuff NEVER happens? \nNot even ONCE in entire human history? Don't go full throttle refusal.\n\n5.Gay step parent is not the issue. For that biological child to be borned, \nthe gay has to have a straight relationship first. That's what all these \nrights prevent, less gays will have straight relationship because they can \nsimply have gay relationship thus no birth. I didn't say adoption is bad, \nin fact it helps my theory, most gays adopt so by letting them marry \neachother the government causes them to adopt instead of them giving birth \nfrom straight relationships. Also, I don't say this applies to 100% of \ngays. Remember my theory is that government wants to help decrease birth \nrate so even if only a portion of gays skip that straight relationship part \nand don't have biological kid, it's good for the rate.\n\n6.I said they should but they don't because they have more interest this \nway. In other words, they know homosexuality is a disorder but since they \nhave these other interests, we have these \"gay is normal\" wave when in \nreality it's not.\n\nNow what's this: \"Anyone, gay or straight, who wishes to procreate, can do \nso, regardless if they are legally married to anyone.\" What??? So it's OK \nfor gays to sleep with someone else to just make a child WHILE they are \nmarried to another gay??? Why don't we just get rid of marriage all \ntogether!!!\n\nEven if some would do that, some won't, which is my point.\n\n7.Law is not about full equality, it can depend on science. For instance \nsome mental people are prevented from rights like marriage or driving, \nbecause science tells they are unable. If science says homosexuality is \nwrong in certain ways, laws can always go against it. However science must \nbe independent. Scientist shouldn't present findings based on what law or \nrulers want. That's why I'm concerned with science side more. Why they \nthink it's normal while animal/kid loving is not.\n\n8.Finally, some names from you after days... I did try looking some \nresearch up but they were talking about surveys or observing when they \ncould simply lie or act. Now I'll have to check yours.\n\nI did have a quick look at Dr. Evelyn's. It states that the participants \nwere anonymous so I really don't how to check anything. However if I accept \nthe tests were genuine, just like I suspect, the method used can also be \nused to prove animal/kid lovers are normal. I still wonder how scientists \ndefine the difference. They observed homosexual and straight groups and \nasked other scientists to determine their orientation from the records. I \nam sure animal/kid lovers can easily pass the same tests. And these \nresearch seem to be mostly on psychology, what about biology. How can they \nsimply disregard the fact that gender and pleasure are related to \nreproduction, it's unbelievable really...\n\nI still think they concluded homosexuality is normal because they or \nsomeone wanted it considered normal. Meanwhile animal/kid loving is still \nconsidered sick even if same things apply to them. People in control twist \nthings however they want.",

No, it DOES matter that gay couples have been marrying for many years \nbecause it means all of your idiotic 'the sky will fall if the gays start \nmarrying' arguments are already proven false by years of facts.\n\n2. So now you're saying that this magic \"medication\" doesn't exist? You're \nadmitting your earlier comment was bullshit? Okay.\n\n3. You then claim once again that \"the gays are preventing people from \nstudying this!\" as an excuse for why this magic medication hasn't been \nfound yet. How convenient for you. Except it's bullshit because any health \nagency or medical research agency or drug company can study whatever they \nwant to study, and your claim that \"gays are stopping them!\" is more random \nbullshit that you just dreamed up to prop up your other dumb claims. The \ntruth is that there is no reason for any of these entities to try to come \nup with any 'cure' for something that is not a 'disorder' and has no need \nof a 'cure'. They understand this. You don't. That's your problem, not \ntheirs.\n\n4. You then claim that gays choose to marry the opposite sex BECAUSE they \nare denied a marriage license with a gay partner, but again you have zero \nevidence of this. And it wouldn't be a valid goal for the state anyway.\n\n5. Then, you claim they have kids with that opposite sex spouse but they \nwould never choose to be a biological parent if they married a same sex \nspouse, and again the facts of the last decade prove you wrong. Gay people \ncan and do choose to be a biological parent if they want to. They always \nhave, regardless if the state offers them a legal marriage or not. They \nsometimes raise their own biological child with a same sex partner they \nmeet after the child was born, who becomes a step parent, just like lots of \nopposite sex couples raising kids where one is the biological parent and \nthe other is a step parent. They may choose to use assisted reproduction \ntechniques, just like lots and lots of opposite sex couples where one \nwishes to be a biological parent and they cannot procreate with their \nspouse. And adoption is a GOOD thing and serves a valuable purpose. It \nrescues children who were abandoned by their straight parents who \nprocreated irresponsibly and walked away from their responsibilities. \nleaving their kids to be cared for by the state and other citizens.\n\nAnd there is no reason for the law to disadvantage ANY of these couples by \ntargeting them to deny them equal protections, whether they are both the \nbiological parents, whether one of them is the biological parent and the \nother is the step parent, whether they use assisted reproduction or not, \nwhether they adopt or not, whether they raise any kids at all, and whether \nthey are the same or the opposite sex. You keep trying to apply rules to \nsame sex couples for things that ALSO apply to opposite sex couples, which \nmakes your arguments illogical and invalid. You would know all of this if \nyou would stop being so ignorant and read the trial rulings and get the \nfacts.\n\n6. You NOW claim that you never said the government should try to coerce \ngays into marrying someone of the opposite sex and procreating with them, \nbut that's clearly a lie. You have repeatedly tried to argue that this is \nexactly what you think the government should do, and that you think the way \nto do that is for the state to harm gays by denying them the right to marry \nthe person they want to marry, and thus forcing them to marry the opposite \nsex if they wish to avoid the terrible harm caused when a couple is denied \nthe legal protections of marriage. And you offer some argument about 'fewer \nbirths' as justification for all of this. Of course none of that is valid \nbecause the state has no such interest in persuading gays to do that, and \neven if it tried to, that's not a valid goal for the state and not a valid \npurpose for a law, and it has nothing to do with birth rates anyway, as has \nbeen abundantly proven in case after case. Anyone, gay or straight, who \nwishes to procreate, can do so, regardless if they are legally married to \nanyone. But that is what you have repeatedly tried to argue. Because you \nSTILL won't look at the facts.\n\n7. You say 'law comes later'. No, since the entire topic of this video and \nthis debate is the question of RIGHTS for gay citizens and how they ought \nto be treated by our laws, and whether our laws can deny them important \nrights like their right to EQUAL PROTECTION, this entire topic is clearly a \nmatter of LAW. What the law can do, what it cannot do, what makes the law \nconstitutional or unconstitutional. For this issue, the question of LAW \ncomes first and last. As I have explained to you, your opinion about gays \nand my opinion about gays and the general public's opinion about gays is \nirrelevant to this question. You are completely ignoring the reality of how \nthis issue is decided. It is decided by applying the process of \nconstitutional law to examine the law. It is not decided by anyone's \npersonal opinion about the group being affected.\n\n8. There are decades of research using a wide variety of standardized \nmethods for determining if someone has a 'mental disorder' and these have \nbeen used for studying the question of whether homosexuality has anything \nto do with the criteria that would classify someone as having a 'mental \ndisorder'. These don't include \"surveys\", as you keep suggesting. They are \ntests which reveal if there is a negative impact on a person's ability to \nperceive reality accurately, or on their ability to participate in and \ncontribute to society as others do, or on their ability to respond to \nsituations and stimuli as others do, and they are studies of huge amounts \nof statistical data.\n\nOne of the early studies was done by Dr. Evelyn Hooker, who took a group of \nstraight people and a group of gay people and had them all tested by other \ndoctors, who were not made aware of the sexual orientation of the subjects, \nusing a variety of these standard tests. The doctors were then asked to \nreview the test results and try to determine which subjects were straight \nand which were gay. They concluded that there was no way to tell, and there \nwas no indication in the test results which would suggest any pattern of \n'mental health' being linked to sexual orientation.\n\nOther research has been done by reviewing huge amounts of statistical data \nabout large numbers of people, including school records, military \nperformance records, employment records (to determine things like a \nsubjects ability to keep a job) legal records to look for patterns \nregarding getting into trouble with the law, etc. These reveal that being \ngay has no negative effect on any of these standard indicators of a \nperson's ability to participate in and contribute to society.\n\nYou can also look up the works of Dr. J.S. Bohan. You can also find out \nwhat these groups have to say about their research: American Psychiatric \nAssociation, the American Psychology Association, the American Medical \nAssociation, the North American Counsel on Adoptable Children, American \nAcademy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, National \nAssociation of Social Workers, the World Health Organization, etc.\n\nAnd in NONE of these studies has any group suggested that there is any \nvalidity to your idiotic idea of classifying someone as having a 'mental \ndisorder' simply because they have no interest in having sex with and \nprocreating with someone of the opposite sex. They say things like this, \nfrom the APA:\n\n\"Lesbian, gay and bisexual orientations are not disorders. Research has \nfound no inherent association between any of these sexual orientations and \npsychopathology. Both heterosexual behavior and homosexual behavior are \nnormal aspects of human sexuality. Both have been documented in many \ndifferent cultures and historical eras. Despite the persistence of \nstereotypes that portray lesbian, gay and bisexual people as disturbed, \nseveral decades of research and clinical experience have led all mainstream \nmedical and mental health organizations in this country to conclude that \nthese orientations represent normal forms of human experience. Lesbian, gay \nand bisexual relationships are normal forms of human bonding. Therefore, \nthese mainstream organizations long ago abandoned classifications of \nhomosexuality as a mental disorder. \"\n\nYou could have easily looked up all of this and more, instead of clinging \nto your own made-up idea that you already know has never been given any \nvalidity by any of the studies done by any major research agency.\n\nBut again, you are free to think whatever you want to think about gays. You \ncan be as prejudiced as you want. And you can justify that based on \nreligious beliefs, or on odd 'theories' that you invent to prop up your \nviews, or you don't even have to justify your prejudice.  It's a free \ncountry and you can think whatever you want about gays. But make no mistake \n- while you can be prejudiced, THE LAW CANNOT. You have no justification \nfor your prejudiced views being given any force in our laws.",

So that paragraph of yours \nis irrelevant.\n\nSecond, how do they \"become parents\"? You still don't get that the births I \nam referring to are the ones a gay person makes with opposite gender. \nAdoption is irrelevant, tell me if a gay actually \"makes a baby\", \"gives \nbirth\" WHILE they are married to eachother. If they do, then it means they \nare openly cheating on their gay marriage.\n\nThird, I kind of say the opposite. Government has interest in letting gays \nto marry eachother one of them being slight help for birth rate I explain \nbut you constantly fail to understand so that's why they are permitted even \nthough it's a disorder.\n\nMy views are interpretations of nature. Why do you think we have genders \nand only opposite genders are able to reproduce? Where do you think \n\"pleasure\" comes from? Do you think pleasure has absolutely no relation to \nreproduction? I may not be a scientist but at least I know some. You have \nabsolutely no idea what biology and chemistry are. You have no idea that \nmany of our feelings are actually coming from hormones and biochemical \nprocesses within.\n\nLack of cure doesn't make it normal. No natural disease starts of with a \ncure ready, people need to discover it later. For this, people need to \nsearch but how can one search when people consider it normal and try to \nsilence anyone who thinks it's disorder?\n\nAnd stop with the courts. Apparently, one reason for court decisions is \nthat health agencies claim it's normal. Court may decide differently if it \nwas considered a disease (like how they prevent certain rights for some \nother diseased people) so the main concern here is whether it's a disorder \nor not. This brings us back to the same question. Where's your evidence \nthat explains why homosexuality is perfectly normal? Show me a research \ndata that explains why gender means nothing while species and age are \ntaboo. And do not start with \"harm\" concept again.\n\n\"Harm towards other\" is a valid reason for laws, not science. There's so \nmuch \"harm towards other\" happening in nature already. Everyday billions of \nliving creatures are harmed by another. Tell me why those scientists think \nhomosexuality is normal yet animal/kid loving is not, aside from harm to \nvictims? Do they have any logical reason for this discrimination? You are \nthe one who claims that there're vast amount of research, I want to know \nhow scientists decided so why not tell me already? Give me a link to a good \nresearch so I can read and understand what is wrong with my interptretation \nof nature.\n\nOtherwise, admit that you are just a politically correct sheep who never \nread any of those research or admit that those research are faulty with the \npurpose of letting gay marriage while still keeping animal/kid loving a \ndisorder, in other words scientists find proof for what laws tell them to.",

What country do you live in? \n\nSecond, where is your evidence that allowing gays to have the same legal \nrights of civil marriage as opposite sex couples has caused gays who wanted \nto be a parent to decide not to be a parent and therefore cause \"fewer \nbirths\"? They can still be a parent if they want to, regardless of marriage \nlaws. They have ALWAYS been able to be parents, with or without the legal \nprotections of civil marriage.\n\nThird, where on earth are you getting the idea that the government has any \ninterest in trying to coerce gays to marry the opposite sex???? That is \ncompletely false.\n\nYOU may think that everyone, gay or straight, \"should\" marry the opposite \nsex and have babies, but that is nothing more than your personal view, and \nwe don't make laws that harm groups of citizens by denying them the \nprotections of marriage with the consenting person they choose to marry, \njust to appease your personal views.

He\nclaimed that organizations concluded that homosexuality is a natural \nand normally occurring variation of sexual orientation. I object because\nthere aren't many ARTIFICIAL diseases/disorders anyway.Do\nyou seriously not understand fewer birth claim? Some gays marry \nopposite sex and make children. Watch Brokeback mountain, the guy had a \ndaughter. It's a movie but there are gays who do that. Now, when gay \nmarriage is \npermitted and gay relationship considered totally normal, they won't marry \nopposite gender anymore and since 2 \ngays can't make a child, less children will be born. Or are you suggesting \nthat gays marry but also continue to make children with other people? Do \nthey openly do what we call cheating on your spouse? That's some fcked up \nmarriage then...You are trying to avoid your responsibility and just line \nall those at once. Listen here! I don't have to be a scientist and make \nlot's of research to believe something. My logic tells me that the function \nof gender, sex and pleasure is reproduction in nature so a healthy human \nshould feel attracted to an adult opposite sex human. That's it. Now if you \napproach me telling that it's wrong, you can't just get away with telling \n\"because there's research\". Higher ups can control media, research and many \nstuff to provide fake evidence to control society.Now tell me. Did you read \nany of those research? Did you validate? You obviously didn't but incase \nyou did, I'm just asking for a research that I can reason with. Why should \nI pay no attention to gender but for some reason species and age are \nconsidered limits? How come feeling attracted to kids or animals are \nconsidered \"insult to society\" yet same gender is perfectly normal? !AGAIN! \nI'm not telling to permit harm towards animals or kids. Why those people \nare considered sick or hated? Do you think they chose it? If it's easy for \nyou to believe same gender is not a choice, why can't you believe \nkid/animal affections are also not choice? There's clearly irrational \nevaluating done on scientists end. They conclude one is natural yet the \nothers are not. Why? Just show me a proper research so I can examine why \nthey concluded this way. AGAIN, if their reasoning is \"can occur \nnaturally\", then they should also conclude that liking kids, animal or \npretty much anything you can imagine is perfectly normal because in the \nend, they all can occur naturally. No one artificially planted thoughts \ninto kid/animal lovers heads you know.So before trying to switch the \nsubject to laws or anything in an attempt to avoid providing a reasonable \nresearch, tell me why my reasoning is wrong. Why is it that gender poses no \nabnormality for sexual affection yet species or age are definitely \nabnormal? Where's the proper research, the method, the procedure?How funny \nis that you claim there're vast amounts of peer reviewed research yet \ndespite all my efforts, you can't show any that looks reasonable. Either \nbecause it doesn't exist or you never read them to find one. You just jump \non the politically correct wagon and shout \"shut up, there's research\".",

It requires that all laws must serve a legally valid \npurpose and not simply disadvantage an unpopular group and amount to \ndiscrimination for its own sake. It requires that the actual EFFECT of the \nlaw must at the very least be rationally related to the stated GOAL for the \nlaw, and that stated goal must be a legitimate 'states interest'. \n\nAnd laws that deny civil marriage to same sex couples fail all of these \nbasic tests for constitutional compliance, and that is why they are all \nbeing ruled unconstitutional all over the country.\n\nThey apply unequal legal treatment by disadvantaging the targeted group of \nsame sex couples who wish to marry and receive the same important \nprotections of law from civil marriage that are afforded to other couples \nwho are allowed to legally marry. This causes real, particularized harm \nthat is a matter of verified evidence in the judicial record. Even the \nopposing lawyers don't deny that these laws have this effect on the \ntargeted group.\n\nAnd in case after case, the lawyers tasked with defending these bans by \noffering some rational justification for the ban and some legitimate goal \nachieved by the ban were unable to do so. The justifications that have been \noffered are either false claims, fail to show a rational relationship \nbetween the effect of the law and the claimed goal for the law, or the \nclaimed goal for the law wasn't even a legitimate states interest in the \nfirst place. None of the arguments offered to try to justify these laws has \nsurvived logical scrutiny.\n\nWe do not make harmful and unjust laws just to appease the personal \nprejudices of a group of citizens. That is not a valid purpose for a law. \nIt does not matter what you personally think about gay citizens. Appeasing \nyour personal prejudice is not a legitimate 'states interest'.

Gay people \nhave ALWAYS raised kids, with or without the legal protections of a civil \nmarriage license, so there's plenty of facts and data about this.

It may be based in \nmisinformation, religious beliefs, or it may be just plain prejudice.\n\nBut a question - how can you say that you have no problem with gays, and \nyou are not saying they shouldn't have rights, but you object to them \nraising their kids?\n\nPicture this - a woman marries a guy and has a kid, then they divorce and \nshe is raising the kid alone. Then she gets honest with herself about the \nfact that she has always really been attracted to women. She meets her \nperfect soul mate (another woman) and they want to spend the rest of their \nlives together supporting each other as a couple and a family, no different \nfrom any other couple who fall in love and want to marry and spend their \nlives together. \n\nSo in that scenario, if you don't think she should be raising her own child \nsimply because she is a lesbian who has found a great relationship with \nanother person, what do YOU think should happen? Should she never be \nallowed to be in a relationship and be forced by law to raise her kid \nalone? Should she be forced by law to choose between raising her kid and \nmarrying her partner? How could a law interfere with someone's parenting \nand family life like that without violating that person's rights and \nviolating the Constitution?\n\nAnswer: It can't. There's no legitimate reason for a law to interfere with \nsomeone raising their kid (either biological, stepchild, or adopted) simply \nbecause that person happens to be gay. Such laws would be unnecessary, \nharmful, discriminatory, and would serve no legitimate legal purpose. They \nwould do nothing except appease the personal views of people who have an \nanti-gay prejudice, and that's not a valid reason to enact a law that would \nintrude on a citizen's rights like that.",

Also, is there some magic 'medication' that makes \nanimal/kid lovers turn straight?

The ones that 'hurt' \ncan be punished for the harm but why punish people who just fap to pictures \non their own without harm? Isn't it same type of meddling?\n\n4.Government makes laws against animal/kid lovers to prevent them from even \nfapping and instead make them go for normal sex. Don't we think that by \nmaking laws and oppressing those who enjoy animal/kids prevents them from \nliving that lifestyle?\n\nSo, I understand your points but you fail to realise that same points can \nbe made for animal/kid lovers who do their thing without actualy hurting an \nanimal/kid.

But today, the U.S. Supreme Court \ndeclined to issue such a \"stay\", meaning that same sex couples can now \nbegin legally marrying in the state of Kansas, regardless of any additional \nfoot-dragging and frivolous litigation attempted by the state to delay the \nimplementation of the mandate from the 10th Circuit.   \ufeff",

Same goes for gay hate, I \nbelieve homosexuality is a disorder so I don't hate gay people that I think \nhave a disorder but I don't accept they are normal either. They should have \nall the right just like other sick people except marriage/adoption because \nthe function of gender is reproduction and if your feelings aren't \ndirecting you in the correct way, there clearly is a disorder. Gays' \nfeelings about love and parenting are unhealthy and we should prevent that \njust like how we prevent underage people because we don't trust their \nreasoning yet.
