The personal God is \nwhat religious people believe in, the God that will answer your prayers, \nthe God who knows you and everyone in the world, the God that loves \neveryone, yet punishes you if you are evil. very paradoxical, very \nconfusing. Personally, like Kaku, I believe in the God of simplicity. Not \nnecessarily a God that we can observe with our own eyes, but perhaps a God \nthat governs the several dimensions above us, the God that is beyond the \nmultiverse. I believe God is math. He's got this universe, and all other \npossible universes, down to a science. And though we'd like to believe that \none day we'll have a single equation that can \"read the mind of God,\" I \nthink those are high aspirations. No matter how far we develop mathematics \nand physics, I don't think we can ever fully understand God, coincidences, \ninter-dimensional time, the afterlife, and separate universes from our own.\ufeff",
