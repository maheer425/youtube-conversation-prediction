But the the chickens have \ncome home to roost now, the 2008 crisis saw the end to cheap credit and the \nillusion evaporated.\n\nWe have seen a change in consumer habits from luxury and mainstream brands \nto cheap alternatives, supermarkets are the clearest example of this. \nPeople are dumping ASDA, Morrisons, TESCO etc. and are now doing their \nshopping at Aldi, a cheapo store they would once turn their noses up to. \nCreating a race to the bottom in that sector, with the workforce and \nsuppliers being forced to accommodate these tighter margins.\n\nA poorer society means once successful businesses go under, with the \nremaining having to adapt to survive. They often do this at the expense of \nthe labour force, creating an never ending spiral of impoverishment as \nworkers on lower pay chase cheaper goods. People forced onto zero hour \ncontracts and other terrible employment conditions aren't going to run out \nan impulse buy the latest thing, they cannot afford to, so the economy \nsuffers. Government tax receipts fall as less people qualify for income \ntax, justifying even more cuts that push more people into low wage \nconditions.\n\nIf businesses are so intent on committing suicide they need only continue, \nkeep strangling the wages that are ultimately the source of your income. \nKeep paying your workers less and less, so they spend less and less on your \ngoods and services.\n\nWe need an intervention to introduce more disposable income into the \neconomy. If businesses refuse to be part of that solution, then as always \nthe government has to step in and do it for them. They're already doing \nthat with unemployment benefits and income support such as tax credits, \neffectively supplementing the public's income. Arguably quango jobs are \nanother measure to get money flowing through the economy rather than have \nit hoarded on some offshore balance sheet, where so much of businesses \nprofits often end up.\n\nThey don't care about the inefficiency of all this because we're trapped in \ndated ideology, requiring people to do any unproductive busy work to \"earn\" \nthe economies supplemental disposable income, because the idea of just \ngiving people the money is such a toxic one in the old mindset. We're \npissing money up a wall rather than implementing a basic income, simply \nbecause the political and social mindset isn't ready.\n\nWe have to ask ourselves why the economy exists, whether it's ultimately to \nserve the public good or if we human beings are a disposable commodity to \nbe sacrificed at the economies alter. There are actually people who believe \nthe latter, but argue it leads to the former, that human suffering in \nnecessary for the greater good (even if you can't see it). I personally \ndon't believe in that free market preacher ideological nonsense, I'd rather \nwe work towards a future for everyone rather than a system of stabbing each \nother in the back to get ahead; fighting over artificially limited \nsecurity.\ufeff",

            "text": "This is, in effect, a wonderful idea that Will indeed manifest as an \neventual and inevitable solution--hopefully sooner rather than later. \n Whether \"exactly as such\" or an equivalent.\n \n  The eradication of poverty is something that could, and indeed Should, \nhave been accomplished decades ago.  The fear and paranoia against such an \nidea as this, have to do with an individual's difficulty in letting go of \nvery outdated and one-sided paradigms in regards to social structure and \n(un)equality.\n\n  There are a few  types of people will view this type of discussion \nnegatively, some of which are:\n\n 1. The uninformed.   Those who do not understand how it benefits humanity \nas a whole--everyone involved, and we can examine the points made in the \nvideo.  But let us apply a very easy-to-understand example of how this does \nindeed effect everyone:  If people can no longer afford things (and \njoblessness is on the rise) then goods and services cannot be bought/paid \nfor, and will thus themselves decline.  Look at many companies shutting \ndown, because they make less profit due to less sales--less sales due to \njacked prices since people cannot afford to buy anything.  That is for an \neasy example.\n\n 2. The already-comfortable.  Those who already do have good jobs and good \nincome who do not understand just how horrible and disheartening and \ndemoralizing poverty really is.  \"I am good, therefore it doesn't matter as \nlong as I am good.\"  Really?  And starving children are of no account? \n World poverty is on the rise, and it is no less than a disgusting \nembarrassment on humanity as a whole and verily an abomination.  Denying \nthe truth of this is no excuse.  People die prematurely and early Every Day \ndue to the outcome of a multitude of manifestations of poverty,\n\n 3. The elitists and their Deliberate \"misinformants\" or disinformation \nagents--persons who are actually employed (yes, true) by the mega rich \nelitists whose role is to accuse and nay-say these solutions--solutions, \nwhich in effect ruin many of their schemes (fake money distributed \nunequally via banking, monopolization, over-taxation) which includes and \nresults in the putting of many millions in debt and chained to slave-wage \njobs.  \n\n Money does not really exist, in a manner of speaking.  Modern money is \ncreated out of nothing in this day and age, and so making more and giving \nit out to fix the world rasher than stunt it surely can work if thought out \ncarefully.  Yes not everyone can be filthy rich, lest the world be consumed \nall the faster (another and intricately linked problem in and of itself) \nbut surely poverty, disease, epidemic/pandemic, wars. etc., are by no means \na solution, and take their root in an unfair distribution of wealth as it \nis.\n\n  This idea of basic income, or something strikingly similar, Will become \nreality, for if not, there will only result the inevitable and eventual \nINCREASE of crime, instability, rioting, etc., and indeed even witch-hunts \nagainst the mega rich elitists themselves.  It has happened before.  Haiti, \nanyone?  Ancient Rome?  And I am not saying I myself want to start a \nviolent revolt, but the idea is in the minds and hearts of many already, \nsilently stirring.  Survival instincts can be very strong, and everyone has \nthe right to exist.\n\n  A peaceful demand, a-la Gandhi style, is what will push this noble agenda \nforward, but those who have seats of \"power\" would do well to truly \nconsider such a wonderful humanitarian proposal before it would even come \nto that.  What intelligence and grace, and respect for people, the planet, \nand the very future, if this would be implemented very soon, for the very \nbenefit of ALL involved.\n\n Peace and Health, and may the increase of this beautiful idea spread.\n  \n \ufeff",

It works basically like this:  Step 1. Eliminate all \nexisting forms of welfare, eg. food assistance, housing assistance, family \naid, social security, etc.  Step 2. Eliminate all Tax deductions, eg no \nmore personal exemption, mortgage interest deduction, earned income tax \ncredit, etc.  Step 3.  All EARNED Income will be taxable, continuing to use \na progressive tax model. Step 4.  Use freed up and new revenue (from \nelimination of deductions) to create Universal Income Guarantee, equal to \nthe poverty rate.  In the U.S., this would be about 12,000 per year, or \n1000 per month.  This income would be Individual (every adult citizen is \nentitled), Unconditional (No constraints on how you spend it), and \nUniversal  (everyone would get it, whether rich or poor, married or \nunmarried, employed or unemployed.)  One of the huge benefits of this model \nis that it removes the negative incentives (the incentive not to work \ncreated by tying welfare payments to income level) and the sense that \nothers are getting more than anyone else.  It also has the added benefit of \ncompletely eliminating poverty and greatly reducing wealth inequality. \n This really isn't a Utopian dream, a lot of economists have been talking \nabout it lately as the only hope for saving industrialized economies.",

(I fully predict that call centers will have to be \nautomated. I have never met a single person who didn't loathe call center \nwork.)\n\nThen? An explosion of art, music, films and books.

There may be more geniuses (genii?) \nthan we expected - they were just stuck behind deep fryers or desks in \ndead-end jobs that wasted their intellect and talents.)\n\nAnd later? Well, the sky's the limit really. Once there is no threat of \npoverty for devoting time to your passions and dreams (or to keeping \nyourself healthy) instead of working - once that's no longer an either/or \nchoice - our societies will be so much happier and healthier. \n\n(And more productive.

But let's look into it.\nLet's first acknowledge that you're right; people scam the current system. \nWhy? because it's less labor than actually working. With basic income, no \nlabor is required to get it. People than stand before a choice; life with \nthat money, work, or scam the system. The kind of scamming to propose is \nvery labor intensive. Keeping up a lie, transferring, infiltration etc. But \nthe key difference with the current system is; the is no need to do it. It \nwill only be those that are willing to give up time and effort in order to \ngain more than what is needed to live.\nAs for the children, I don't know whether children should be given some \nmoney. None of the experiments I've read had increased birth rates, though \ninfant mortality went down. Most experiment gave  to everyone of legal \nadulthood (18 often) the money and some gave children half through their \nparents. This isn't like the industrial ages where one man couldn't provide \nenough for it's family.\n\nThe incentive to get more is different than the incentive to get enough, \nyou'll have to realize that.",

            "text": "Funny, I've found that everyone in my life who has a lot of money and few \nworking hours is ridiculously productive. (A couple of my relatives made \nsmart investments in property while they were young; they're quite elderly \nnow and are not only ludicrously active for it, but healthy, happy, and \ninvolved in their communities.)\n\nEveryone I know who works full-time? Lazy. As. Fuck. One of my friends went \na week without doing the dishes or cleaning because she just could not be \narsed with it after work. A lot of them eat takeout even though they know \nit's unhealthy because cooking is just too much effort. But even think the \nwords 'quit your job' in front of them and it's freakout city. And heck, \neven casual workers are lazy - because the work is exhausting, and it's \nexhausting to be stuck in a place for 4-8 hours with people you hate, \ndealing with asshole customers, and not being able to leave. (And that's \none job - think about the people who work 2 or 3 casual jobs. Some of them \nare lucky to sleep at all, much less have free time.)\n\nToo many of us revise and destroy our dreams and our creativity and ideas \nbecause these are things that only the rich get to have. Writing is for \nthose who have enough money to live on and time to do it in. Politicians \ndon't get paid until they're elected, so only those who can live \npotentially for years with no income get to be politicians. The stereotype \nof the 'starving artists' still holds true and it's not desirable to have \nto sacrifice your health for your art because you can only have one of \nthose things. (I could write thousands of words on all the things wrong \nwith glamorizing youth and student poverty.) How many brilliant minds stay \nuntapped because they're stuck behind a deep fryer or a phone in a call \ncenter? How many amazing businesses don't exist because their founder is \ntoo afraid of unemployment to quit their job in order to start them?\n\nThe way society forces us to choose between knowledge, creativity, or \ndecent living has always made me angry. A basic income removes that - you \ndon't have to choose between studying, creating, and still being able to \nkeep a roof over your head and food on the table. \n\nAnd for many of us unemployed? Some extra money would help with that whole \n'getting a job' thing. Good interview clothes don't come cheaply. Neither \ndo toiletries so you don't stink or look like a hobo in there. Cars, bus \ntickets, these are not cheap but they are require to get to interviews and \njobs. And most of the time now, you need a computer and Internet to apply \nfor jobs - also not cheap. You need a mobile phone for callbacks - some \nplans aren't too bad but it's still an expense. And that's on top of the \nusual food, rent, bills. Extreme poverty is actually a barrier to \nemployment - because people cannot afford the things they need to find jobs \nwith. So getting people out of that will help them find jobs. (And given \nthat a basic income would give people to freedom to do things like starting \nbusinesses, it'll also fuel job creation far more effectively than tax \nbreaks for billionaires ever could.)",

I'm 42 and paid over $130,000 to social security so far in my life. \nI'll never see the 300k+ that I will probably wind up paying. We threw \nBernie Madoff in jail for running a ponzi scheme. The governments system \nclearing isn't working. Why should my money not go into an account with my \nname on it? The large amount of 65+ year old people living today will screw \nit up for 10s of millions in the future. I came across this statistic \nrecently.
