The \nother one...well she turned the sink into a dumpster for weeks, didn't take \nout trash bags until I told her several times, and secretly drank my Brita \nand failed to fill it up multiple times. One thing I still don't understand \nis why she never washed her little tower for the whole academic year. I \nmean c'mon that's freaking gross and it can cause eye infections or more \npimples!!! The last thing that got on my nerves was when she ignored my \nwarning about the school placing penalty fee for small paint smudges on the \nwall. Well, we three all got charged and this problem could have been \navoided if she just cleaned that bloody wall! Remember kids, the toilet \npaper issue can also turn into a nightmare. If you're neat and organized \nyou might have bigger trouble finding neat and organized folks. Oh and \nreligious differences can spark conflicts and I did see some brewing \ntensions between Catholic and Protestant students because of some minor \ntheological arguments. It's always unwise to criticize someone based on his \nor her religious beliefs because that certainly is one of the main reasons \nwhy so many people verbally and physically destroy each other.\ufeff",
