Dyno rooms are different, so to make sure \nthat things are equal, SAE International has developed a standard for what \nthe air density (Elevation), barometric pressure, temp and other variables \nmust be, and corrected for if not so. If for example, the temperature of a \ndyno room and the altitude is different than what is specified in the J1349 \nstandard, the \"raw\" number of the dyno pull must then be corrected \naccordingly. The document I'm talking about, is simply a dynosheet \nverifying that the test was done in accordance with SAE J1349 Certified \nPower guidelines. Why I'm bringing this up, is because if what is known as \nthe J507 Land And Sea correction standard is used, the hp number the engine \nputs out, will be about 5-6% higher than if corrected by the J1349 \nstandard. I can't remember the correction factors off the top of my head, \nbut I remember that the temperature for a J1349 test should be corrected \nfor 70 degrees F and the J507 only for 60 degrees F. In other words, the \nJ1349 is more conservative than the J507. Some dyno shops even just use \nrandom correction factors, which basically makes the measured power number \ncompletely useless.\nIf you want to know more about the J1349 Certified Power and other similar \nstandards, read this.\nhttp://www.sae.org/certifiedpower/details.htm",

In DMK, you get 3+ weeks paid vacation and public healthcare at \nsomeone elses expense. That's the law. What worldwide fortune 100 companies \nreside in DMK?  In the Silicon Valley (about 5 hours North of LA) there are \nmore global companies in one place than in most countries. This is a good \nreason why things are \"inexpensive\" here, more so than other places. I am \nnot defending the US prices, and in fact, I am sympathetic to the costs in \nDMK for your cost of living. It's how your people have voted, and now you \nhave no incentive to dream about a cool car like this (however you have a \nsafe, clean place that is efficient with what resources it has). I wouldn't \nconsider an AMG E63 at $500K US.  Its just not that cool. ",
