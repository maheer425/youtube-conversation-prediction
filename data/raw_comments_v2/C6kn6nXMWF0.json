The 4th dimension is going forward \nand backwards in time. Time is like a bunch of 3d frames of us occurring \nsort of like a flip book. ( e.g. tesseract).

And to say when/where something is in said \ndimension you would need a number to describe it.\n\nFor a line you just need 1 number, think of a linear coordinate system, or \nwhen you say something is x meters long. The more dimensions you add the \nmore numbers you need to tell the sate of said object. If you have 2 \ndimensions you need 2 numbers. Think of a chess board, or a game of \"sink\" \nthe ship\". For 3 dimensions, you would add a number for the height.\nNow a fourth dimension can not be represented in our 3-dimensional space, \nbecause geometrically there is no direction at a right angle to all other \ndirections. So lets say as before we represent it with a number.\nThen, you could for example say in which state your object is in a 4-th \ndimension without having to picture it.\nIf we say time is another dimension we could say in which state we are with \n4 numbers.

So maybe there really is no 4 \ndimensions, but rather it all comes down to how we look at it instead.  \n\nFor something to be 1 or 2 dimensional, is technically impossible.  That \nflat square has to have height, otherwise it functionally has zero data, \nand zero interaction, meaning it doesn't exist.  After all, in order to \neven discern another '2D' object in a 2D world, the object has to have a \ntop and a bottom to discern what it is from the side.  If it doesn't, then \nit effectively has zero volume, and again, does not exist.....even to other \n2D objects....which also wouldn't exist anyways....and in fact, can not \nexist, even outside of the sense of us perceiving it or not.  \n\nNo one has yet to say exactly what effect or property the 4th dimension \ncould be having, other than it's defined by some extra volume in some \ndirection. Well, every direction is possible in space, so exactly what \ndirection is this extra dimension going?  On top of that, what type of \nmatter is filling this direction, and how is it interacting with the other \n3 directions?  \n\nAfter all, anything in 4 dimension, would have to be anchored in 3 \ndimensions.\n\nLet's say for example, gravity is a result of the 4th dimension.  But in \nthe end, all it is, is a property of matter, in 3 dimensions.  \n\nOne issue is we would most likely be observing more unexplained actions, \nsince all 3D matter would be routed in 4D.  for example, if you slid a 3D \ncube across the table, it would still appear to move to the 2D \nobject.....seemingly on its own. \ufeff",

Dimensions go in right \nangles of each other. 1d goes one direction then back like a line. 2d goes \n4 directions on a flat plane (e.g. left, right, forward and back). 3d goes \nleft, right, forward, back, up and down. The 4th dimension is going forward \nand backwards in time. Time is like a bunch of 3d frames of us occurring \nsort of like a flip book. ( e.g. tesseract). We only see a frame at a time, \na cross section of time. A 4d person can see all the frames from beginning \nto end at once. Time no longer becomes an obstacle it becomes a direction.",
