Both of their achievements \nare quite similar honestly, except Alexander did all that about 1500 years \nbefore Khan. Aside from that, what makes Alexander's name derive \nconsiderably more scorn and hostility?\n\nI find the idea of calling a blood thirsty warmonger merciful ludicrous, \nbut in comparison Alexander didn't massacre villages to gain a \npsychological edge on the enemy. When it comes down to it, the battles of \nAlexander the great resulted in say about half a million deaths as sort of \nupper number. Genghis khan on the other hand, sources put 20 million deaths \nas a low ball estimate of the total amount of people he killed.None of \nthese people are particularly likeable figures in my eyes and they are both \npretty worthy of scorn if you ask me, but are you really going to look over \nthe massive slaughter done by Genghis khan in the name of fighting Euro \ncentrism?\n\nWhy is Ghengis ok, but Alexander not so? Because it really is worrying and \nmakes you look pretty hypocritical and biased. I applaud you fighting euro \ncentrism, but excusing the doings of Genghis khan for the sake of fighting \neuro centrism is asinine. biased. Your extreme anti-European bias cheapens \nthe entirety of your series. If your going to be hard on a figure like \nAlexander the Great, Genghis khan and his empire deserve the same \ntreatment, no? Why glorify the Mongols so much? Why ignore the sick \ndestruction they wrought? I've noticed you're fairly scornful of warmongers \nin your series, except in this case where you seem quite enraptured with \nGenghis khan who is rightfully the most violent and bloodthirsty of all \nthem, you even went into a bit more detail in their tactics and strategy, \nsomething you failed to do for similar figures.\n\nAfter all that, I still enjoy your series and my complaint is really not a \nlarge one, but it'd be nice if you were at least consistent with your \ndiscouragement of \"great man\" history and warmongers\ufeff",

Examples: \nNon-linear PDEs (Partial Differential Equations), coupled discrete \nequations, numerical methods, non-integrable geometric functions, chaotic \nyet possibly fractal turbulence functions!... I could keep going but \ninstead I'll say calculus might not be that hard in its simplified high \nschool/college form, but it's a complete bear in the hard engineering \nfields.\n\nBut, on the other hand, the world needs more engineers. So if you actually \nfind diff eq easy, try to solve the Navier-Stokes Millennium prize, cause \nthat solution would be super helpful for my (and many other people's) \nresearch.",
