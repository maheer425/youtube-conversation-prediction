His role-prep for getting into the mind of \"Vincent\" was impressive. \nThe pistol training was done under the guidance of former Special Air \nService soldier Michael Gould, and it shows here. Collateral is a movie \nwhich drips with cool. This scene is classic. The first two guys quickly \nlooked at Max's hands tied to the wheel, realised something wasn't right \nand walked on. The second two guys getting up in Vincent's face, thinking \nhe was an easy mug...not realising they're trying to screw with a contract \nkiller. \"What else you got for me...huh?\" A swift knockdown into the \nafterlife from a H&K USP!

I know, I gotta change it. 1. you can't \nhave something that is both communist and capitalist. That is ridiculous. \n2. Communism in it's purest form is a classless and stateless society in \nwhich all means of production are owned by the community. I think you \nconfuse communism and socialism. If you think the US is socialist you are \nwrong. For it to be socialist the government needs to own are regulate all \nmeans of production. Which, in the US, it doesn't. Now, that doesn't mean \nthe US is 100% capitalist. You know what is? Mexico. You can see how well \nthat's going for them. The US is and always has been teetering between \nsocialist and capitalist. It will still always be capitalist because of the \nway we see economics in the US. Right now it is teetering closer to the \nsocialist side then most other times (except probably the new deal) But \nthis tends to happens when we have democrats in office. I am a socialist. \nBut I don't think it should be forced world wide. I do not believe the US \ncan ever become socialist because with our current political system, Fabian \nsocialism can not be reached. Now. Explain why I'm wrong. GO!",
