            "text": "+McJuggerNuggets Hey bro, i'm glad it all been sorted out. but your dad \nhave a bit of point! You are still living under his roof. The least you \ncould do was to help him with his job, if my parents asks me to do anything \ni would do it. if they would say i should work, i would have got a job at \nMcDonald's or anything. you dont need to work 12 hours a day and get a back \npain from it or anything. just support Ur home with money, cleaning \nanything bro. but i'm really glad that you and dad got over a deal. BTW if \nmy brother did that to me, i would have already kicked his ass, even though \ni'm not strong enough to beat MY older brother i would have stood up for my \nself and showed him. Damn Ur brother is a jerk and i hope, Karma strikes \nback. Been watching your videos for a few hours now. at first i got \nentertained, but after a while i feelt sad and loneliness. Someone who \nloves doing what he's doing should not be taken from him. BUT atleast help \nyour dad out with a smile on your face. because he was the one who raised \nyou.And he was the one who brought you to this earth, HE was the one who \nbrought food on the table, he's the one who's been educateing you. but he \nwas still doing it wrong haha. like you said in this video! \"if you were a \nunderstanding father you would have understood.\" But no. he didnt. So, tell \nyour dad he has a point. Because in the end, when he's not there. what \nwould you have done? I mean my parents educated me with beating haha. and \nthats normal in arab familys but still. i love my parents i would do \nanything for them, but sometimes they actually can do stuff or say stuff \nthat pisses me off. SO your dad is RIGHT and also are you my friend! so \nreally! take care of yourself and ur family, because in the end what really \nmatters is your blood aka your family! Please thumps up this so he can see \nit!\ufeff",
