If the plan is to buy the car, throw a few bolt-ons \nand a tune at it, you missed the point of this car. An enthusiast can buy \nan Ecoboost, throw a couple of grand at it and have a car that outperforms \nthe GT and gets better fuel mileage for less money. Will it still be \nmissing the V8 noise? Yes.

While not the sheer apostasy of a Mustang \nII, it is an entirely mistaken concept. I don't really care for the \nperspective of the test, either. The entry level Mustang, formerly the 6 \ncylinder, was not designed or sold as a track car, so why bother taking it \nto Willow Springs...3600 lbs. absurd weight, automatic (why even bother \ntesting it with that transmission?)-I'm just vexed by the whole thing. Ford \nis playing other companies' game...I had a 2011 V6 with aftermarket \nexhaust. The car did everything I wanted out of it. 6 speed, good shift \nfeel, it tore off the line and had real grunt that made me smile every \ntime. It had a wonderful visceral quality that no one discusses in this \nreview...the sound. Although it was not a V8, it sounded like an old Aston \nMartin race car or one of those ealy 70s Capri racers. A four cylinder will \nnever make you feel that way. Even with the stupid limiter on the old \nMustang, it was still great. I used it for exactly what I wanted out of \nit...not a track car, not a street racer, just something that looked great, \nsounded great every time I got into it. I looked at the GT and realized \nthat it is just so hard to really use a car on public roads. If I really \nwant to drive fast, I want something that is going to be more rewarding on \nthe track. An independent rear suspension Boss 302 with some big brembos \ndoes sound fun, but that's another story. I think the 4 cylinder is fine \nfor drivers who just want the look of the car, or Hertz. The 6 can give you \nsomething that is quite a bit more alive.\nBeyond the motor, the car's lines are so unpleasantly Japanese...somehow \nreminiscent of a Celica now. Again, playing the game by other companies' \nrules...I would be much more interested in a BRZ, or a Hyundai Genesis 6 \ncylinder than this sad iteration of a Mustang. It does not have to be \narchaic, but there was so much more room to flesh out the distinctive \nthrowback looks. I could happily concede some style points for a flat crank \nV8 with this body, but that I4, 3600 lbs. and body together is just nothing \nI would spend money on. \ufeff",
