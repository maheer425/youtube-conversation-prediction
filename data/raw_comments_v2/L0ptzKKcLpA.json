My car has \nbeen egged 4 times and the rear side glass had a rock thrown through it. I \nlove muscle cars, but the people I've seen with them aren't too friendly \nand are ignorant. So that is where I drew my conclusion. I guess when you \nhaven't been in somebody else's shoes you can't appreciate the way they \nwalk. Sorry soulburn. Maybe you're different. I'll never know.
