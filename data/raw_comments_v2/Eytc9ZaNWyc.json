That, again, is \npurely opinion, and again it was taught as fact.

Many Americans don't or can't make a \ndistinction between the American Revolution and the War for independence, \nand they have the freedom to do so, even if it to their detriment, and they \nare not unpatriotic for doing so, where as in pre WWII Japan there was no \nchoice but to boldly declare that the Emperor was a direct descendant of \nthe Sun God or to be considered treasonous. That is Facism, I suggest you \nlook up what the term means. His use of purportedly and liberties is based \naround perspective, recognizing that the act was purportedly oppressive \nbecause point of view determines if it's oppressive or not, (the English \ncertainly didn't think it was oppressive and English watchers might still \nthink so and he is recognizing that view and being neutral) and that while \nthe word \"liberties\" is clearly used in print, the context that it's the \n\"liberty\" to smuggle puts it beyond the traditional liberties you espouse. \nIn the end, these ARE abstract ideas that will differ from person to person \nand his neutral positioning and allowing for each person to make up their \nown mind about what constitutes oppression or a liberty without forcing an \nidea down your throat is the sign of a good teacher and a good American.",

The Quartering Act was actually passed in 1765, but \nseldom was used because there weren't enough British regulars in the \ncolonies to overflow the existing barracks.  After the Intolerable Acts, \nalso known as the Coercive Acts (Boston Harbor shut down, harsh taxes, \npayment demanded for the Boston Tea Party) were passed though, the peace \nwas often disturbed in cities on the Eastern sea board.  This caused an \ninflux of British regulars that needed to be housed in civilian quarters \nbecause the barracks were not large enough, calling upon the Quartering Act \nthat had so long lain dormant.

            "text": "Just looked it up,there was quite a bit of loyalist support in NY as well \nbecause of the aristocratic history but also a lot of support for the \nPatriots because of the commerciality (even then it was a trade hub) but \nGeorgia also had quite a bit of support for the Tories. There was really \nonly one place Britain didn't have strong support and that was a place with \na lot of congregationalists from New England(where most of the rebels \nwere.) It took quite a bit to get them on our side. They had the highest \npercentage of loyalists of all the colonies and some of their leaders, (who \nwould come over to our side) supported the British as late as 1774 when \nthey wrote and signed a document supporting the British crown. They \nactually didn't even announce support for the revolution until January of \n1776 when the war had been going on for 10 months already. They would send \n3 delegates to the 2nd Continental Congress though and all 3 would sign the \nDeclaration of Independence but Georgia was the only state completely \ncaptured by the British and it was used as an attacking point against the \nNorth in what Britain called \"The Southern Strategy\"",
