The american government however made \na mistake they assumed the Canadian colonies would love to \"throw off the \nchains of British rule\" However they quite liked the British system and \nfought back allied with the natives (tecumseh is the name of their leader) \nwe won several small victories and never really lost any territory during \nthe war we held off many major attacks on land (the Americans won a naval \nconflict with \"old iron sides\") and then in 1815 the Having defeated \nNapoleon the British were able to turn their full attention to the conflict \nand quickly beat the states. However during the agreement talks the \n\"Canadians\" wanted to give the natives their own private country to be free \non given that their land was being taken by settlers and what not the \nAmericans disagreed to the terms  because Napoleon had risen again and \nBritain had to chose its battles so Britain made a quick decision and let \nthe war end with both sides going back to having pretty much the same \nboarders as they use to. A \"major victory\" taught to many Americans in some \nschools is the \"final naval engagement of the war,\" in which the American \nsloop Peacock fired on and seriously damaged the British brig Nautilus in \nthe Straits of Sunda off Java. The British captain, Lieutenant Charles \nBoyce informed the commander of the American ship that the Treaty of Ghent \nending the war had been signed on December 24, 1814, but the Americans \nopened fire anyway.  So yeah that's my rant but yeah all i know is Canada \nseems to be the only major country looking at the war anymore mainly \nbecause to the rest of the world the years 1812-1815 as Napoleonic war time \nand america generally doesn't like to talk about its loses as far as I know.",
