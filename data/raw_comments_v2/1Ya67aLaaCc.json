            "text": "Too many self centered, pathetic losers in the world who \"need\" (there is \nno actual need for any of it) porn to get off. They end up ignoring real \nwomen, they become more demanding and superficial thinking natural, real \nwomen are less attractive, and waste a lot of time on this sickness. People \nstart to accept too much and it becomes a loose society. Porn is a \ndisgusting thing that should be eradicated - not supported or defended. \nThere's not enough love or good morals in the world. Porn doesn't \ncontribute to anything positive in a relationship. At least I will never \naccept a guy who watches it, it's a real turn-off. Also, it only glorifies \nwhores, giving them what they want - easy money. I thought men didn't like \ngolddigging whores. Oh, but I guess it doesn't prevent them from \nwatching/using/paying them... Which makes those men worse than the whores, \nalways. If you watch porn, you better never complain again when your GF is \nproving to be a golddigger.\ufeff",
