I want to say Big Ups to BigHit Entertainment. You all continue to \nastound us with the artists that you put out. \"Cough..Cough...BTS\" \n\n2. This video was made over the summer but I just saw it pop up in my \nYoutube feed this morning. Took a look at it and I love it! The song is \ncatchy. The artist have really nice voices and TA DA.....They used a model \nof color in the video. Finally something other than just Russian models!\n\nThat being said, damn near every time I see a Korean artist using a black \nwoman in a video, I always see some fangirls, who I can only assume may be \nasian...I could be wrong...... whose brains have just exploded, start \nmaking negative comments. The most common one is....\" black models in \nKorean videos are always portrayed as the ho...\"\n\nExcuse me?????\n\nThe girls in the BTS video that they did as an assignment on their American \nLife series were not portrayed as hoes. The black women in Rain's La video \nwere not portrayed as hoes. And the woman in this video was not portrayed \nas a hoe either. \n\nSo what exactly are you really trying to say? It's ok for us to like the \nvideos, buy the merchandise and support the artist but we better not ever \nthink we can be portrayed positively in any of their videos? \n\nThe fuck out of here with that Bullshit!!!\n\nYa'll need to get over yourselves, grow the fuck up and understand.....Kpop \nis no longer just a Korean or Asian thing. It's an international movement. \nIt has no boundaries. Music has no boundaries. Hell, pretty soon we'll \nprobably be seeing some of our Latina or Indian sisters in videos. \n\nNow, when they do their live shows at home, that's a different story. I \nunderstand they have to go with whatever the network will allow. That's sad \nbut it's to be expected. But hurry up and believe, I for one will not sit \nback and let anyone label all of us as hoes just because of your limited \nexposure to our culture. \n\nThere. That's my two cents.\n\nLove you BigHit. Keep em coming.....\n\n+PsychoMalkavian42 +Alisha Bacon +Helen V +Chris Sol88Sun +Chantal Espinosa \n+M Smith +Ms. Mik +Nancy V.I.P Nonocasper \ub0b8\uc2dc +Angel Eyes +Eyxaful +Cassandra \n\uce74\uc0b0\ub4dc\ub77c +rose melody +Mary Revette \ufeff",

Pour Les Femmes is their first album as a \nduet.\n\nHomme has a unique Contemporary Jazz sound that's just awesome. The blend \nof their voices is perfect.\n\nA couple of their songs carry a feel of what can be considered a fusion \nbetween Pharrel, Robin Thicke, and Andre 3000. And then there's \ub2c8\uac00 \uadf8\ub9ac\uc62c \ub9ac\uc5c6\uc5b4, \na definite favourite, which lends itself to the Brooklyn-style Sunday-choir \nsound.\ufeff",
