However, I must say that I liked \nThe Catcher in the Rye, and that it DOES have a motive and a plot.\n\nNo action? Perhaps. A cyclical, or even short, stopped plot? Perhaps. But \nit does have a plot. Problem is that nothing out of the common happens. \nNothing spectacular or \"revealing\" happens at any given time. It's just \nlike life itself: in most novels, you have a moment of miracle, of \nepiphany, in which characters, and readers through them, find out some \nessential truth. Some sort of \"revelation\". That revelation doesn't happen \nin this novel, or, at least, doesn't happen directly, nor explicitly and \nnot at all suddenly, but it does happen throughout the novel itself.\n\nIn life, most of the days go by without nothing particularly new \nor important happening. Most of our stages in life are just a series of \ndays, weeks, months or even years in which we do the same stuff over and \nover again, and nothing changes. And it comforts us knowing that. Then, \nwhen we go watching movies and reading books and we look for those \nexciting, miraculous, visibly crafted stories. That's what's great and \nwrong with The Catcher in the Rye: it doesn't appear to be crafted. It \nlooks more like a diary, like... real life.",
