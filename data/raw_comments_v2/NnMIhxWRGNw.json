            "text": "+Rick Baartman A) Einstein may have regretted it, but a fact is that in the \nformulation of his famous formula he used it in that way. So, this video \n incorrectly suggests that Einstein's formula is incomplete.\n\n(Btw, the article  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_in_special_relativity \n I mentioned already in my earlier response.)\n\nB) When the Newtonian mechanics was extended to Einstein's relativity \n(\"extended\" I mean in the sense that in Newton's theory velocity is already \nrelative in mechanics, but Einstein extended it by including optics in the \nrelativity, so that the velocity of light became invariant), in the \nbeginning of the previous century, the notion of mass could be extended in \ntwo ways. The first possibility was to keep the mass as a relation between \nforce and acceleration (inertial mass) and as the source of the gravitation \nforce (gravitation mass). This leads to what is called the relativistic \nmass. The other possibility is to take the mass as an invariant property of \nan object, which leads to what is called rest-mass.\nBoth possibilities have there advantages and their disadvantages. Using the \nfirst possibility many formulas can be taken from classical mechanics \nunmodified, but with the understanding that mass is the relativistic mass. \nAn example is the formula for the cyclotron frequency (\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotron). In addition, at least for me, it \nfits better with the classical meanings of mass (inertial mass and \ngravitational mass).\n\nC) Einstein's formula is interpreted as the equivalence of mass and energy. \nTherefore, sometimes the terms rest-energy and relativistic energy are also \nused. The same objection against the term relativistic mass can also be \nused for the term relativistic energy. It is not invariant, etc.\n\nD) I understand that if there are two notions (1 rest mass/energy and 2 \nrelativistic mass/energy) and both have two names with two prefixes, that \nthe terminology could be improved if one term (mass) is used for one thing \n(rest mass) and energy for the other one (relativistic energy), so that the \nprefixes could be dropped. Alas, as long as only a minority of the \nphysicists use this convention and the majority keeps using it in other \nways, the misunderstanding will remain.\n\nF) My conclusion is that it all comes down to convention and terminology. I \ndon't think that we disagree concerning the meaning of Einstein's formula. \nOr do you really think that Einstein meant the rest-mass when he published \nhis formula? It is clear that with m he meant the relativistic mass. If you \ndon't want to call it a mass, but you want to give it a different name, \nthat is not a problem for me, but I have not yet seen such a different name \nin this discussion.",

For me they are a sign that \nyou find your own argument on the subject itself not strong enough. If you \ncontinue with these personal attacks, I will just stop the discussion.\nc) I think that we have a problem with terminology. You understand mass \nonly as invariant mass, or rest-mass, or zero-velocity mass, whereas you \nignore the fact that the term mass is also often used for the full mass \nthat increases with the velocity. Often the zero-velocity mass is indicated \nwith m0 (0 as a subscript). Most people understand from the context which \nof the two possible meanings of the word mass, or the symbol m is intended. \nOften when the context is ambiguous, the word mass is prefixed with \ninvariant, rest, total, full, relativistic, or other terms. \nFrom the context it is clear that Einstein in his formula meant the total \nmass, not the invariant mass, because, then it tells the full story, if \nnot, the formula is incomplete and additional terms are needed which makes \nthe formula unnecessary complicated and less elegant.\nd) Also in other formulas, the symbol m is used for the total mass. See, \ne.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotron. (Here you also see what I \nmeant with the difference between m and m subscript 0) Don't tell me that \nthis is an out-dated article..\ne) Gravitation acts on the mass. A photon has rest-mass zero. Still, it is \nsubject to gravitational attraction. This shows that also the gravitational \nmass is used in the sense of total mass, not zero-velocity-mass.\nf) You may be surprised that in such an exact field as physics, some terms \nhave more than one use. But also physicists use common day language. It is \nvery well possible that some physicists have tried to define a more exact \nterminology, of which your quotations could be an example, but they did not \nsucceed.\ng) My conclusion is that the whole difference of opinion comes down to \nterminology. By misunderstanding of the terminology and of the symbol m, \nthis video makes the wrong claim that Einstein's formula is incomplete. If \nit were understood that the m in Einstein's formula stands for the total \nmass (you may name it differently, if you don't like the term mass here, \nbut I don't know another name), than the whole video would not have been \nmade.",

So \nthen: *p* = m * d *x*/d\u03c4\nwith \u03c4 as the proper time (the time measured in the frame of the particle). \nEvery observer will agree on this momentum, since everybody can agree on \nthe rest frame of the particle ;) So this momentum is well defined.\n\nBut you want to know the particle momentum in *your* frame of reference. So \nwe write:\n*p* = m * d *x*/dt * dt/d\u03c4\nIt looks like this is just a multiplication with dt/dt but in reality it is \nthe chain-rule from calculus.\nAgain: d *x*/dt is the velocity of the particle *v* as measured by you. But \nwe also need to evaluate dt/d\u03c4.\nYou may remember that in special relativity t = \u03b3 * \u03c4 holds. So: dt/d\u03c4 = \u03b3 \nleading to:\n*p* = \u03b3 * m * *v*\nwith \u03b3 = 1/sqrt(1-*v*\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nIf we compare that to *p* = m * *v*, we find that our classical formula is \naccurate for small *v* (the limes of 1/sqrt(1-*v*\u00b2/c\u00b2) for | *v* | -> 0 is \n1; | *v* | is the absolute value of *v*). As a rule of thumb we could say, \nfor instance, that we are fine with using the classical formula, as long as \nthe difference between the exact result and the classical result is below, \nlet's say 0.5 %.

            "text": "Well, it's a little more complicated than that. The full formula is:\nE\u00b2=m\u00b2c^4 + p\u00b2c\u00b2\n\nSo if you have a massive body that has almost no momentum in a particular \nreference frame, then m\u00b2c^4 is much larger than p\u00b2c\u00b2 for that body. And its \nenergy can be well approximated by E = mc\u00b2.\nIn the opposite case: if you have an object with a large momentum in \ncomparison to its rest mass, like a light particle moving very fast or a \nphoton (with 0 rest mass), then p\u00b2c\u00b2 is much larger than m\u00b2c^4 and it's \nenergy can be approximated by E = pc.\n\nAnd while it is possible to always find a frame of reference in which a \ncertain object does not move (except when that object has no mass - then it \ngets really complicated) and therefore has p = 0 and E is exactly mc\u00b2, \nobjects that do have a rest mass cannot loose it all the sudden. So if you \nhave a massive object, no matter how big you make pc, mc\u00b2 always will \ncontribute a tiny little bit, causing E to always be a larger than pc. The \nexception, of course, are again particles without a rest mass (like light) \nfor which E is always exactly pc.\n\nDoes that help a little?",
