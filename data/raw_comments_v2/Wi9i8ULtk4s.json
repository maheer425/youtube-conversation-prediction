If some people's pee doesn't smell bad, \none possibility is that they are utilizing it somehow. This would explain \n\u201cwhere it goes.\u201d Let's keep digging.\n\n* If somebody eats asparagus frequently for a prolonged period, does their \npee still smell (or still not smell, as the case may be) after a year? Did \nthe various studies check different age groups, ethnicities, cultural \ndiets, etc, etc? There are many unresolved questions begging to be answered.\n\nAgain, that stuff is in there for a purpose. Let's find out what it is. \nBecause I really like asparagus and would like to put it back on the menu. \nBut I'm not doing so without good reason because I can't stand to be in the \nbathroom with myself after eating it.\ufeff",
