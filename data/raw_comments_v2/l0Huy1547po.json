Quite \nobviously, the husband is the driving factor here, but did the wife not \nexpress her concerns prior to heading out? There are things to look at \nbeyond just hiking out into the bush and pitching a tent. \n\nSolar power would have solved the whole light issue, and it's not exactly \nexpensive anymore. you can be off grid and still have electricity. \n\nAs for the rifle, and not knowing how to use it... what? Why the hell would \nanyone think it's okay to move out into the wilderness, and first, not have \na rifle for protection against wild animals such as bears (you are living \nin their home after all, and they're not Winnie the frigging Poo), and two, \nfinally get one and have NO IDEA how to use it?\n\nThis amounts to an incredible amount of poor planning, and naivety. Good on \nthem for sticking with it, but holy cow. Education and research before \ntaking on something of this magnitude.\ufeff",
