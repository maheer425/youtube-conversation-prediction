            "text": "On the subject of change and progress, I think about the coming \nroboticization of over half our jobs and how that change would affect us. \ncheerleaders of the roboticized future claim that it would lead to an age \nwhere he'd be able to focus on more creative endeavors rather than spending \ntime having to work for a living. but would that really be the case for \neveryone?\n\nlet's be real here, this isn't going to be an instantaneous process, robots \nwill slowly be introduced into various fields, running people into \nunemployment, creeping up poverty rates as the already competitive job \nmarket get's even tighter, and more people will be greatly hurt for it than \nhelped. even if they try to apply their abilities to other jobs. there's \nstill higher competition from others that did the same, and who's to say a \nrobot can't be placed there before long also?\n\nCapitalism as we know it will not function in a society where half the jobs \nare gone, and only the most intellectual, most creative, or robot centric \njobs will exist. it would prohibit young people from ever getting anywhere, \nand send income mobility to a screeching halt. I hear some say that we \ncould enact a living allowance so that people don't have to work to \nsurvive, but could pursue these high end jobs to enhance their quality of \nlife. but this practice is incredibly socialist in nature. and americans \nhave an intense allergy to all things socialist.\n\nI doubt the wealthiest, or even members of the republican party in general \nwould be willing to accept the idea of a living allowance as it might \ndevalue their wealth in some way, and feed their fears of a lazy and \nunaccomplished america. not to mention, where is this money coming from? if \nthrough taxes then there's no way the wealthy and the republican party \nwould stand for such a change since it would look as if the fruits of their \naccomplishments are being distributed towards those that don't contribute \nor achieve as much as they did.\n\nAlso, a few of the benefits of a roboticized future seem like what I refer \nto as \"value assumptions\", or predictions upon events that heavily depend \non human ideal and nature, stating a behavior trend as a factual outcome. \nKinda like saying that supply side economics would lead business owners to \ncreate more jobs. even though one would wonder why spend more money when \nthe workers you have get the job done just fine?\n\nI don't feel that the extinguished labor costs that come with robots will \nimmediately preclude to price reductions. if people are still willing to by \na product for 10 bucks, producers may still just sell it for 10 bucks even \nif the reduced labor costs should bring it down to 6 or 4 bucks.\n\nNow my value assumptions go under the idea that businesses and producers \noperate on greed, and strategically aim for raising profits as high as \npossible while avoiding legal trouble. but I've only seen Costco as being \nthe sole potential exception to this.\n\nBut am I too assuming when I say that we'd be resistant to more socialist \npractices to accommodate for a roboticized future? would it all even be \nnecessary to engage in a rotobicized future without leaving hundreds of \npeople in the dust with no way to pick themselves up?\ufeff",

More specifically, rich farmers were \nbuying up (consolidating) land and that resulted in a huge loss of land and \njobs for farmers. They then emigrated to the cities, and worked low wage \njobs. Eventually leading to the Industrial Revolution. I feel that the \nrobotic future is very bright. It would lead to job loss, but that would \njust mean more people available for other things, At the end of the day, \nhumans will still have to manage companies, secure deals, cook food.\n\nWorst case scenario, humans are phased out in which case corporate profits \nwill skyrocket, and the government will tax them even higher to pay those \nwithout jobs.\n\n I mean, the automation movement has gone on for about 100 years, and \ninstead of the doomsday scenarios coming true, economic expansion has \noccurred instead.
