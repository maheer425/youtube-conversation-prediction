HERE IS PROOF FOR MUSIC LOVERS:\n\n\n1) FROM QURAN\n\n \"And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing, etc.) \nto mislead (men) from the Path of Allah without knowledge, and takes it \n(the Path of Allah, the Verses of the Qur'an) by way of mockery.  For such \nthere will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell-Fire).\n(The Noble Qur'an - Luqman 31:6)\n\"And Istafiz [literally means: befool them gradually] those whom you can \namong them with your voice (i.e. songs, music, and other call for Allah's \ndisobedience)...\"\n(The Noble Qur'an - Al-Isra 17:64 )\n\"The Day of Resurrection draws near, None besides Allah can avert it, (or \nadvance it, or delay it).  Do you then wonder at this recital (the \nQur'an)?  And you laugh at it and weep not, Wasting your (precious) \nlifetime in pastime and amusements (singing, etc.).  So fall you down in \nprostration to Allah, and worship Him (Alone)\"\n(The Noble Qur'an - An-Najm 53:57-62)\n\n\n\n2) From the Hadith.....\n\nSahih Al-Bukhari Volume 7, Book 69, hadith #494v\nNarrated Abu 'Amir (raa) or Abu Malik Al-Ash'ari (raa) that he heard the \nProphet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, \"From among my followers \nthere will be some people who will consider illegal sexual intercourse, the \nwearing of silk, the drinking of alcoholic drinks, and the use of musical \ninstruments  [ma'aazif] as lawful.  And (from them), there will be some who \nwill stay near the side of a mountain, and in the evening their shepherd \nwill come to them with their sheep and ask them for something, but they \nwill say to him, 'Return to us tomorrow.' Allah will destroy them during \nthe night and will let the mountain fall on them, and Allah will transform \nthe rest of them into monkeys and pigs and they will remain so till the Day \nof Resurrection.\" note: Here Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) has \nmentioned music with drinking of alcohol and fornication (zina) which are a \nMAJOR (Kabair) sin!\nSunan Abu-Dawud Book 41, Hadith # 4909\nNarrated Abdullah ibn Mas'ud(raa) : Salam ibn Miskin(raa), quoting an old \nman who witnessed AbuWa'il in a wedding feast, said: They began to play, \namuse and sing. He united the support of his hand round his knees that were \ndrawn up, and said: I heard Abdullah (ibn Mas'ud) say: I heard the apostle \nof Allah (SAW) say: Singing produces hypocrisy in the heart.\nSahih Al-Bukhari and agreed upon by At-Tabari.\nSa'id ibn Jubayr(raa) reported that Ibn 'Abbas(raa) said about the verse:  \n\"And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks\" (31:6), that, \"ldle talks \nmeans singing and the like.\"\nThe Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said : \"A people of \nmy Ummah will drink wine, calling it by other than its real name. Merriment \nwill be made for them through the playing of musical instruments and the \nsinging of female singers. Allah (SWT) will cleave the earth under them and \nturn others into apes and swine.\" (Narration of Ibn Maajah ) note : This \nhadeeth has also been narrated by al-Bayhaaqi and ibn Asaakir, and has been \nauthenticated by the renowned scholar of hadeeth Ibn al-Qayyim.\nThe Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said : \"Verily Allah \nprohibited wine, gambling and al-koobah; and every intoxicant is \nprohibited.\" Sufyan said :\" I asked the narrator, Ali bin Badheemah, ' What \nis al-Koobah?' He answered, 'It is the drum'.\" (An authentic hadith \nnarrated by Imaam Ahmed bin Hanbal )\nThat the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said : \"Verily \nI did not prohibit weeping [per se], but rather I forbade two voices \n[sowtayn] which are imbecilic [ahmaq] and sinfully shameless [faajir]: one \na voice [singing] to the accompaniment of musical amusement [lahw] and \nSatan's [wind] instruments; the other, a voice [wailing] due to some \ncalamity, accompanied by striking of the face and tearing of garments. But \nthis [weeping off mine] stems from compassion, and whosoever does not show \ncompassion will not receive it.\" (The narration of Haakim and Others) note \n: This hadeeth is graded Hasan, and has been strengthened by other \nnarrations.\nAnas bin Maalik (radi Allaahu anhu) related from the Prophet (sallallaahu \nalayhi wa sallam) that \"two cursed sounds are that of the [wind] instrument \n[mizmaar] played on the occasion of joy and grace, and woeful wailing upon \nthe occurrence of adversity.\" (Narration of Abu Bakr ash-Shaafi'ee)\ufeff",
