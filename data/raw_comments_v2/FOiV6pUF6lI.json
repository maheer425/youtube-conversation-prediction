It was definitely a mutation that caused blue eyes but you \nare not a mutant because of that you have blue eyes.

Most \ndoesn't do anything however so you will most likely not even care about \nthem. A single mutation reallly only matters when it affect a trigger for \nsome other gene. Like if the first byte gave mice a yellow color on their \nfur, and changing the first bit resulted in making the gene malfuction \nand/or create a different color like black. Its something really anoying \nwhen you speak with for example creationists.

Blue eyes are recessive-which means that the chance of getting \nblue eyes without having both parents blue eyed is low. But only one of \nyour parents needed to have brown hair in order for you to have it. Blonde \nhair is recessive too-so blue eyes and blonde hair is more rare than your \ncombo. ",
