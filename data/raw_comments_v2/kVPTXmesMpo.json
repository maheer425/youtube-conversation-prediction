I realized racism isn't just a black and white problem. \nIt's brought bloodbaths to about every nation on earth at one time or \nanother.\nBrother, remember the time that white college girl came into the \nrestaurant\u2014\u200bthe one who wanted to help the [Black] Muslims and the whites \nget together\u2014\u200band I told her there wasn't a ghost of a chance andshe went \naway crying? Well, I've lived to regret that incident. In manyparts of the \nAfrican continent I saw white students helping black people. Something like \nthis kills a lot of argument. I did many things as a [Black] Muslim that \nI'm sorry for now. I was a zombie then\u2014\u200blike all [Black] Muslims\u2014\u200bI was \nhypnotized, pointed in a certain direction and told to march. Well, I guess \na man's entitled to make a fool of himself if he's ready to pay the cost. \nIt cost me 12 years.\n\nThat was a bad scene, brother. The sickness and madness of those days\u2014\u200bI'm \nglad to be free of them.\"\n\n\n\n\nYoung Socialist: How do you define Black nationalism, with which you have \nbeen identified?\n\nMalcolm X: I used to define Black nationalism as the idea that the Black \nman should control the economy of his community, the politics of his \ncommunity, and so forth.\n\nBut when I was in Africa in May, in Ghana, I was speaking with the Algerian \nambassador who is extremely militant and is a revolutionary in the true \nsense of the word (and has his credentials as such for having carried on a \nsuccessful revolution against oppression in his country). When I told him \nthat my political, social, and economic philosophy was Black nationalism, \nhe asked me very frankly: Well, where did that leave \nhim? Because he was white. He was an African, but he was Algerian, and to \nall appearances, he was a white man. And he said if I define my objective \nas the victory of Black nationalism, where does that leave him? Where does \nthat leave revolutionaries in Morocco, Egypt, Iraq, Mauritania? So he \nshowed me where I was alienating people who were true \nrevolutionaries dedicated to overturning the system of exploitation that \nexists on this earth by any means necessary.\n\nSo I had to do a lot of thinking and reappraising of my definition of Black \nnationalism. Can we sum up the solution to the problems \nconfronting our people as Black nationalism? And if you notice, I \nhaven\u2019t been using the expression for several months. But I still would be \nhard pressed to give a specific definition of the overall philosophy which \nI think is necessary for the liberation of the Black people in this country.",

From now on, top executives will no longer be judged \nby their merit, but first by their gender, and they'll be refused a job if \nthey're male. A less qualified female on the other hand must be hired:\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/26/germany-women-quotas-frauenquote-boardrooms\n\nIn the US feminists take it a step further. There have been demonstrations \naimed to pressure universities into committing the offense of vigilantism.\nWhat those feminists demand is that:\nWhen a woman accuses someone of a sex crime (false reports in 22-90% of all \ncases according to studies) the rule of law must be ignored, and the victim \nwho's accused must be expelled and barred from school forever, thus \ndestroying their life, their career and costing thousands of dollars in \ndamages.\nThat's a frontal assault on order and the rule of law.\n\n\nOr all-out hatespeech aimed at attacking and persecuting a sexual \norientation. Feminists engage in homophobic and transphobic hatred. To name \none example, prominent feminist Sheila Jeffreys in her book Beauty and \nMisogyny states that fashion is a conspiracy by gay men against all women, \nwhom they apparently hate because they fancy men.\n\nAnd let's pick some online feminist hate too, check this bunch of nutjobs \nout:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Etw8QmH23i4\n\nAll-out hate against people for having a different sexual orientation.

Let's look at the French Revolution. \nWomen played a major part. They protested and even forced the royal family \nout of Versailles. The women fought when the men couldn't. After it was all \nover, women got absolutely nothing in return. There was a law approved that \nsaid all *men* could vote, however, it did not include women even though \nthey were vital in the struggle. Just because you help fight for a cause \ndoesn't mean that you get rewards in the end. Another example can be \nAfrican Americans after WWI. Many fought in the war to prove their loyalty \nto the country and to show they are just as equal as whites. What happened? \nEven more injustice lynchings occurred and organizations like the KKK \nsought to kill them all. White men have always had automatic rights. You \ndidn't have to fight for anything. White men are the bad guys. They were \nalways the ones oppressing those who were also human. They were the ones \ntorturing women and putting other human beings into slavery.",
