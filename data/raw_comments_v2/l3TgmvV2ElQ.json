Today, most 3-D printers function similarly to standard \noffice printers. Both produce superthin layers of material, but instead of \nejecting an ink-covered sheet of paper, 3-D machines print on top of each \nlayer over and over again until an object is formed. As such, 3-D printing \nis an extraordinarily time-consuming process. But Carbon3D\u2019s technology \navoids the layering procedure, speeding up the print time significantly.\n\nCarbon3D employs a photochemical technology called Continuous Liquid \nInterface Production (CLIP), which pulls solid objects from a pool of \nliquid resin. Essentially, cross-sections of 3-D renderings are placed into \nthe resin like a reverse MRI; CLIP then uses UV light to alter the \nstructure of the resin and oxygen to halt the changes. The result is a \nquick, seamless production of a 3-D object, more akin to injection-molding \nthan printing.\n\nSpeed isn\u2019t the only benefit to CLIP. The method produces objects with \nconsistent mechanical qualities\u2014which is an issue for layer-based \nprinting\u2014and allows for a broader range of materials. With all these \nadvancements, Carbon3D\u2019s CLIP technology may be a new revolution in the \nalready-revolutionary world of 3-D printing.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n https://youtu.be/l3TgmvV2ElQ\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\ufeff",
