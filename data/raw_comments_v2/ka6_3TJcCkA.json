In fact, I would be more than happy to meet DiCaprio for coffee at \nDenny's and we could both speak about the topic as long as he wants. What I \nactually wrote was....\n\n\"It isn't that his (DiCaprio's) opinions are not important, THEY ARE\" \n(emphasis added). And later in the same post I wrote, \"What is it about \nLeonardo DiCaprio that somehow makes him MORE qualified...\" (emphasis \nadded).\n\nAnd later in a different post but on this same thread I wrote, \"what makes \nLeonardo DiCaprio MORE qualified to speak the U.N. than for example, ... \nmyself? Or You?\"\n\nAnd in another post on this same thread what I actually wrote was, \"why \nare entertainers views of the world treated as something to be MORE revered \nand honored than are my views... or yours?\" (emphasis added)\n\nIn other words, I never once remotely questioned DiCaprio's qualification \nas a \"concerned citizen.\" (that was the qualification that DiCaprio gave). \nI am a \"concerned citizen,\" so are you. My question is why does society \ngive entertainers a forum that the rest of us don't get? Why are \nentertainers views to be MORE revered than the rest of us?  \n\nYou wrote the following, \" He (DiCaprio) will clearly influence more \nminds....\" Followed by your points about how many views this video has. \nReally? Well, maybe some people are MORE influenced by an entertainer, I'm \nnot, and I don't know any reason someone else should be either. Name one \nlogical reason anyone should be MORE \"influenced\" by entertainers speaking \ntheir views versus... my neighbor for example.  \n\nWhen entertainers express themselves in a forum the rest of us don't \ntypically get, over and over, and OVER, it starts to come across as very \nprofessorial. That is especially true when they aren't really debating the \nissues, but merely making a speech (and there is a difference). Or, like \nwhen they get on some talk show and the host starts throwing them \nsoftballs. That isn't \"debating\" anything. So, when entertainers do things \nlike that it comes across like they are saying, \"hey, listen to ME, I make \nmovies.\" Or, \"hey, listen to ME, I can sing.\" They don't actually say that, \nbut that is how we feel about it. Let's face it, DiCaprio did NOT get \nto speak at the U.N. because, as he put it, he is a \"concerned citizen.\" I \nam a concerned citizen, if that is the qualification, well.. invite me \nthen. DiCaprio was invited because he is in movies. Does that make him MORE \nqualified than me? or you? or your neighbor? Oh, yes, and the other reason \nDiCaprio was invited, as you pointed out, because he can donate \"millions \nto the cause.\"\n\nOh, and I almost forgot... because he can, as you put it, \"convince the \nmindless masses on what needs to be done.\" Gee, how elitist can a person \npossibly get? I wonder if DiCaprio thinks of the \"masses\". as \n\"mindless.\" That isn't an accusation, I guess we would have to ask him. So, \njust to clarify.. me, my neighbor, the guy in my town who works at the oil \nrefinery, etc.... we are just the \"mindless masses\" whereas DiCaprio has it \nall figured out? Really??? And his qualification for having it all figured \nout over us \"mindless masses\" is that he is in movies??? Or was it that he \nis a \"concerned citizen\" (as though the rest of us are not?). \n\nIn any event, I didn't question DiCapario's qualification to speak on the \ntopic. He could speak on the topic in the same forums I get, like coffee at \nDenny's for example. Better yet, I could make a good speech on the subject \nand DiCaprio could just sit and listen and not say anything. It seems to me \nthat's what he expects the whole world to do for HIM. I didn't question \nDiCaprio's qualification to \"speak on the topic\" (your words). My question \nwas what makes him MORE qualified to speak AT THE U.N.?  ",

But, that hardly qualifies to KNOW more things \nabout the world. By that standard, Bill Gates or Warren Buffet would know \nmillions of times more than you or I.

And now I can add to the \"more credible than thou\" tactics... \nwhich people just happen to be the biggest benefactors. Geez.   \n\nOkay, fine then....\n\nWell, I am not just a financial analyst/portfolio manager. I am ALSO a ... \nhow did you put it? Oh yeah, I am ALSO  a social advocate for change \non multiple platforms as well as a benefactor of numerous organizations \nworking to combat the problems of which I speak. That's what makes ME \nqualified because that is what I do when I am not working. Now, my question \nwas... what makes Leonardo DiCaprio MORE qualified to speak the U.N. than \nfor example, ... myself? Or You?\n\nHere is another example. I was watching Letterman some years ago and one of \nhis guests was Neil Young. Young took the time to speak to no end about his \nviews of the world (or what he thinks the world should be). Fine. But in \nthe same show there was a fireman (I think it was a fireman, it has been \nsome years so I may be a bit shaky on the details of this story) it was \nsomeone who had done some heroic thing. Letterman didn't ask THAT person \nabout HIS views of the world. I remember seeing that show years ago and \nthinking, \"well why not David? You asked Neil Young!\" Granted, that person \nwas on the show NOT to express his views of the world but because he had \ndone some heroic thing. It's also true than Neil Young wouldn't have been \non the show if he couldn't play the guitar and sing. What made Neil Young \nmore qualified that Letterman asked HIM about his views of the world, but \nnot the later guest? NOTHING.\n\nLook, I am not the only one who feels this way. I have had this very \ndiscussion with many other people. I spent my whole life studying and \nliving MANY issues. Economic issues and many other things. One thing \nI about my life that I noticed about four years ago that I had never really \nthought of before. See if you can relate... I spend about half my life \nlistening to what other people THINK. That happens when I go to church, \nwhen I turn on the television, numerous other things. The other half of my \nlife is people valuing me for things I can DO. And there is a big \ndifference. Look at the emails you get from people you don't know. I get a \nbunch of them. Everyone one of them values me for something I can do. Buy \nsomething, usually. THEY don't ask me what I think about anything. You \nunderstand WHY I and many others resent \"Hollywood\" being given conduits \nfor what they think that the rest of us don't have? \n\nBy the way, just for the record, I would have spoken at the U.N., if \nanything, significantly better than DiCaprio did. I wouldn't have needed a \nteleprompter. At most I would have had just an index card in my palm with a \nfew bullet point notes on it of points I wanted to cover. That is the way I \ngave every other speech I ever made.    \n\nOne of the things people like about this high tech, youtube, information \nage is... you ARE media. Or, at least part of it. Like this post for \nexample. At least it's something. But they still didn't invite me to speak \nat the U.N. did they? Nor you.\n\nSo, \"Valkyrie editing\".... what do you think?\n\n          ",
