In the original series he \nwas Gomez's uncle which means he's actually brother or brother in law to \nGrandama addams or *mama.* Thing is also odd in this movie as well \nconsidering in the original 1964 series thing wasnt just a hand, he was a \nfull arm that extended out of different parts of the house. He was more of \nan interdenominational being rather than just a hand. The largest thing \nwrong with the movie was their depiction of Wednesday. Their daughter isnt \nso morose and cruel and miserable in the original series. This Wednesday in \nthis movie just seems sadistic but not in an addams sense of sadism, she \njust seems cruel and mean which is something the addams family hates. And \nthey make wednesday look older than pugsley which is wrong because pugsley \nis the older brother to wednesday. In short, this movie was a \ndisappointment after the beauty of the original series. One last thing i \nhave to mention Carrolyn Jones>Angelica houston Carrolyn is so much sexier \nthan the current morticia\ufeff",

I think conceptually they're basically the same \nthing so I think the difference in the show and movies is fine, for all we \nknow it was intended Thing be a disembodied hand and the technology was \nsimply out of grasp.\n\nWednesday was much more morbid and morose in the original comic than in the \nTV show (watch the cartoon, she's similar to the film version). I \npersonally don't think she's overly sadistic in the movies, remember that \nbasically her entire family is immune to damage, and most of her \nshenanigans are played for laughs rather than as acts of cruelty. I think \nthe intention of the writers plays a big part of The Addams Family. \nRemember that at heart, they exist for comedic purposes, to compare and \ncontrast with regular society. They could very easily be a lot darker, but \nrather they're done in a way that's designed to make us laugh.",
