Buffy the Vampire Slayer having two gay \ncharacters(not stereotypes but you get my point) and many more than any of \nus can count. Again Live Action getting exempt from that kind of censorship \nwhile cartoons and anime get screwed over. Kids and Teenagers even if  it's \nthrew Gay Stereotypes need to learn that Gay people exsist and not just \nwhen their adults or nowadays find news stories about Gay People on the net \nrandomly. I'm not gay but it does get me annoyed when Cartoons in any \nformat depicts gay people it almost completely gets censored even if its \nfrom a stereotype character yet live action stuff especially Family Shows \nalmost always gets away with it, its a weird double standered like with a \nlot of censorship as is does\ufeff",
