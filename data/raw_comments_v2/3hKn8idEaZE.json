He criticized \nthe swing axle design, which in it's stock form on the Corvair was prone to \n\"tuck under\" as he called it. He was right, when a swing axle set up is \ndone incorrectly, the wheels pinch inward. My Baja Bug was raised up and \nyou could see a ridiculous amount of camber, from the back.\n \nNader further explained, the Corvair relied on very specific tire \npressures, which exceeded the tire manufacturer's recommended pressure \nrange, to compensate for the lack of the neccessary anti-roll bar, which \nChevy rejected. But, the tire pressure requirement, band aid fix for the \ntuck under issue, was not made clear to dealers and Corvair owners. He also \nmentioned that Chevy had an unadvertised suspension package and there were \nsome aftermarket packages, that adequately solved most of the tuck under \nand suspension issues. In 1965, after Nader's book came out, Chevy \nredesigned the suspension, with a fully independent, four link set up.\n\nMost of the rest of the book focuses several other important, automotive \nsafety issues. The book will forever be remembered as a book about the \nCorvair, but it brought up many critical safety issues which had nothing to \ndo with the Corvair, such as: \"The Second Collision\" which occurs when \nunrestrained bodies are allowed to fly around inside of cars that are \nfilled with chrome trimmed interiors and all metal dashboards. He talked \nabout non collapsable steering columns, unforgiving, sharp instrument \npanels, non-safety glass in windshields, seat belts, door strength, roll \nbars, suicide doors. He talked about how the ornamental bumpers of the time \nwould drag a pedestrian under the car, rather than bounce them off. He \ncovered the industry focus on stylish design, at the expense of safety. The \nlist of subjects goes on.The guy was kind of a hero in my book.

It's \njust one form of independent suspension, and it's basically garbage, IMO.\nIn 1964, the (still swing axle) Corvair received an auxiliary spring (not a \ncamber compensator) added to the rear, that while it supported the weight \nof the car, it did not have any effect on body roll as it was allowed to \npivot at the center of the car. Chevrolet added an anti-roll bar to the \nfront to compensate for the increased body roll caused by the new rear leaf \nspring.\nThis caused the rear tires to naturally assume a more negative camber \nattitude in the corners, and the front to understeer more. So you could say \nthe '64s were half fixed.\n The 1965 -69 Corvairs had what could be called a multilink rear \nsuspension--similar to a 63+ Corvette and Jag XK-E.",
