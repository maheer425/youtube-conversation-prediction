What we see in reality, is politicians fighting hard against \nany attempt to limit their gerrymandering powers; e.g. recent lawsuit filed \nby Republicans.

The same goes with political parties. Political Parties \nby definition is a good thing, it is a group of people with similar ideas \ncoming together and sharing/supporting eachothers ideas. The political \nparties we know of (In almost every country) are corrupted and focus on \nmaking people of the party conform to the party's ideas, instead of \nsupporting the growth of new and better ideas or systems.\nFor Americans if you want a real life and current (in respect to my current \ntime typing this) example watch this \nhttp://thedailyshow.cc.com/full-episodes/xpjjio/october-30--2014---spoon \nSTART AT minute 10 \n\nPS C.G.P Grey your videos are awesome keep up the good work.

            "text": "+STDrepository Your comparison of what I'll call the Euro-centric \nparliamentary system and the Jeffersonian democracy system overlooks some \nvery important real-world factors:\n1. New party formation and expansion is much easier under the parliamentary \nsystem as practiced in most such countries. Both systems inhibit new \nparties to an extent, but it's far worse in the U.S. system, which \nhandicaps them by limiting ballot, funding and debate participation, and \nwhere the \"free\" news media ignores them more than media do in \nparliamentary systems.\n2. In the parliamentary system, the candidate-picking bosses always have to \nbe wary of losing their share of the vote to spin-off parties that are \nfocused on narrower minorities - such as, in your example, anti-abortion \nsocialists - so they need to field slates that at least acknowledge the \nextremes within their ranks. Such \"niche\" voter groups tend to be crowded \nout in a two-party dominated system, but can more easily, if they field \ntalented candidates, win seats in parliaments. \n3. Proportional voting by party improves representation by subdividing the \nlawmaking body into interest groups that represent smaller shares of the \nelectorate. Very many Americans feel that their views are not represented \nby either the Republican or Democratic platforms, but they have very few \noptions to challenge them. A third-party movement still faces challenges \nvs. established parties in a parliamentary system, but their odds of \nwinning a seat or two are far greater there.",

            "text": "+Daan Dekker  Well better is an opinion so if you like your system than \nthat is great.  But as far as how democratic the systems are, there is no \ncomparison. The US system gives people far more control in electing \nrepresentatives to government and provides far more accountability for \nthose representatives.\n\nI can explain more in detail..\nFirst off there is the lack of a primary in the European parliament system. \n This means that instead of the people choosing the candidates, the \ncandidates are chosen by a few party bosses.  If you for example want to \nvote for the Socialist party, but the Socialist party boss has chosen \ncandidates who all  support abortion but you are a Socialist who supports \nthe right of a baby to life.  \nYou really have no option at all..  \n\nHowever in the primary system, you could first vote to choose a socialist \nparty candidate who is pro-life, and then if he wins the nomination for \nyour area, you can then vote for him in the general election.   Even if \nthere are no  pro-life socialist party candidates, you yourself can run in \nthe primary as a pro-life socialist. Even if the party boss doesn't want \nyou to. \n\nThere is also the geographic representation system, which ties a seat to a \nspecific area usually consisting of just a handful of towns or part of a \nlarge city. \n\nLets look at an example,  say the Dutch government chose your tiny town as \nthe site for a nuclear waste disposal pit.  Obviously you would not be \nhappy about this, but what can you do?  The rest of Holland doesn't care, \nand your town has a small population and could never influence the \nparliament. You would have to try to start some kind of national awareness \ncampaign and hope people listen.\n\nBut in the geographic representation system, you have your own \nrepresentative who is in the parliament who's only job is to serve your \narea. He could filibuster other legislation and cause trouble until the \nrest of the legislators agree to move the nuclear waste. Or he could refuse \nto vote for legislation unless it includes an amendment to move the waste \nsite.  Either way, the end result is the minorities are protected from \nbeing abused by the majority. This protection does not occur in a popular \nvote only system.",

This eliminates all problems you can have with elections \nbecause it is just a fair way of electing.
