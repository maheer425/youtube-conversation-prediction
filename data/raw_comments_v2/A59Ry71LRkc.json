If you are talking about \nAmerican Democracy in terms of the idea or the system then no, the concept \nof democracy has been talked about for a very long time and the idea has \nbeen experimented with the creations of parliaments in both the U.K., \nIreland, and the Iroquoi Confederacy. However if we are talking in terms of \nstates, or countries, then yes. To explain you have to understand that the \ndefinition of state and the concept of the state were first developed at \nthe Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, this immediately disqualifies Greece and \nRome which, on top of not really being democratic to begin with, were not \nstates. This also disqualifies the Iroquoi Confederacy which was a \ncollection of tribes working together, very democratic system, not a state. \nSo what about the U.K. it had a parliament prior to the American Revolution \ndidn't it? It did have a parliament before the establishment of the U.S. \nbut to call it a democracy would be a mistake. Forget the fact that those \nin the House of Commons were related to those in the House of Lords,who \nthemselves were selected by the monarch, we have to look at where the real \npower sat, and until the Victorian and Edward eras in the late 19th and \nearly 20th centuries, the power mostly stayed with the crown and the lords. \nSo to finish off the U.S. is not the oldest concept of democracy nor the \noldest experiment, but it is the first state to meet the requirements of \nmodern democracy and therefore the first and oldest democratic state.  \ufeff",
