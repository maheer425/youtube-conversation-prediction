IF possible, avoid western attire (clothing).\nShun publicity.\nCareful with dispensing large sums of cash, if possible avoid doing so and \nkeep large financial transaction short.\nHeed surroundings: people suddenly leaving area for gang/criminal ambush, \nareas people avoid, watch for rise in local people disappearance (may \nindicate start of dangerous activity - kidnappings, hostage ransom, etc.). \nAvoid public disputes, confrontations or anti-sentiments of your country \nrallies.\n\nFlight Safety:\nAvoid lay overs or flight stop offs in high threat areas listed by State \nDepartment.\nHotel/hostile security: know escape routes, recognize normal activity in \nyour area versus unusual activity and learn of other security measures \navailable to you.\n\nOn Foot:\nMaintain cautious attitude.\nWalk facing traffic (avoid exposing back to oncoming vehicle traffic).\nHave a plan of action if you're going to have a crisis.\n\nTraveling by Car:\nMake yourself a hard target (unappealling target for attack and ambush). \nUse clearly marked and well-maintained (damage vehicles present lower \nchance of survival in emergency situations) taxi cabs.\n\nExplosives (Bomb threats):\nMaintain vigil checks of signs of tampering: hotel room, rental car in \nparking, etc. If you sense potential bomb threat, carefully and safely \nescape area and report to police.\n\nHostage Situation:\nIf capture, avoid resisting unduly (reactions that are not effective).\n\nGuest Activities:\nUnderstand you are a guest in someone's else country (they are the host \nnation). Do not use illegal drugs in visiting country, if caught, you may \ncomplicate matters for your imprisonment and extradition (criminal custody \ntransfer to your country depending on foreign political relationship of the \ncountries and international law.)
