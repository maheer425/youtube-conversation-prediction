Evidence does, which you cannot provide for disproving religion, but \nthat is a fallacy, and argument to ignorance (which is any argument that \nuses a lack of evidence as evidence). Please consider mr staunch atheist \nthat your beliefs require just as much faith as someone who is religious. \nCase in point, you deny a there being a deity or any higher power, this is \nnot a provable fact but a choice in how you view the world. This goes for \nReligious views as well, its just the way you view things, saying Science \ndisproves religion is a not a valid argument because you can't prove that, \njust as the opposite cannot be done. Now to give a bit more defensible \ncredit to mr ammo, think about religious texts in this sense, they rely on \nboth metaphor, and allegory heavily.
