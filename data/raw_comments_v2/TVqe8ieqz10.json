(Even how the \nanswers are all musical notes plucked with animations vs. spoken.  It \ncaptures the spirit of patience with someone with old ideas being shown new \nones, like \"wait?  why!  don't throw it in a river\")\n\nBUT: My praise is only as long as it's open source and not going to brick \nyou for \"watching the wrong video\" or \"having the wrong letter sequence in \nyour name\", or something 1984-like.  So please reassure me that Google is \ntoo big and color-coded to fail.

It just hasn't reached the level where I \ncan dump the desktop yet. I long for that day to come soon.\n\nReally, all I need is a 2.5gHz i5 with 8GB of RAM and an SSD in an ultra \nform factor for $300, and I will be very happy. Is that so much to ask? :)",

Its and addition, similar to the first intentional use of \na tablet (internet browsing) but in the laptop form factor as typing on a \ntablet can be cumbersome. I replaced my ipad with one of these. Also the \namount of people who are crying over it not being able to play games and be \nuseless without wifi, isn't your multiplayer mod useless offline on your \ngame too?

You don't \nreally know what you're talking about. At the beginning of 2013, I started \ndocumenting my complaints about this chromebook. It's 80 pages long now. \nSome of it is longer rants but most of it is entries of a few lines on \nproblems and repeated problems with the interface, wireless, Google Drive, \nboots, logins, tabs automatically refreshing, being told Chrome OS would \nstart automatically deleting files because Offline, which I couldn't \ndisable (even though I had \"disabled\" it via Google Drive, it had no \neffect), was taking up the lion's share of the 16GB SSD, and many other \nthings.\n\nYou don't know. Coming onto this thread and suggesting to me very obvious \nstuff that makes me out to be a bit simple-minded actually makes you look \nsimple-minded to me. People like you are why the chromebook is successful. \nYou make good slaves. You work crappy jobs or maybe not-so-crappy jobs that \nused to pay well but really give you enough that you can afford to blow \nmost of it on over-priced stuff the cost of which has become dirt-cheap to \nproducers because they've ensured as the super-rich that everyone else is \nworking for nothing while they make all the money, whether average citizens \nare working for minimum wage, or are lawyers, doctors, or even business \npeople running relatively large businesses that are nothing compared to the \ntruly big and successful businesses.\n\nBut that's still no excuse for not checking it out for yourself before \ncoming onto my post and suggesting I'm the one responsible for my bad \nexperience. It is my fault for trusting Google to keep or try to keep its \npromises, but my goal, when I get around to it, will be to help others not \nto make the same mistake in thinking Google has their best interests at \nheart or will honour the ethos of \"Don't Be Evil\" when they'd happily screw \nyou over if they knew, based on their organized information, that they \ncould easily get away with it because people like *you* will let them.\n\nHere's another ad from Google: http://youtu.be/0QRO3gKj3qw\n\nIf you're not willing to exercise more than the kind of entry-level \nmentality that a modern 14-year-old could easily exceed when it comes to \ntechnology and choosing appropriate devices, I don't think you have any \nright to expect me to treat you any better, and I prefer not to associate \nwith minors.",

Google made promises that it broke when it didn't have to. It would \nhave cost them more money in writing better code to keep those promises, \nbut they basically screwed over early adopters that counted on their \npromises of \"Fast Web\" or \"Fast. Web...\" and anything else they said. I \nthink Google knew that people like you would gloss over what's happened \ninstead of paying attention and even make excuses for Google because the \nvery Windows computers and Windows operating system Google criticized in \npromoting the chromebook is still your standard and you simply see \nchromebooks and Chrome OS as browser-only computers. Google is in full \ncontrol of the operating system and has maybe two dozen models of \nchromebooks and chromeboxes to keep up with... unlike Android, which Google \nis also responsible for, and which runs many apps that run directly on the \noperating system, as opposed to within the browser. Compared to Android, \nChrome OS is extremely simplistic, running mostly conventional hardware, \nbut with specialized firmware, boot, desktop environment (which was their \nchoice), a web browser, and a file manager.\n\nMy expectations were based directly on what Google promised instead of the \nexperiences with more-conventional computers that Google said chrome \nnotebooks would be different from.",
