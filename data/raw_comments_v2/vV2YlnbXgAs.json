Tears allow us to see CLEARER.\nI would like to share with everyone of you that \"Lose is Win, and Win is \nLose\".\nAllow me to explain what I mean by that: What the world sees/ values is \ncompletely opposite and DIFFERENT from what God sees and values.\nThe world prioritizes Money, Fame, Status, Pride (looking down on those who \nare not esteem highly by the world), Envy, Jealousy, Covetousness.\nBut God, and His true believers prioritizes the exact opposite - Loving \nyour enemies, Love your neighbor (Family and Friends) as how you love \nYourself, Help those in need (going through emotional, physical, financial \ndifficulties)...\nWHAT THE WORLD SEE AS \"COOL\", JESUS SEES AS \"UNCOOL\" and vice versa.\nThe evil one is Powerful. But always remember, JESUS HAS OVERCOME the world.\nLove, Faith, Patience, Hope. And Love, is the most powerful of all these 4. \nKeep loving, no matter how difficult it is. Because Love overcome ALL \nthings (hatred, envy, uncontentment).\nWin is lose, and lose is win. Always rmb, when u lose (accordingly to \nworldly standards/ the world's eyes) you're actually winning in God's eyes. \nand whatever you do in God's eyes will NOT be in vain. Press ON to the \nfinish line, the throne. He will be waiting for us there into eternity, to \nlive without pain forever and ever.\n***Watch this illustration on God's Love: God's Love (A Collection of \nInspirational Videos)\ufeff",
