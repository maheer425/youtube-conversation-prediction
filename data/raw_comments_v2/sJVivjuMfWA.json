He didn't use a fixed sample size, but stopped \nwhen he had 6 correct digits.\nThere is a much more beautiful proof that doesn't use calculus. It's based \non the number of crossings (which is 0 or 1 if the needle is shorter than \nthe line spacing).\nUsing the fact that the mean of a sum is the sum of the means, the average \nnumber of crossings doesn't depend on the shape of the needle--it could \neven be a shoelace. And the average number is proportional to the length of \nthe needle. To see this imagine the needle chopped into a large number of \ntiny pieces. The whole is the sum of the parts. Next suppose the needle is \nbent into a circle which just fits between the lines. If d is the line \nspacing the length of the needle is d x pi. There will (almost) always be \ntwo crossings, so the average number is 2. Therefore the average number per \nunit length is 2/(d pi) giving (2 l)/(d pi) for a needle of length l.\ufeff",
