            "text": "\nThis essay will argue that well-designed cyanide gas chambers were indeed \npresent at Auschwitz, and did work efficiently, but that they were operated \nfor purposes of hygiene and disinfection, in order to save lives and not \ntake them. Terrible mass mortality came about in the German labour-camps, \nespecially towards the end of the war, but maybe we have to try a bit \nharder to understand what caused this. Amongst all the archival material \nfor the German Third Reich, there has always been a notable lack of \ndocumentation to support the existence of an intentional mass-extermination \nprogram \u2013 of Jews, or anyone else. We have all heard stories about a Nazi \nprogram of exterminating Jews, but to what extent are there documents or \nany physical remains showing this? Has the traditional Holocaust story \ndeveloped merely out of rumours, misunderstandings, and wartime propaganda? \nFrom stories pre-dating the Second World War to the Nuremberg Trials which \ngave official sanction to the notion, to subsequent trials, books and \nfilms, we have had it imprinted on our collective psyche.\n\nEurope needs, more than anything else, a truth and reconciliation forum to \nget to the bottom of these matters, and try to exorcise the demonic \nhate-images. Many European states have passed laws that prohibit citizens \nfrom expressing doubt \u2013 Germany, France, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Czech \nRepublic, Romania, Belgium and Switzerland. Collectively, we need to work \ntrough our despair, rage, and ideas of blame, to try and access the real \nhistorical record.\n\nCyanide at Auschwitz\n\nZyklon-B was used at Auschwitz, as an insecticide. It was vital in \nattempting to maintain hygiene that mattresses be deloused. Liquid hydrogen \ncyanide was adsorbed onto clay-type granules, designed to make the deadly \ngas as \"safe\" as it could be. If you go to Auschwitz today, you can't see \nany authentic gas chambers. You see stone huts, and experts have testified \nthat they could not have been used to gas people, owing to problems in \nsealing them up (Zyklon-B released its cyanide gas rather slowly[1]).\n\nIn 1988 the scientific team of Fred Leuchter (a US execution-expert \"Mr \nDeath\" in gas-chamber technology) visited Poland, and concluded that the \nAuschwitz \"gas chambers\" could not possibly have functioned in the alleged \nmanner \u2013 i.e., they were not gas chambers[2]. In the following years, \nothers would confirm the accuracy of his seminal, \"Leuchter Report\" . The \nGerman chemist Germar Rudolf, who worked at the Max Plank institute for \nSolid State Physics, is now in jail, because he likewise measured the high \nlevels of the cyanide in the walls of the de-lousing chambers. It happens \nthat this gas bonds permanently with iron, and iron is present in all the \ncement etc of stone walls. Whereas, he found none in the walls of what were \nsupposed to be the \"gas chambers\" which were mainly shower units. He \nthereby confirmed the work of Leuchter who likewise only found remains of \nthe cyanide gas-insecticide in the de-lousing chambers.[3]\n\nAfter Rudolf's report was published in 1993, he lost his job and was \nprevented from completing his doctorate, then a few years later he was \ngiven a jail sentence. He is now in a high-security prison near Stuttgart, \nfor the crime of not finding cyanide in the \"gas chambers[4],\" echoing \nLeuchter's cyanide residue investigations. [5] When a chemist is put in \njail, for replicating the result of another \u2013 in Germany of all places, the \nnation which invented chemical procedure \u2013 then the farce cannot continue \nfor much longer[6] (The gas chambers were conveniently located east of \nGermany behind the Iron Curtain to make them inaccessible to westerners, \nwhich helped the myth to flourish).\n\nThe Leuchter results were almost too good to be true, with a three orders \nof magnitude difference between the cyanide levels in the delousing chamber \nwalls (about one part per thousand) and those in the washing chambers (aka \n\"gas chambers\" ), around one part per million. They are not published in \nany peer-reviewed chemistry journal, for obvious reasons. The only way to \nhold a debate on this subject appears to be in a courtroom, while being \nprosecuted! It is hard to reach the calm condition necessary for \nreplication of chemical measurements. Nonetheless people have replicated \nthe fundamental result[7], and even folk with no interest in chemistry can \nappreciate the pretty blue colour on the outside of the de-lousing chamber \n(where the ferrocyanide has seeped right through the wall) and its complete \nabsence around the so-called \"gas chambers.\" Let's face it, the case is \nestablished: the cyanide poison was used where the German records state \nthat it was used for delousing mattresses, clothing etc., whereas it was \nnot used where the US and UK (at Nuremberg) alleged.\n\nTourists, thirty million of them, have filed through \"Krema 1\" at \nAuschwitz, with its piteous piles of shoes, etc of the dead. This was \nreconstructed after the war in 1946[8], a fact revealed 1992 by Dr. \nFranciszek Piper, the Senior Curator and Director of Archives of the \nAuschwitz State Museum. The historic remains from the camp are such things \nas shower-unit huts, a swimming pool and a morgue. There was a camp \norchestra, and quite a collection of pictures from the camp \nart-classes,[9]although these cannot be shown in Germany or Poland, on \naccount of laws prohibiting the doubting of the Holocaust. Anne Frank of \n\"Diary\" fame came to the camp in 1944 with her father who was ill. He was \nput into the hospital there, and recovered, suggesting that he was decently \nlooked after.[10]\n\nThe \"gas chambers\" at Auschwitz had water pipes in their ceilings, \nindicating that they were designed as shower units. They generally lacked \ntight-seal doors, which would have been essential, even though these were \neasy to install \u2013 the Leuchter report cited the absence of such seals as \none reason why the alleged \"gas chambers\" would never have functioned.\n\n\"The Final Solution\" An Export Program\n\nThe \"Final Solution\" of Adolf Hitler retained a single meaning right \nthrough WW2, central to the program of \"National socialism,\" and signified \nthe deportation of Jews, generally eastwards to Poland and Russia[11]. This \nprogram did not change at any point, e.g. the Wannsee conference of \n1942,[12]to signify deliberate extermination. If that practice ever \nhappened, it was not a centrally-directed policy and did not involve gas \nchambers: many tons of documentation of \"Third Reich\" policies remains, and \nno-one has been able to find therein any hint of such a meaning of \nintentional genocide. The historical record fails to show any central \ndecision to exterminate Jews by Nazi Germany.\n\nThe Gestapo and Zionists were collaborating in the late 30s because they \nhad in this respect similar aims.[13]But, a German Foreign Office circular \nbulletin of June 22, 1937 stated that: \"In view of the anti-German \nagitation of international Jewry, Germany cannot agree that the formation \nof a Palestine Jewish state would help the peaceful development of the \nnations of the world\" .[14]International Jewish organisations twice \ndeclared war on Germany, in 1933 then again in 1939[15]. As the \"final \nsolution\" policy[16]was thwarted by the Allies, the camps became places of \nhard labour; then under the impact of Allied terror-bombing ravages of \ndisease and famine took place.\n\nNo Documents?\n\nAt the Auschwitz trial held at Frankfurt in the mid-sixties, the court had \nto conclude that it lacked \"almost all the means or evidence available in a \nnormal murder trial\" including \"the bodies of the victim, autopsy reports, \nexpert reports on the cause of death, evidence as to the criminals, murder \nweapons, etc.\"[17] Far from leading to doubt, this gave to the mythic gas \nchambers a metaphysical status, doubt of which was forbidden. ' No \ndocuments have survived, perhaps none ever existed,' concluded the \nHolocaust historian L\u00e9on Poliakov.[18]\n\n\"In the case of the rush to impute to the Nazis a programme for the \nextermination of millions of people which has implausibly left no material \ntraces, all the normal rules of historiography seem not only to have been \nsuspended, but to have been violated over and over again. Historians \nroutinely cite documents from secondary works like Raul Hilberg's The \nDestruction of the European Jews (1961) or from printed collections of \ndocuments, such as Robert Wolfe's Holocaust: The Documentary Evidence \u2013 but \nthey never cite original documents.[19]\n\nThe nearest we have to primary-source documents concerning what went on \nwithin the camps, comes from the bulky, three-volume International Red \nCross Report published in 1948. This and especially Volume III describes \nthe couple of thousand regular, routine inspection-visits that its doctors \nmade through the war years to the Polish labour-camps. Their report never \nhints at any gas-chamber, nor any mass-cremations. While maintaining a \npolitically neutral position[20], it confirms that mortality in the camps \nwas to a large extent caused by the allied terror-bombing.[21]Likewise \nWinston Churchill's bulky, six-volume account of the War gives no allusion \nto the subject, especially volume Six, Triumph and Tragedy where one would \nexpect to have some allusion if he believed it had happened.[22]\n\nThe head of the SS camp administration office sent a directive dated Dec. \n28, 1942, to Auschwitz and the other concentration camps. It sharply \ncriticised the high death rate of inmates due to disease, and ordered that \n\"camp physicians must use all means at their disposal to significantly \nreduce the death rate in the various camps.\" Furthermore, it ordered: \"The \ncamp doctors must supervise more often than in the past the nutrition of \nthe prisoners and, in cooperation with the administration, submit \nimprovement recommendations to the camp commandants ... The camp doctors \nare to see to it that the working conditions at the various labor places \nare improved as much as possible.\" The directive stressed that \"the \nReichsfuhrer SS [Heinrich Himmler] has ordered that the death rate \nabsolutely must be reduced.\"[23]A further letter to all concentration camp \ncommanders dated 20th January, 1943, reaffirmed that \"every means must be \nused to lower the death rate.\" By September 1943 Auschwitz still had \nmortality peaking at 80/day, viewed as \"catastrophic\" by the SS \nadministration. Thus, from authentic documents concerning the need to \nreduce fatalities at the Auschwitz camp, the world has moved to a belief in \ngenocide, with not a single authentic, supporting document[24]. The \nAuschwitz camp was set up as an industrial plant using the giant coalfields \nof Poland, and located at the confluence of rivers; it was essential to the \nwar-effort \u2013 it would have made no sense to start exterminating its inmates.\n\nThe Hamburg judge Wilhelm Staeglich had been positioned near Auschwitz \nduring the war and had on various occasions dropped into the camps around \nthere. The conditions seemed fairly tolerable, he recalled, and certainly \nnothing resembling an extermination program existed. In particular, he had \ndiscerned no fear of mistreatment amongst the inmates. He published a \ntestimony to this effect in 1973, and in return for his shocking news a \nGerman inquisition forced him to resign his job, stripped him of his \ndoctoral degree, and banned his book. He was then subjected to police \nraids. His book, translated into English, is an essential text.[25]\n\nGerman military radio messages were successfully decrypted at Bletchley \nPark using the \"enigma\" codebreaker. Concerning the labour camps, over the \nperiod Spring 1942-February 1943, the following information was \nobtained:[26]\n\n\"The return from Auschwitz, the largest of the camps with 20,000 prisoners, \nmentioned illness as the main cause of death, but included references to \nshootings and hangings. There were no references in the decrypts to \ngassings.\"\n\nThat seems clear enough \u2013 though no-one took any notice of it at Nuremberg.\n\nBodies were disposed of by individual cremation, and the records for coke \nfuel consumption over the period February 1942 \u2013 October 1943 for the \ncremation ovens indicate that around five thousand bodies were then burnt. \nThat accords with the number of registered, deceased inmates, viz those who \nhad died from natural causes[27], who had to be cremated rather than buried \nbecause of the great typhoid epidemics. This suggests that no \nmass-incineration of bodies took place. Josef Kramer, a supervisor at the \nAuschwitz camp, gave a statement after the war which is recommended by \nProfessor Butz as probably genuine: it had 350-500 deaths per week \nhappening over May-November 1944, all from natural causes, a very high \nfigure because sick prisoners were sent there, and the dead were all \ncremated. He believed the camp held up to 100,000 prisoners, mainly Poles \nand Russians.[28]\n\nNo Photos?\n\nNot only is there no trace of \"Third Reich\" documentation[29] for what is \nalleged, but no photographs exist showing anything resembling such a \ngroup-gassing procedure. Do you believe that Jews both male and female \nstripped then marched into the gas chambers, then were hauled out in piles? \nIf so, are you willing to believe that neither the very-thorough Germans \nnor the clever Jews wanted or were able to get a single picture of this \nultimate horror? Go to Google and search \u2013 you'll find rows of emaciated \nbodies, dead of typhus, will that do? I don't think so.\n\nUS air-photographs taken in 1944 (released in 1978) when the \"program\" was \nsupposed to be in full swing do not show any huge crematoria burning \ncorpses nor queues entering the \"gas chambers\":\n\n\"The few air photos of Auschwitz-Birkenau known to date from the period of \nDecember 1943 to February 1945 show no signs of fuel depots, smoke from \nchimneys or open fires, burning pits or pyres. The photos were altered: \nZyklon B input hatches, groups of inmates, and walls around crematoria were \nretouched onto the photo negatives. [\u2026] To this day there is no air photo \nevidence to support the alleged mass murder of the Jews at any location in \nEurope occupied by the Germans during World War Two [\u2026] That the photos in \nwestern hands were altered in order to incriminate Germany, and were first \npublished by the CIA, is also very significant indeed.\" [30] \n\nThe Fabrication of Untruth\n\nLet's hear a couple of testimonies concerning the dreaded gas-chambers. An \nAustrian woman, Maria Van Herwaarden, testified about her camp experiences \nin a Toronto District Court in March 1988, as she had been interned in \nAuschwitz-Birkenau in 1942 for having sexual relations with a Polish forced \nlaborer. On the train trip to the camp, a Gypsy woman told her and the \nothers that they would all be gassed at Auschwitz. Upon arrival, Maria and \nthe other women were ordered to undress and go into a large concrete room \nwithout windows to take a shower. The terrified women were sure that they \nwere about to die. But then, instead of gas, water came out of the shower \nheads. Auschwitz was no vacation center, Maria confirmed, and she witnessed \nthe death of many fellow inmates by disease, particularly typhus, and quite \na few committed suicide. But she saw no evidence at all of mass killings, \ngassings, or of any extermination program.[31]A Jewish woman named Marika \nFrank arrived at Auschwitz-Birkenau from Hungary in July 1944, when 25,000 \nJews were supposedly gassed and cremated daily. She likewise testified \nafter the war that she heard and saw nothing of \"gas chambers\" during the \ntime she was interned there. She heard the gassing stories only later.[32] \n\nThe Allied carpet-bombing destroyed the supply lines for the Camps, and so \nthe death-toll mounted from famine and disease. Leaflets were dropped from \nthe air, alleging that at Auschwitz a \"final solution\" /extermination of \nJews policy was being conducted, using gas. [33] That was the genesis of \nthe story, as those Allied-propaganda leaflets were believed. Greeted by \nthe sight of rows of famished Jews who had died of e.g. typhoid, it was not \nhard to see its confirmation. \"Far from it being common knowledge in \nGermany that people were being gassed [\u2026] the vast majority of Germans were \nhorrified by the United Nations accusations and they protested that they \nhad never heard of such acts until after the cessation of hostilities when \nthey had begun listening to United Nations broadcasts.\" Since the British \nBroadcasting Corporation had been broadcasting these accusations regularly \nfor many months before the end of the war, those Germans who had \"common \nknowledge\" of the gassing before the war's end most likely got this \n\"knowledge\" from the BBC![34] The gas-chamber legend was born in December \n1941, when the German author Thomas Mann declared on the BBC that in German \nhospitals the severely wounded, the old and the feeble were culled with \npoison gas. This was the \"first appearance of gas chambers in propaganda.\" \n[35]\n\nAs to how the stories got going, here is a remark by Faurisson: \"The \nForeign Office saw the new rumors of the Second World War only as Jewish \ninventions, and many in American circles shared that conviction[36]. Edward \nBene\u0161, President of Czechoslovakia (in exile in London), announced in \nNovember 1942, after inquiry by his staff, that the Germans, contrary to \nwhat had been reported to him, were not exterminating the Jews. The \nAmerican Jew, Felix Frankfurter, a Supreme Court judge, stated to Jan \nKarski on the subject: \"I can' t believe you.\" In August of 1943, Cordell \nHull, Secretary of State, warned the U.S. ambassador in Moscow by telegram \nthat in planning a joint Allied statement on \"the German crimes in Poland\", \nit would be advisable to eliminate any mention of the gas chambers, since, \nas the British pointed out, there was \"insufficient evidence\" in the \nmatter[37]\n\nThe Hoax of Nuremberg\n\nA modern inquiry needs to start from the data-fabrication at Nuremberg by \nthe US/UK, using systematic assassination and torture of witnesses. The \nNuremberg trials started in 1946 with the image of six million dead as \nfirmly established.[38]This did not emerge as a conclusion from the trials, \nbut in its immensity it was presented to the tortured and/or \nbeaten[39]Nazis as a fact, and would they confess their part in it? All the \nmain defendants at Nuremberg insisted that prior to the trial they had not \nknown of any mass murder of Jews: except that Rudolf H\u00f6ss, the former \nCommandant of Auschwitz, signed on March 15, 1946, a document averring that \nhe had overseen the slaughter of two and a half million Jews, and this was \nread out on 15th April at Nurnberg. That day signified the birth of \nAuschwitz's horror-myth. Two weeks earlier, H oe ss had remarked:\n\n\"Certainly, I signed a statement that I killed two and half million Jews. I \ncould just as well have said it was five million Jews. There are certain \nmethods by which any confession can be obtained, whether it is true or \nnot.\"[40]\n\nDecades later, an account was published of how Hoess had been tortured for \nthree days and nights without sleep by a British army team in order to \nextract that statement.[41]In a letter to his wife, Hoess apologised for \nhis \"confessions\" and explains that they had been extracted from him under \ntorture[42]. The victorious Allies could not have their \"truth\" come out at \nNuremberg, without the assistance of torture. In 2001, Patricia Meehan \ndiscussed the network of secret \"Direct Interrogation Centres\" the British \nhad set up in their occupational zone of Germany[43]- torture chambers, to \nprepare \"evidence\" for the upcoming trials. A Zionist influence was noted \nat the Nuremberg trials,[44]not least concerning the figure of six \nmillion.[45]\n\nWeighty books are in print as memorials to \"the Holocaust,\" but, let's hear \na sceptical view from Down Under:[46]\n\n\n\"Yet in the case of the Holocaust, the dearth of material evidence for the \nexistence of large-scale extermination programme is not perceived as \nsignificant. It is assumed that the Nazis destroyed their vast death \nmachinery so thoroughly as to preclude all possibility of postwar \ndetection. It is not permissible to express doubts as to whether the Nazis \ncould really have eliminated all material evidence so completely, including \nmaking the ashes of six million people vanish from the locations at which \nthey must have been interred. To think such doubts is to engage in thought \ncrime.\"\n\n\"The reality, therefore, is that the bulk of the ' evidence' for the \nHolocaust derives from a corpus of documents that was expressly \nmanufactured by the OSS and OCC in 1945-46 for the purpose of incriminating \nthe leaders of the former German government at Nuremberg. The procedure \nwent roughly along these lines: the Documentation Division in Paris created \n' copies' (in English only), certified them as true, and sent them to the \nprosecution in Nuremberg, while the original documents (if they ever \nexisted) were never seen or heard of again. German translations of the \noriginal English texts were then prepared and sent to the defense in \nNuremberg, where they arrived as late as possible so that the defense had \ninsufficient time to worry about such matters as their authenticity.\"\n\n\"Starting in May 1945 with the alleged suicides of SS-General Hans-Adolf \nPr\u00fctzmann, SS head Heinrich Himmler and SS-General Odilo Globocnik while in \nBritish captivity, there followed a bizarre string of murders of \nindividuals associated with the Auschwitz concentration camp. (These were \nperpetrated by a Jewish hit squad known as the DIN.) As Joseph Bellinger, \nauthor of a new book on Himmler's murder, points out, within six months or \nso of the war's end practically any one who could have shed light on the \nJewish policy of the Third Reich was murdered!\"\n\nThis, it must be said, was extremely convenient for the prosecution at \nNuremberg.\n\nAt Nuremberg, the German war-generals as well as being tortured had their \nwives arrested, to dissuade them from making inappropriate remarks in \ncourt. They were kept in solitary confinement to prevent their comparing \nnotes, as each was presented with the Great Untruth and asked to believe \nit. Finally, most of them were hanged, by a court which felt free to invent \nnew laws, and to act as prosecutor, judge, lawyer and executioner: American \njustice!\n\nAt Nuremberg, invoices for the delivery of Zyklon-B were presented as \nevidence for human \"gassings.\" [47]The normal, routine purpose and function \nof the Zyklon-B as an insecticide[48]was more or less completely omitted: \nthe manufacture of the ten-cubic metre \"gaskammer\" (gas chambers) by the \nfirm DEGESCH, for which the Zyklon-B was designed in order to delouse \nclothes and bedding, as part of the great struggle against typhus, was \noverlooked. Throughout the German labour-camps these chambers \u2013 installed \nin 1942 when the scourge of typhus arrived \u2013 consumed tons of Zyklon-B, and \nthey can still today be visited, in the camps of Majdanek and Auschwitz, \ntheir walls a deep turquoise-blue due to saturation with iron-cyanide. \nThese chambers are a lot smaller than the ones which tourists are taken \nround as alleged-human gas chambers.\n\nAt Nuremberg, the \"gas chamber\" illusion was perpetrated by conflating two \ndifferent types of chamber. The little disinfection-rooms were properly \ndesigned with efficient fans, tight-fitting doors, heaters to make the \nZyklon-B evaporate quickly, and ducts and tall chimneys to remove the \ndeadly gas. The morgues were the opposite \u2013 long, cold and damp, built \npartly below ground to keep them cool, having only slow ventilation, no \nholes in the roof for you-know-what, and a large table down the middle for \nlaying stiffs on, prior to their being taken to the cremation ovens next \ndoor. These morgues (or sometimes a washroom), were strangely re-imagined \nas human gas chambers, while the actual, real, working gas-chambers became \nforgotten. Such phantoms became alluded to as \"Kremas,\" a vague term \nsuitable for rooms that never existed.[49]\n\nComing of the Truthseekers\n\nIn the postwar years, anyone claiming to have a personal memory of the \nGerman gas-chambers would be liable to have Paul Rassinier turn up on their \ndoorstep. Having himself experienced the hell of the Buchenwald camp he was \nfar from being a fan of the Nazis; but, neither was he prepared to endure \nfabricated stories on the subject. He spent years travelling about Europe \nwith his tape-recorder and questions, but always he found that the \nwitnesses came out with \"evasions or palpable lies,\" and his published \nreport concluded:\n\n\"With regard to the gas chambers, the almost endless procession of false \nwitnesses and of falsified documents to which I have drawn the reader's \nattention during this long study, proves, nevertheless, one thing: never at \nany moment did the responsible authorities of the Third Reich intend to \norder \u2013 or in fact order \u2013 the extermination of the Jews in this or any \nother manner.\"[50]\n\nThat bold conclusion (for which he was, naturally, jailed) kick-started the \n\"revisionist\" movement! We may here note that the money which the FRG keeps \npaying out to \"holocaust survivors\" does enormous damage here, in \nstimulating \"memories\" and generating such averred cases. \n\nRobert Faurisson investigated the configuration of the alleged Auschwitz \n\"gas chambers,\" then Zundel[51]got to hear of this. At a historic 1985 \ntrial in Toronto, witnesses were grilled for the first time ever over the \nexistence of the alleged \"gas chambers,\" and it was found that no such \ntestimony would stand up. On the fourth day of this trial, a marvellous \nclimax was reached when Zundel's lawyer Doug Christie put these questions \nto a top \"Holocaust\" expert Dr Raul Hillberg, author of the multi-volume, \nmulti-edition work, The Destruction of the European Jews:\n\n\nChristie: Can you give me one scientific report that shows the existence of \ngas chambers anywhere in Nazi-occupied territory?\n\nHilberg: I'm at a loss.\n\nChristie: You are [at a loss] because you can't. I want one report, before, \nduring or after the war that shows that someone was killed by the use of \nthose gases.\n\nHilberg: You want an autopsy [report] and I know of no autopsy.[52]\n\n- he could not cite one scientific report! That surely remains the case \ntoday; as likewise he could provide no evidence for a single death as \ndiagnosed due to cyanide poisoning, even though the symptoms of this are \nquite distinctive.\n\n\n\nFaurisson was an advisor to Zundel in this trial, and a subsequent one, and \nthis duo just kept on winning the arguments. The prosecution could come up \nwith no credible witnesses for a gas-chamber's existence:[53]\n\n\n\"in 1988, during the second trial against Ernst Z\u00fcndel, the public \nprosecutor deemed it prudent to abandon any recourse to witnesses. Canadian \njustice had apparently understood the lesson of the first trial: there were \nno credible witnesses to the existence and operation of the ' Nazi gas \nchambers.' Little by little, every other country in the world has learned \nthis same lesson. At the trial of Klaus Barbie in France, in 1987, there \nwas talk about the gas chambers of Auschwitz but no one produced any \nwitnesses who could properly speak about them. All the while in France, \nduring several revisionist trials, Jewish witnesses sometimes came to evoke \nthe gas chambers but none of them testified before the court as to having \nseen one or having participated in a homicidal gassing by hauling bodies \nout of the 'gas chambers.'\n\n\"Today, gas chamber witnesses are making themselves extremely scarce and \nthe Demjanjuk trial in Israel, which once again has revealed how much false \ntestimony is involved in the matter, has contributed to the suppression. \nSeveral years ago, it happened that I was aggressively questioned at the \nrear of a law court by elderly Jews who presented themselves as 'living \nwitnesses to the gas chambers of Auschwitz', showing me their tattoos. It \nwas necessary for me only to ask them to look me in the eyes and to \ndescribe for me a gas chamber that inevitably they retorted: 'How could I \ndo this? If I had seen a gas chamber with my own eyes I would not be here \ntoday to speak with you; I myself would have been gassed also.'\"\n\nThe study of history cannot exist without dissenting views, and who would \nwant to read a history journal that did not allow this? One fails to \nunderstand why \"revisionism\" should be reprehensible, and Jews especially \nshould be relieved to discover that their ancestors were never subject to \nsuch a horror. Bestselling author David Irving, who has written over a \ndozen books on WWII, was recently jailed[54]. His definitive, 700- page \nblockbuster Hitler's War gave no hint that the Fuhrer ever got to hear of a \ngas chamber, or gave any extermination command! Irving is known for the \ncare with which he checks out his primary-source material. In 1991 his \npublisher, Macmillan, destroyed all their copies of his books. Irving has \npaid quite a price for the truth he discovered.\n\nIn November 1991 Fred Leuchter was about to speak at Chelsea Town Hall \n(invited by David Irving), when he was arrested onstage by the police at \nthe request of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and deported back to \nthe United States. So much for freedom of speech. When his trailblazing \n\"Leuchter Report\" was first published in 1989, the House of Commons \ndenounced it as \"Nazi propaganda\" and a \"fascist publication\" (on July \n20th, with 100 MPs voting). Even the House of Commons, however, cannot \nalter the laws of chemistry: the durability of the ferrocyanide ion is now \npivotal to the Holocaust debate! \n\nWe are not likely to get important insights unless the \"thoughtcrime\" \npenalty is lifted from the German people, and they are allowed to review \ntheir own past. The definitive modern textbook, Dissecting the Holocaust \nhas chapters by some twenty different authors over six hundred pages.[55]In \n1995 the German Government demanded that all copies be confiscated and \nburnt![56]Edited by Germar Rudolf, it draws its inspiration from the \npioneer labours of Ernst Zundel. While in Tennessee and publishing \n\"revisionist\" material, he was seized by the police and thrown into \nsolitary confinement in a Canadian jail[57]. After two years he was \ntransferred to Germany, where his trial now progresses. He recently \n(October 2006) read to the court an open letter from the Iranian president \nto Germany's chancellor \u2013 to the judge's fury. The letter said, in effect, \nthat Germany had been on its knees before Zion for fifty years and it was \ntime to get up[58]. \n\nForbidden Doubt and Fictional Horror \n\nDoubt anything in our modern world, scoff at sacred texts, no-one will care \n\u2013 except that one kind of doubt is forbidden to you, which will land you in \njail\u2026 in ten different nations! You can read the Hammer-horror account in, \ne.g., Auschwitz by Lawrence Rees (2005): every hour or so, a thousand naked \nJews were marched (somehow) into a room with space for maybe one or two \nhundred, the doors are locked, then the Zyklon-B is poured down special \nchutes or holes in the ceiling (which did not exist in the war, they were \nadded later), then after the screaming stops \"powerful fans\" remove the \npoison gas. In your dreams, Mr Rees. There were no such powerful fans. But, \nthen what? The mass of bodies will be mixed up with the Zyklon-B, and that \nis specifically designed to keep emitting the cyanide gas slowly. How is \nanyone supposed to shovel out this tortured mass of corpses mixed up with \npoison powder? Remember there are only ordinary-sized doors, mostly opening \ninwards. Its an unthinkable nightmare that could not possibly have worked, \nand would certainly have gassed any workers trying to operate it. It is the \n\"safe\" design of this insecticide material, which would have prevented it \nfrom functioning in this deliriously-imagined manner.\n\nNo German government existed after the war, that was the \"unconditional \nsurrender\" which the Allies demanded. By losing both its senior military \nstaff and government, Germany was in effect decapitated \u2013 necessary for the \nillusory version of events to be perpetrated. The verdicts of Nuremberg \nwere made final and binding for the postwar FRG. Germany has since paid a \nhundred billion Deutschmarks to Israel by way of Holocaust-compensation. \nGermany should take the advice of Iranian leader Ahmadinajad and stop \npaying it, because that funding provides undue motivation for holocaust \n\"memories.\" Germany is helping to maintain the holocaust legend, by thus \naiding the state of Israel.[59]\n\nThe United Nations has now established its annual Holocaust Remembrance Day \non 27 January, as of 2006. On this anniversary, we all need to mull over \nthe faking of history and the Greatest Lie Ever Told. As Perseus gazed at \nthe Medusa only via a mirror, to avoid being petrified, to too we need calm \nreflection and the power of Truth to avoid our collective destruction.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotes\n\nRevised 05/24/08\n\n[1] www. thetruthseeker.co.uk/article.asp?ID=5588 \n[2] Fred Leuchter, Auschwitz: the First Forensic Examination of Auschwitz: \nLondon, 1989; 1988, Toronto. \nwww.zundelsite.org/english/basic_articles/inside.html For debate, see: \nwww.codoh.com(info)/gcgv/gc426v12.html \n[3] http://vho.org/GB/Books/trr/ \n[4] www.takeourworldback.com/short/rudolfarrested.htm \n[5] . http://vho.org/GB/Books/trr/ , www. \ndailynorthwestern.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2006/02/14/43f1778c0f7e0 \n[6] www.vho.org/GB/Books/dth/fndgcger.html \n[7] www.zundelsite.org/english/debate/014_jam.html In 1990 the Krakow \nForensic Institute obtained somewhat lower values: their brick samples from \nAuschwitz \"gas chambers\" gave a maximum of 0.6 parts per million of \ncyanide, ie, hardly a trace: \nwww.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/polish/institute-for-forensic-research/table-three.html \n[8] www.rense.com/general53/aauz.htm , \nwww.ihr.org/jhr/v15/v15n1p23_Weber.html Staglich, p.265. \n[9] http:// judicial-inc.biz/Auschwitz.htm \n[10] Dittlieb Felderer, Anne Frank's diary a Hoax, IHR CA 1979 , p.1; \nwww.radioislam.org/annefrank/. \n[11] In the German Endl\u00f6sung, \"end\" signifies \"goal\" and \"aim\" , at least \nas much as \"final. \" \n[12] The minutes of the Wannsee Conference (Berlin, 20th January 1942) \nprovide \"unambiguous documentary evidence that no extermination program \nexisted:\" Butz, p.212;.

In 1979 I went through the Police \nAcademy with a group of guys that were going to be Prison Guards at the \nnearby State Prison.  Most of us were just going to be cops or deputies in \nour Rural County in Central California.  the Zimbardo Experiment was \nbriefly discussed and added to the warnings given to the Correctional Guys \nabout not becoming \"institutionalized\" from living around inmates about 200 \nhours a month.  Now that I'm a lot older and a little bit wiser I've had \nfriends and family members working in Corrections.  I still ask them to \nread a bit about the Zimbardo Experiment of the 70's because it truly is an \neye opener.  Google it as the \"Stanford Prison Experiments\" and maybe \nincrease your understanding of the \"us and them\" effect of Police work and \nespecially Correctional Work.  If you are a true human being of good will \nit should also frighten you a bit...\ufeff",
