He started out \nrecording cassette tapes in his bedroom and mailing them to Doctor Demento \nwho played them on his show. Have you ever met Al? I think it would be \ngreat if you could collaborate on a song with him with him on accordion and \nyou on guitar (maybe you could invite me to play bass \u2013 tuba).\n\nNow about this song: Is it a hint of something to come? Like maybe a \nparallel cousin for Henry and Alice. (I learned about parallel cousins from \nCGP Grey.)\n\nLoved seeing you at the Glass House in Pomona, CA along with \"Harry and the \nPotters\" and \"Driftless Pony Club\" (Craig \"Wheezy Waiter\" Benzine's band). \nIn your song \"I F@#%ing Love Science\" there is one line that sounds like \n\"\u2026mammary foam beds\u2026\" Were you trying to throw in a double entendre?\n\nI love you and John and wish you were both were the brothers I didn't have.\n\nTake care and I know you will never forget to be awesome, because you are \naways awesome.\n\nCharles\ufeff",
