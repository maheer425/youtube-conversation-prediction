            "text": "Have women been mostly unspoken in history? Yes. However, the sum of the \nreasons why is because, comparatively, women didn't accomplish nearly as \nmuch as men. It's fact we were the majority of the engineers, the \narchitects, the soldiery, the poets, the writers, the historians and the \ngovernors. This isn't misogyny: this is cold hard unflinching fact. Women \ndidn't do that much, because they could get men to do all those things for \nthem: while women dealt with--due to the pragmatic division of labor that \nonly intensifies in metropolitan societies, as seen with the Romans when \ncompared to, say, the celts or the norse--women dealt more with the equally \ncrucial task of maintaining the household and rearing the family. This is \nthe classic division of labor. Women didn't chose to pursue official \nauthority because it was a lethal enterprise compared to engaging in a \nconsensual social contract that guaranteed their protection, provision and \ncomfort. It's only recently in history that women are demanding their civil \nrights with such fervor; and it's heavily influenced by the ease of \ncivilization. Men, as a majoritive scientific and official political force, \nfinally built a society that's politically stable and technologically \naccessible to women. \n\n This is not to say women were lazy, far from it: female value however was \nand is just more of a given in traditional society. Men are forced to \ncompete and to obsess over competition in a way that dwarfs women in terms \nof blood spilled. This isn't an issue men are responsible any more than \nwomen are, because they both make up two halves of a society inspiring this \nbehavior. \n\n However, going back to the immediate subject--pardon the non sequitr into \ngender politics---the truth is for every man given even a cursory nod in \nhistory text books, a hundred are left unspoken: we mention Aristotle, but \nwe glance at Archimedes. We, occasionally, both with Ptolemy but we rarely \nmention Pythagoras. Tsebius, the man who invented the goddamn alarm \nclock--who singlehandedly revolutionized the government of society--is \nnever even considered!

            "text": "This video has actually offended my sensibilities enough that I want to \nreply.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, I will address each remark in turn, and add \nfurther commentary where I feel it is helpful.\n\nThe text is reproduced below; there is also a Pastebin link here (older \nversion):\n\nhttp://pastebin.com/3jwghnTV\n\nIn the first place, as regards the concept of \u2018great\u2019 or \u2018greatness\u2019, we \nshould keep Nietzsche in mind, who of course said: \u201cTerribleness is part of \ngreatness: let us not deceive ourselves.\u201d It is completely possible for a \nking or tyrant to be terrible and yet not great, but the reverse does not \nhold: greatness presupposes terribleness, a willingness to inflict harm and \npain and even death upon others for the purpose of achieving one\u2019s goals in \nlife; and still more, it presupposes a willingness to suffer these things \noneself.\n\nAlexander was by any appraisal a relatively mild and humane king. The \nmurder of Kleitos is often cited as proof of his corruption and insanity, \nbut by ancient and modern standards, there were relatively few massacres \nperpetrated by Alexander\u2019s troops on their long campaign (Alexander \ninstantly and deeply regretted killing Kleitos in a drunken brawl). Cities \nand armies that surrendered were granted pardon; those that fought and \nbetrayed Alexander\u2019s trust perished.\n\nIn all his years of conquest, Alexander never took any person as booty or \nas a \u2018war prize\u2019. The eunuch of Darius, Bagoas, was a gift to him from a \nPersian governor, and Alexander retained him out of mutual affection.\n\nThe whole argument about \u2018greatness\u2019 being inherently misogynistic or \nmale-centric is nonsense. Very few people in history have ever held that \ntitle or had their name passed down to posterity with the title intact \u2013 \nthis goes for men as well as women. The fact of the matter is that there \nhave been extremely few female conquerors and high ranking monarchs \nthroughout history, and the reasons for this could not be more obvious. \nWarfare was and remains the business of men; those who would make \nthemselves masters of the battlefield must be willing and able to fight \nalongside their soldiers, or at any rate to lead them in combat.\n\nThe taming of Oxhead is a true story; the remark by Phillip to Alexander \nafterwards is apocryphal. Phillip fully intended to be the first Greek King \nto conquer lands in Asia; while Phillip lived, Alexander could hope for no \nbetter than to be a major general in his Macedonian army.\n\nThe three definitions of greatness are worth considering, but unfortunately \nthey are not properly addressed here. The lens of modernity is far too \nclouded to allow accurate appraisal of Alexander\u2019s legacy, firstly because \nof the remoteness of the subject and his life, and secondly because the \ncontemporary attitude towards monarchs, wars of conquest, grandeur and so \non is decidedly negative. In our time where kings and kingcraft are bound \nto seem a trifle preposterous (if not downright immoral) it is difficult \nfor anyone to understand the mentality of those who lived during and after \nthe time of Alexander. Like every other great conqueror in history, whether \nRamses or Xerxes or Caesar or Napoleon, Alexander today would surely be put \non trial for various war crimes, genocide and the like. It is therefore \nimpossible, starting from this perspective, to appraise him honestly.\n\nNo serious military historian would contend that Alexander was anything \nless than a brilliant commander. His invention and use of superior \nimplements was just another part of this brilliance. His real genius was in \norganizing and deploying various squadrons in battle, and rearranging these \non the fly. He could move an entire division of archers or horsemen from \none side of a vast plain to the other in a flash. More than anything, his \nlightning speed and tactical thinking was what enabled him to win in the \nface of wildly lopsided odds.\n\nThe comments about Alexander\u2019s empire building ability are also \nmisinformed. Alexander was very intelligent when it came to matters of \nstatecraft. Wherever possible, he tried to leave the existing structure of \ncivilization and government intact, changing perhaps a few key officials in \norder to maintain control over the conquered areas. Wherever he destroyed, \nhe also created: the many cities that bore his name, several of which still \nexist today, are a testament to that. Moreover, it is something of an \nexaggeration to say that Alexander simply crushed the Persian Empire and \nmoved on. Persian control of the lands within its borders was by no means \nabsolute; all throughout the empire, there were provinces and peoples who \nfought amongst one another, refused to pay taxes, raided and looted \nagricultural settlements, and so on. In short, there was at least as much \nchaos before Alexander arrived as there was after he left. The difference \nwas that, as a roving monarch, Alexander could and often enough would mount \na force to bring dissenting tribes and cities to heel before his imperial \npower. His empire came apart at the seams not because it was poorly \nconstructed, but because it absolutely had to have a monarch on the order \nof Alexander to preside over it. There was no one else who could combine \nthe traits necessary of a Great King and essential to a general as \nAlexander did. No one else could control the Macedonian army or keep the \nvarious governors and lesser kings in line. Cyrus lived an additional 30 \nyears after his conquests were finished, but it still only took Alexander a \nlustrum to topple his empire.\n\nAs regards Alexander\u2019s presence and power in death, there is a great \narticle by Lauren O\u2019Conner under the title of \u2018Constructing the Past. The \nRemains of Alexander the Great: The God, The King, The Symbol.\u2019 I highly \nrecommend anyone who is interested in Alexander\u2019s posthumous travels and \ninfluence to consult it.\n\nAlexander\u2019s policy of Perso-Grecian fusion receives surprisingly little \nattention in our time, considering the present obsession with \u2018diversity\u2019 \nand multiculturalism. Unlike most all conquering autocrats, Alexander \nattempted to preserve rather than purge the existing culture of the peoples \nhe conquered. He was very much enamored with the Persian title of Great \nKing or \u2018Shahanshah\u2019, and with Persian customs in general. As he spent more \ntime among the Persians, he began to look critically on the coarseness of \nhis fellow Macedonians.\n\nThe motivations that drove Alexander are a subject of much speculation and \nscholarly debate, and it betrays a want of perspective to simply attribute \nhis drive to vainglory. Author Tony Buzan has said: \"[Alexander's] goal in \nconquering the world was not simply to conquer the world, it wasn't [about] \npower; it was to acquire knowledge, and then to disseminate knowledge. He \nwanted to know everything, to have seen everything, and he wanted to have \ndone everything\". The influence of his tutor, Aristotle, is evident in this.\n\nAnother pathetically simplistic appraisal involves the assumption that all \nhistorical legends contain exaggeration. At any rate, this still cleaves \nboth ways: not only are famous people celebrated in bombastic tones, they \nare also subject to bitter slander and defamation by those who despise them \nor their accomplishments. Both sides have influenced the legacy of \nAlexander that comes down to us. In addition to this, Alexander has an \nentire series of mythological travels and battles to his credit, called the \n\u2018Alexander Romance\u2019. But more serious historians such as Arrian worked very \nhard to separate fact from fiction, examining source material which \nunfortunately is no longer available today.\n\nAlexander\u2019s pursuit of Darius is misrepresented here. After the disaster at \nGaugamela, Darius III was deposed by a coalition of lesser nobles and \nchiefs, Bessos foremost among them. From this point forward, Darius had no \nactual power; he was a prisoner conveyed hither and thither by Bessos as \nthe latter retreated to keep away from Alexander. Alexander pursued Darius \nbecause, even after he had been deposed, Alexander still saw him as the \ntrue King of Persia, and wanted to legitimize his succession to that \nthrone. In this respect he was certainly influenced by Darius\u2019 own mother, \nSisygambis. We will have something to say about her later.\n\nAlexander\u2019s subsequent pursuit of Bessos is easy to understand. As he had \nby then become King of Persia, Alexander wanted to punish Bessos for his \ncrimes against Darius, namely treason and regicide. There is nothing \ncomical about it, either. Bessos commanded a significant force even after \nDarius was assassinated, and did his best to stir up local leaders to \nrevolt against Alexander. He was thus not merely a large thorn in \nAlexander\u2019s side, but also a significant liability.\n\nIt is quite interesting how at no point in this video does the narrator \nmention or attempt to debate Alexander\u2019s sexuality. Indeed, based on the \naccount given in this video alone, it would be quite easy to assume that \nAlexander was another heterosexual (white) male megalomaniac who took \nliberties with the women he had power over. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth. Alexander\u2019s lifelong partner and the one who meant the most to \nhim was a boyhood friend called Hephaestion. The two were deeply intimate \nand almost certainly lovers. However, we must take care not to impose \ncategories of sexual orientation and disposition onto peoples who had no \nnotion of these. The concept of heterosexuality and homosexuality had no \nparlance in the ancient world; the distinction in Greece and Rome was only \nbetween the active (penetrating) participant and the passive (penetrated).\n\nRoxana, for clarity, was not Persian but Bactrian. Alexander\u2019s Persian wife \nwas called Stateira, and she was poisoned by Roxana shortly after \nAlexander\u2019s death while several months pregnant. Stateira was the daughter \nof Darius III and the granddaughter of Sisygambis. Her sister, Drypetis, \nwas married to Hephaestion, and murdered alongside Stateira.\n\nAgain with the matter of Alexander\u2019s death, the narrator\u2019s insolence \ndistorts his presentation of the facts. Alexander\u2019s death remains a topic \nof hot contention not because of enduring attempts to lionize him, but \nbecause there are sharply conflicting accounts. The debate rages whether \nAlexander died of fever, of poisoning, or of both. Crucial to this debate \nis the timetable of his decline and death, which is also not made clear by \nextant accounts. The date and rough time of Alexander\u2019s death is certain, \nbut the days leading up to this are not. Some say he was taken ill after \ndowning a heavy chalice of wine; some say that he fell sick after wading \nthrough the marshes around Babylon and died several days later. Of \nparticular interest is Kassandros, son of the Macedonian regent Antipatros, \nand longtime enemy of Alexander. When Antipatros was summoned to Babylon, \nhe sent his son instead; the latter was then brought in contact with his \nbrother, Iollas, Alexander\u2019s royal cupbearer. Later, Kassandros would wage \nwar against the successors of Alexander, have Alexander\u2019s mother killed, \nand poison Alexander\u2019s wife Roxana alongside her adolescent son, Alexander \nIV, heir to the throne of Macedon.\n\nAgain, the \u2018masculine bias\u2019 of history is a largely inane topic, and I \nthink we can leave it aside while discussing Alexander. The most notable \nand noble female figure in Alexander\u2019s orbit was undoubtedly Sisygambis, \nmother of the deposed Persian king Darius III. When Alexander captured her \nand her tent following the Battle of Issus, they spent a great deal of time \nconversing together about matters of statecraft and conquest. Sisygambis \nwould later disown her real son in death and adopt Alexander; Alexander for \nhis part held her in higher regard even than his own mother, Olympias. \nSpeaking his mind later in life, he said of Sisygambis: \u201cthere is the Great \nKing who would have led your people (the Persians) to prosperity and \nglory\u201d. When Alexander died, Sisygambis promptly locked herself away and \nrefused nutriment, expiring just a few days later.\n\nThe limited amount of scholarship that went into creating this video is \nbetrayed further by the remarks on Alexander\u2019s Roman legacy. Pompey might \nhave imitated his hairstyle, but the most fervent devotee of Alexander was \nundoubtedly Emperor Caracalla, who believed himself to be Alexander \nreincarnated, going so far as to deploy his troops in outdated Macedonian \ngear and formations. He also had several philosophers of the Aristotelian \nschool put to the sword on the belief that Aristotle had had a hand in \npoisoning Alexander.\n\nAs a very brief rebuttal to the conclusion of this video, I would only say \nthat Alexander made himself great through his deeds, his passions, his \ndreams, and his style of kingship. The legend that surrounds him is in \nconsequence of these; it did not develop out of nothing. Alexander was for \nmany people of many persuasions a paragon, an ideal, and a hero who \nmotivated them to strive for greatness in their own lives. He had \ntremendous energy and stamina, almost beyond belief; he was also deeply \ncompassionate, arranging his forces in such a way as to always minimize \ncasualties, and when casualties were had, he would wander the camp and \npersonally attend on his wounded comrades. Shortly before his death, the \nveterans among his army recoiled at the idea of being separated from him \neven though many of them were past their sixth decade of life. \n\nArrian, among the most prominent Alexander historians, closes his account \nof Alexander\u2019s campaigns with the following admonition:\n\n\u201cAnyone who reproaches Alexander should not simply cite those deeds that \ndeserve to be reproached. Instead, after collecting in one place all of \nAlexander\u2019s qualities, let his critic then consider who he is and what sort \nof fortune he has had that he reproaches Alexander, a man who became so \ngreat and attained such a peak of human success as undisputed king of both \ncontinents whose name reached every land \u2013 whereas he is a lesser man, \ntoiling at lesser things and not even handling them with any ability.\u201d\ufeff",

Where in the \nentry, they would ask the people \"\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03c2\" \"where are you seated\", and a \nhomosexual slang in Greece now is \"\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2\" which refers to that fact.",
