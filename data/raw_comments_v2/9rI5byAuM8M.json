Judging from what max did to \njenna, you can tell that this observation is not so far off. Both \nboyfriends have the same humor as Jenna but I felt like Max and Jenna felt \nlike two \"bros\" of the relationship if you get what I mean. From, watching \nJulien vids you can tell he is the much calmer of the two and not as wild \nas Jenna thus creating a balance relationship. ",
