They detail your view on art \nin the section known as \"humanistic criticism\", which most certainly \nexists. You're also taking the word \"humanistic\" too literally in this \ncontext.\n\nAlso, art is not an inherently positive term. Don't call something art \nbecause you think it is good. Art is just the byproduct of human \ncreativity. It can be good, or it can be bad. Pulp Fiction is art, and if \nyou don't like it, say it's \"bad art\" don't say it's not art. The \ndefinition of art should not be subjective.\n\nPulp Fiction is \"art\" because it's a film, which is an art form, and thus \nall films are art. To say otherwise is to be pretentious. The \ncinematography, the characters, the post-modern approach to crime films and \nnoir, etc, that's what gives Pulp Fiction depth and worth. Like I said, \nyour view of art is myopic and needs to be expanded.
