Charles Moore of the Algalita Marine Research Foundation \nhttp://www.algalita.org/ first discovered the Great Pacific Garbage Patch \u2014 \nan endless floating waste of plastic trash. Now he's drawing attention to \nthe growing, choking problem of plastic debris in our seas.\n\n*Why you should listen:*\nA yachting competition across the Pacific led veteran seafarer Charles \nMoore to discover what some have since deemed the world's largest \n\"landfill\" -- actually a huge water-bound swath of floating plastic garbage \ntwo times the size of Texas. Trapped in an enormous slow whirlpool called \nthe Pacific Gyre, a mostly stagnant, plankton-rich seascape spun of massive \ncompeting air currents, this Great Pacific Garbage Patch in some places \noutweighs even the surface waters' biomass six-to-one.\n\nMoore said after his return voyage, \"There were shampoo caps and soap \nbottles and plastic bags and fishing floats as far as I could see. Here I \nwas in the middle of the ocean, and there was nowhere I could go to avoid \nthe plastic.\"\n\nSince his discovery, Moore has been analyzing the giant litter patch and \nits disastrous effects on ocean life. Through the Algalita Marine Research \nFoundation, he hopes to raise awareness about the problem and find ways to \nrestrict its growth. He's now leading several expeditions to sample plastic \nfragments across thousands of miles of the Pacific.\ufeff",
