            "text": "This movie is so brilliant and so under rated truly one of the best movies I have seen for many years The vampire is just the outer shell of the story it talks about mostly love and identity crisis Identity crisis within not only the second generation immigrants but also amongst the Iranian nation itself The film maker is very careful not to attach the story to Islam or politics the background library in her room has all kinds of books specially the book from the Iranian poet Hafez I did not see any Koran in the background this shows another element of identity crisis that Iranians in Iran are involved with being an Iranian Persian or Muslim Another strong base for this movie is its outstanding soundtrack I have no idea how she came up with such a collection that make sense so much Cinematography is also very interesting and unique it gives you the feeling of reading comic books This movie is unlike what you have seen so far if you are a typical vampire movie fan you wont enjoy it as much The movie director and writer is female so for sure the movie is feminist But keep in mind that the back bone of the story is Iran where sexual harassment of women on the streets is so usual and obvious that even women don t realize it anymore I was always wondering what would happened if one of those women on the streets of Tehran was a Vampire Watch it "

            "text": "Global Warming is a real occurrence I m no scientist and so I m not sure as to if it s affecting us but I take your word my problem comes on the matter of why you care My point is that Global Warming has happened several times before Humanity even existed So one cannot say we re the cause all the time Because history proves that we re not the cause One may be stupid as to say we re aiding Global Warming when in reality one Volcano can have the same amount of Co2 as 20 years of the current collective world s car s output In truth we re still emerging from an Ice age and so the Climate will be diverse an sometimes even dangerous but this is Nature We have no right trying to change Nature When we are more advanced we may have a chance at changing things like the Climates As for now at least I think we should stay the hell away from the fear mongering and misconceptions One misconception is the fact people seem to think we can stop climate change Left Winged supernugs like the Greens party in Britain is one they believe if China and India and America chipped into a clean energy program all these problems will go away Yet they fail to realize what green energy has done for Britain it s self and you can be sure it s coming straight for the US There is one Green energy program that may be beneficial in time to come when we have the capacity to make them more efficient and that s solar but as it stands my country is hell bent on creating idiotic anti efficient Wind Mills and farms which only work through Winter and cost the tax payer Billion s to support We in the West need a reality check and by cutting our industry and Co2 WE DO NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM Despite the industries flooding to the East because we have excessive Carbon taxes yet we forget the UK is covered with farmland and so the animals that inhabit our plains are just as intoxicating to our climate you d also have to kill them to cut air pollution they emit Methane a much more potent Green house gas than Co2 is the West willing to do this also The truth is we really have no way of stopping Climate change up or down We re like ants trying to cut a lawn and for now at least we should try to advance in order to control at the moment we are useless But to those who preach God wouldn t allow Climate change and all this Just STFU and watch the video you may actually learn something "

            "text": "I thnk more countries should follow our The UKs methods of arming police We have 2 very distinct types of Cops normal police and Armed Response Units ARU The normal cops dont carry guns and I think we are the only country in the world that has that what they have is a collapsible baton pepper spray cuffs stab proof vest the rest of the little bits and pieces that cops carry like notebooks etc and now most of them carry a taser gun but thats under question so they are not armed that much and the death rates for both Police and Criminals is a lot lower that the majority of countries However there is a big difference in how the ARU are armed you Americans arent gonna like the next bit as I know you are as proud of your troops as we are of ours but I have to say it each ARU officer is as well trained as the average american soldier and they are equipped in looks like the SAS and Delta force They wear all their gear in black they have big bullet proof vests adn helmets they carry a side arm which i think is a sig like most British government things are a Assault rifle some carry smoke and flash bangs flash bangs is incredibly unlikely baton taser and cuffs and there will usually be a few with a ballistics shield But even when these guys are called in they still dont all ways try and kill there target they usually shoot to wound which i think is something important now if you know anything about the London riots a few years back it should be how easily they started the ARU killed someone Now this wasnt that they killed an innocent black teen they shot a criminal suspect who they knew had a gun thinking he was reaching for it There were 2 vehicles 1 with the teen in teh other with ARU as the cops got along side the teen was seen to have reached for the gun so the ARU officer did what he thought he had to to protect himself and hes fellow officers he shot the teen and killed him This kicked off some of the worst riots Britain had ever seen in London Birmingham and Manchester along with a few other cities This is where another change comes in we dont have our riot cops armed with guns they have a shield and baton they can have guns for rubber bullets but that where the difference is even though these riots were very bad they still didnt end up using rubber bullets in northern Island there are still a few water cannons for riots but thats about as extreme as it gets in Britain Now i know in america you couldn t have you street cops without guns as you have very relaxed guns laws and i dont have an opinion on how our ARU or your SWAT should be equipped but its the training now I m not saying you need them trained to the same standard as outs but i think you need to start training your street cops and your SWAT to shoot to wound but in all honestly with the recent footage of 8 shots being put into an innocent mans back I think your entire police training needs to be reformed and if you dont have it as federal then make it federal cause it should not be a thing you guys manage state to state "

            "text": "Not being funny but lets take a look at the UK people think of our police as not carrying firearms We have specialist firearm units when we need them but we didn t have that kind years ago in the 1930 s to 50 s one or two officers would be allowed to carry a firearm but they would never use it and it would be an if they need it tool But as time has gone on people have become more and more violent became better armed and criminal organizations have became better organized as a result firearm units have became a more common sight The transport police which protect airports train striations the underground and other places which are to do with transport where similar uniforms to normal officers but instead of wearing a stab vest they have a beefier bullet proof vest but it is high vis green like normal officers not tactical black they carry a number of military firearm including Glock 17 Glock 26 Walter P99 SIG Sauer P226 H K USP H K MP5SF H K G36 LMT AR15 H K G3 Remington 870 SIG 550 SIG 551 SIG 553 H K417 H K416C And many other firearm all these firearm have been used by Military around the world We also have plenty of other firearm units not just the transport police firearm units there is the CNC Civil Nuclear Constabulary which protect nuclear power plants transport radioactive materials and so on Belfast Harbour Police which protect Belfast harbour though they only carry handgun s and rely on the Belfast constabulary firearm unit for more fire power Every constabulary have their own firearm unit and there is SCO19 They are the scary tactical black militarized police everyone talks about they are Scotland Yard s specialist firearm unit for responding to high stakes incidence where you need special forces operators more than you need a police officer they train literally like special forces operators and pretty much are in everything but name But the question is WHY do we need them and the answer is do you want a normal police officer coming to help when you need it Or do you want a specially trained well equipped officer coming Lets just go though two scenario s Number one its 1949 and a small town constabulary have 30 officers but only 2 revolvers in the entire force a local man takes his privately owned double barrel shotgun and shoots his wife dead takes his 2 children hostage and barricades himself in their family home 17 officers respond and only 2 have firearm so you have 2 not very well trained officers who have probably only fired 12 shots out the Webley Mk VI Revolver they have been given and 15 officers sat around twiddling their thumbs they negotiated with him for 3 hours and in the end he shoots his two kids and himself Now number two its 2015 and a local man takes his privately owned double barrel shotgun and shoots his wife dead takes his 2 children hostage and barricades himself in their family home 17 officers respond unarmed all 17 are sat around twiddling but they negotiate with the man while they wait for the firearm unit to respond 10 or more highly trained skilled and well equipped officers take 30 minuets to get to get to the scene A skilled negotiator is on scene and incident command is taking care of everything after an hour the situation seems hopeless the firearm unit gets the go ahead and they throw flashbang thunder flash as you will commonly hear it called here and make entry to the house in a lightening raid lasting 40 second to a minuet they have maimed the suspect saved the hostages and ended the crisis there is a big difference Now armed officers are used differently in the US to the UK but the concept is still the same we have gotten armed officers because we MIGHT need them at some point Hope my contribution is useful "

            "text": "The difference between a police officer and a soldier boils down to the mandate each receives in regards to the use of force Police Officers at all times have a mandate to preserve life and may only use lethal force in defense of that mandate Soldiers meanwhile have a mandate to engage the enemy with whatever force they have at their disposal the exact application of which differs by branch However as both of these are uniformed services police officers and soldiers alike must follow all legitimate orders given by their superiors again there are considerable differences as to what constitutes a legitimate order but the principle remains the same As for the new gear that police officers are being issued much of it such as the less lethal weapons is meant to provide officers with more options with how to approach any scenario they are faced with scenarios which have become more diverse since the pencil notepad handcuff gun days This is meant to create smarter and more flexible responses on the part of police officers This same principle is behind the use of more advanced protective gear The old soft ballistic vests are no longer sufficient for the threats police officers face in the United States they were designed primarily for small calibre handguns not hunting rifles assault rifles and certainly not for the more advanced ammunition that is increasingly becoming available to the average American citizen EDIT They wear camouflage because they bought it from military surplus as it was most likely cheaper than buying tactical clothing made specifically for police officers "
